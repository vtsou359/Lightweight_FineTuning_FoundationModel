Mortgage,"Please note the attached documents were submitted and the BANK OF AMERICA has offered us a cash settlement to sign our interest over to them and we have been trying to work with them for over 5 years on this.! The tax liens are attached to the property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXX. All was filed and documented as you will see attached. This has been such a beyond nightmare and I have received a ton of letters from BANK OF AMERICA stating they would get a resolution, they have kept on and on and back and forth and never want to resolve or give any answers! I am sick of being put on the back burner and treated like a automated letter will go out. I am going to mail, fax and send all XXXX pages of correspondence to you, banking commissions, and any other complaint places because they are wrong! Desired resolution- We will release our unencumbered interest to them for settlement we sent them. This has caused my family to break up, move XXXX times and end result wasted a ton of my time when all they had to do was work with us originally. It is so beyond fair that people just have to let BOA give them what they want because they do n't care. I am actually sick of playing games and getting all this correspondence, letters, sign this and do this and I am not agreeing to a settlement until it is right."
Mortgage,"I contacted Bank of America about dropping the PMI insurance from my mortgage since our house has appreciated and we now owe less than 80 % of the home value based on market price. I was told they have a process to reevaluate the home based on the market price and comps within the area. Today, I received a letter stating they can't drop PMI within the first 2 years ( which they did not state before ). They said the only example of dropping the PMI within the first 2 years is if I make a lump sum payment to reduce the loan value to less than 80 % of the original price"

Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX filed complaint XXXX but the attachment was too big so have scanned it into 3 attachments plus the letter with the pile of documents recd from Bank of America 's bankruptcy and state case XXXX -appeal XXXX attorneys. 
First the state cases where BoA attorneys filed appearance for Government National Mortgage Assoc, FHA and XXXX  an electronic tracking system to get case dismissed using the federal agencies as credibility.

Letter date XX/XX/XXXX plus 14 days = XX/XX/XXXX problem? it was received Sat XX/XX/XXXX with XX/XX/XXXX as the deadline to sign or it is void. no wonder 88 % of BoA modifications do not go through -- more money to foreclose and FHA will pay on the insured mortgage except my FHA mortgage is a forgery found in an $ XXXX pool sold to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I am also attaching what was filed in court. XXXX will be interesting to see the Court 's reaction when XXXX Judges find out BoA attorneys manipulated them."
Mortgage,"Bank of America - attempt to get a mortgage rate modification Case number : XXXX On Page XXXX of Proposed Resolution Letter Final with Enclosures, referring to the paragraph "" Our research confirmed ... '', I was unable to pay such an astronomical amount to reinstate the account. This is their reason for attempting to foreclose and take the house from me. The lawyer ( referred to below ) advised me otherwise regarding making payments, submission of required documentation, and qualification for a loan modification which was reversed several times. In addition the bank tried no less than 20 times to foreclose during this period when they did n't give me a chance to try and make payments, because they wanted an astronomical amount to reinstate and yet also unfairly disqualified me. 
This is unfair and will appeal this outcome until I am properly recompensated. Please also contact the attorney below who claimed he was trying to work with the bank on my behalf.

Mortgage,"At the beginning of the Coronavirus epidemic, I contacted Bank of America seeking financial assistance with my HELOC. This contact was initiated by a phone call that I made XXXX XXXX, 2020. My account was placed into forbearance at that time according to the CSR that I spoke with. Online access to my account was restricted at that time as well. 

I never received any contact from B of A regarding the end of the forbearance, only weekly solicitations regarding further payment assistance. As the 90 day anniversary of my initial contact was rapidly approaching, I called B of A to arrange to remove my account from forbearance, so I could make payments online in the normal manner. I waited 2 hours and 20 minutes to reach someone. The CSR I spoke to at that time said that my account could not be removed from forbearance because there was an outstanding balance, so I authorized a payment of {$2300.00}, the total amount that was due at the time, by phone during that conversation on XXXX/XXXX/2020. I was told that the forbearance would be removed since my account had been made current. 

I continued to attempt to access my account info and begin to make payment arrangements online. I was told by a CSR in early XXXX that the forbearance was due to expire XX/XX/XXXX, which confirms information sent to me by their internal messaging system, that a Special Forbearance Agreements and Terms letter was sent to me XXXX/XXXX/2020, and that apparently is the date that forbearance began. I was still unable to access my account information, so with yet another payment coming close to 30 days late, I contacted them again by phone XX/XX/2020 in order to rectify this. I had been sent a statement showing {$1000.00} due, which included the amount of {$370.00} showing due as a past due amount. This {$370.00} amount makes no sense to me, I am not sure where I owe it. Anyway, I authorized payment of the {$1000.00} total amount during that phone call, and was told once again that since that was paid, and my account was now current, it would be removed from forbearance. The CSR assured me that this matter had been escalated, and that I would definitely hear back from someone the next day. 

It is now 3 days since that phone conversation, and has been 2 days since I should have been called back. I still can not access my account information online, so I called again today. I was able to speak to a CSR right away, pleasant enough, but it felt like the same run around. I was told that I must have been assigned a new account number, and I needed to search for a letter or email informing me of this. This suggesting that all issues were from something I did wrong, even though I was still able to access my account through the online dashboard ( just not able to proceed further ), and process payments by phone into that account. I was told variously that forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX, that something unusual was going on with my account, that it would be taken out of forbearance once all kinds of different steps were completed. Passed around to several CSR 's. I started with a rep named XXXX. This was escalated to a supervisor by the name of XXXX  XXXX. I was supposed to be transferred to a Customer Relations Manager by the name of XXXX XXXX, whose voicemail conveniently hung up on me after an almost 2 hour session trying to get a resolution. 

All I asked for was confirmation in black and white that removal of this forbearance had begun. Nobody would take personal responsibility for initiating this procedure, claiming that the email address they have on record can't be trusted to be secure, that the Message Center feature of their website can't be trusted to be secure. I was just expected to go away, and when I didn't, I was transferred to a supervisor who allowed her voice mail to hang up on me."
Mortgage,"My loan was listed in the Federal law suit filed by the, Department Of Justice against the banks. The banks agreed to settle the law suit that was initiated. 
As per the XXXX XXXX 2016 settlement {$8.00} to {$16.00} XXXX dollars went to investors and home owners for mortgage fraud. I am filing a claim for payment of {$9.00} XXXX Dollars ( XXXX ) that is rightfully my fairs hare of the {$16.00} XXXX Dollar Settlement awarded on XXXX XXXX, 2016. My loan was included in the Mortgage Bond Settlement with Bank Of America and XXXX for property XXXX, NY XXXX. 
The loan was not a viable loan, the loan violated XXXX, RESPA, REGULATION Z, TILA, FAIR HOUSING based on AGE DISCRIMINATION. I was taken advantage of. The loan was a predatory loan. Also, the bank never provided me with the Good Faith Estimate prior to issuing the loan. Both Title company and the Bank refused to give me copies of any of the documents they presented to me for me to sign. I did not receive any documents prior to closing, during closing or after the closing. 
Please advise and forward all the proper documents needed to file a formal complaint and request for my fair share of the {$1600.00} XXXX Dollar Settlement."
Mortgage,"I, XXXX XXXX, ( the "" Borrower '' ) am the innocent victim of foreclosure fraud perpetrated by BANK AMERICA, N.A. ( the "" Lender '' ). Lender is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX, ATTN : XXXX XXXX XXXX, CEO, tel. ( XXXX ). Borrower 's Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) Account No. is XXXX. Borrower 's Bank America, N.A. 's Checking Account No. is XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

According to the terms of Borrower 's HELOC contract with Lender ( successor to XXXX XXXX ) dated and commenced on XX/XX/XXXX, funds to pay for the monthly Periodic Finance Charge ( interest and interest only ) as stipulated by the Automatic Payment Authorization provision in the HELOC contract are to be debited monthly. 

This above-referenced debiting from Borrower 's checking account occurred successfully and faultlessly from the HELOC loan 's inception until XX/XX/XXXX, a period of almost eight ( 8 ) years, when the Lender put Borrower 's HELOC loan into "" default '' status claiming there were insufficient funds in his checking account to pay for that month 's Periodic Finance Charge. On the contrary, Borrower has endorsed Bank America, N.A. deposit slip proof indicating the funds in cash were in Borrower 's checking account per the terms of the HELOC contract each and every month through the present date. Lender commenced a fraudulent foreclosure action upon the Borrower without ever providing a truthful and valid reason as to the cause as to why and how there could be insufficient funds in Borrower 's checking account. 

The Lender never truthfully nor timely nor completely responded to Borrower 's multiple verbal as well as written requests to answer the reason for the insufficient funds. After several years, the Borrower ascertained that the Lender illegally and fraudulently debited the Borrower 's checking account to pay a Lender-Placed Flood Policy premium in XX/XX/XXXX. The Lender never complained before this XX/XX/XXXX date, an approximate eight ( 8 ) year period, that the Borrower was ever not compliant with his flood policy coverage per the terms .of the HELOC contract.Instead, the Lender illicitly debited the Borrower 's checking account."
Mortgage,"The loan was transferred back to Bank of America ( BOA ), after several years with XXXX XXXX and then XXXX XXXX. This transfer occurred in late XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was established by the Bankruptcy Court ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) as a fixed rate, interest only loan. However, Bank of America claimed that the mortgage was a variable rate mortgage and increased the loan from {$1200.00} per month to {$2100.00} per month, beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Bank of America and sent them documentation showing the correct information, including the amended plan of reorganization approved by the Bankruptcy Court.  BOA claimed they had no records from when they had the loan previously. I got letters each month, stating they were "" working on it '' but nothing was ever resolved. I paid off the loan in XX/XX/XXXX.  BOA never resolved the mistake and never issued a refund. I contacted the fraud section of BOA many months after the loan was paid off and was assured someone would contact me. I never got a returned phone call or a letter."
Mortgage,"As I was reviewing my account using the online banking service ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I noticed there was an additional amount totaling over {$7000.00} under my mortgage payment amount ( {$1100.00} ). I called BOA the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to get clarity, I was told "" due to my loan modification, I was placed on escrow for delinquent taxes. I ensured the representative ( XXXX ) that I am not nor have I ever been on a loan modification and nor have I ever been delinquent in paying my yearly taxes. She stated that she would put in a request to find out more information and transferred me to another department. I was transferred to four different people during this 1 hour and 8-minute phone call. Each representative insisting that I was on a loan modification and that I was delinquent. In fact, one representative continued to literally scream at me that I was delinquent, due to your delinquency, if you had not been delinquent... I was told that the tax companies informed BOA that I was delinquent. 

I contacted XXXX collections group to get clarity as I had previously paid my school taxes ( XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX via the drop box at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I was told that my payment had been received along with BOA 's payment. The representative clarified that I was not delinquent, nor have I ever been delinquent in paying my tax. He also stated that they would contact the homeowner if there was a delinquency. 

I received a letter in the mail from BOA dated XX/XX/XXXX, post marked XX/XX/XXXX. I received in my mailbox on XX/XX/XXXX. This letter stated that an escrow account has been established for my mortgage, done at my request or due to lender placed insurance or delinquent taxes paid on my behalf. 

I have been with Bank of America ( BOA ) for 23 years ( XXXX divorced/single homeowner ). I have never been an escrow client. This tax season, without my knowledge, BOA placed me on escrow and paid my XXXX taxes XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Not only did they pay this years taxes, they opened an escrow advance ( {$880.00} ). 

I was contacted back on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX, transferred to XXXX, transferred to XXXX. I was told by XXXX that she would research and call me back in XXXX hours. 

I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX didn't receive in my mailbox XX/XX/XXXX stating BOA completed research on property tax on this account as I have requested, and if I had questions or need assistance, call them back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a refund of {$5100.00} from XXXX XXXX, went to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX to deposit, hold release on XX/XX/XXXX. I informed BOA that I have the funds to return to them. 

XXXX hour and XXXX minutes -I received a call from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, she explained that BOA XXXX for delinquencies with the tax office and was informed that I had not paid my taxes, so BOA paid. She just wanted to get back to me with information. She transferred me to XXXX. XXXX could not answer anything or give clarity on anything, she transferred me to XXXX in loss mitigation. She confirmed that I do not have a loan modification. She then transferred me to XXXX in escrow who tried her best to conceptualize the situation, told me I had to pay the mortgage amount of {$2200.00} in XXXX due to the escrow. The only way the escrow would come off was if I paid the outstanding balance, if I paid my regular mortgage payment, the payment would not post and will go to escrow first, so I would be late with my mortgage payment. 

She then transferred me to XXXX on the property tax team. XXXX told me that XXXX taxes were delinquent, BOA paid delinquency fees from last year as well as this years taxes, including penalties and fees. Again, I explained to her that I have never been delinquent on any taxes, this was the first ever that I have heard about XXXX delinquencies ( which I am not ). She stated that she would reach out to the tax companies, put in a request for more information. She said that she would call me back next week. 

With every representative I spoke with I explained that I have never been on a loan modification or been delinquent with my taxes. I explained that the tax bill gives the property owner XXXX options to pay by certain due dates ; XXXX at a discounted rate, XXXX face amount rate, XXXX a penalty rate. Taxes are not considered delinquent until XX/XX/XXXX of the next year. I pay my taxes within the confines of the options, and do so every year. I have never had an issue with my tax companies or BOA ever with my taxes and the way I make my payments. 

I also explained that last year ( XX/XX/XXXX ) BOA opened an escrow account, without my knowledge and paid homeowners insurance in the amount of ( {$1000.00} ). I have always paid my homeowners insurance monthly in the amount of {$130.00}. Again, I was notified that the insurance company contacted BOA stating that I didn't pay my premium. During that call the BOA representative told me that an escrow was being opened for my taxes also, during communication, the representative corrected BOAs error and I was not placed on tax escrow .... however, I had to call my homeowners company and research. I was told, I have never been late or without insurance, and they would contact me being the policy holder. I was returned the {$1000.00} and in turn sent it to BOA, they applied it as well as returned {$56.00} late fee that posted. 
No one can answer why I am being targeted this year. Not only for this year, but added fees for XXXX. 

My mortgage payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, due to pay, I always pay on either the XXXX or XXXX of the month, I have never been late, nor accrued late charges. My mortgage history shows perfect credit. My statement history has never shown escrow. 

Tomorrow XX/XX/XXXX I will be calling each tax office to conduct my own research on XXXX, what transpired, if someone was double paid, etc... I will also again conduct research for this year, XXXX."
Mortgage,"The mortgage lender for our home loan is Bank of America. We moved into our home in XXXX and in XXXX I lost my job and we began trying to work unsucessfully with BOA and are still being challenged with trusting, getting support, and responsiveness with BOA. They are giving us the run around, denied assistance, provided minimal assistance that was n't helpful and then simply are unresponsive in our modification process now. This has been going on since XXXX. 
1. We were denied assistance in XXXX because my spouse holds the loan but I lost my job. BOA told us they couldnt help us repeadedly. Our household income was reduced by XXXX. In XXXX I was underemployed working part time for approx XXXX a year and we requested assistance. We were approved for a trial modification reducing mortgage for {$180.00} a month. We could n't accept because we could n't even afford the reduced amount. We paid XXXX mortgage payments instead, rejected the modification, and tried to borrow $ from family and when work bonuses were received we tried to catch up. 
3. We continued to struggle, I was re-employed full time making 30 % less than the career I had before, were still struggling, went into forclosure in XXXX, took XXXX dispursements to get out, and we are still struggling. 
4. XXXX we have enormous debt, we cant catch up, we have sold all stocks to reduce the debt, we have high expenses, over XXXX in medical bill debt. We began the modification process in XXXX XXXX and as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we are still in it and ca n't get this process moving. We have been given the runaround, the process does n't tell you what additional information you need to send, they send the same letter over and over again without specific info on what they need just the boiler plate list of required documents, they do n't communicate with you, respond to emails or call back, meetings scheduled have been no shows on part of BOA, and the phone numbers they provide on their website do n't work. We have lost trust that we will get help and although we are paying or mortgage. we have bills that ca n't be paid ont he other side like car payments, daycare, etc. We have complied with everything they have asked and then some. This process needs an overhaul. HAMPT is meant to help homeowners not give then the run around. I 'm sure there are others in this same class that could come forward to validate these complaints. Its terrible."
Mortgage,"This is my ordeal of trying to get my overpayment and escrow refund from bank of america mortgage dept. 
On XXXX the XX/XX/2020 my home loan account with Bank of america was paid off. I had by mistake made double payment for my last mortgage installment on XXXX XXXX. So I called BOA mortgage service helpline XXXX on XXXX of XX/XX/2020. The person on the phone told me that since this is an overpayment this would be refunded by ACH to your account by Thursday XX/XX/2020. When I did not receive money on Thursday I called them on Thursday at XXXX XXXX  PST time. The executive on the phone told me that our end of day is 12 midnight not the end of business hours. I said ok I will wait. Money has not shown in my account so far. 

I called them twice and after waiting for 2 hours on the phone, the automated system said you would receive a call in 48 hours, which I never received. 
I called again after 2 days and again the automated system said after waiting for 2 hours that we will call you back in 48 hours, the call back did not happen. 

I emailed them on XX/XX/2020 about the same issue and mentioned the call and whole ordeal with a response saying your payoff money was received on XXXX XXXX, 2020 ( Which is wrong as my payoff was done on XXXX XXXX ) and you would receive your refund by XXXX XX/XX/2020. I was really frustrated with the financial stress and lack of service. 

I called them again and I was told your check has been processed and sent over to you on XXXX XXXX and you would receive it within 2 weeks working days. 

I called again on XX/XX/2020 as we near the end of 2 weeks period as well and Talked to XXXX then Flow. A manager was supposed to call back and check with me if I received the check. No call came. 

I called again on XX/XX/2020, this time I was lucky that I met XXXX XXXX. She told me Check is usually sent 10 days after receiving funds and in your case No check was ever sent. XXXX XXXX. She talked to her manager XXXX XXXX ( Manager ) when I requested could you please expedite the check delivery. Her manager approved and I was relieved that now I would be receiving my check. Unfortunately not. 
I called again on Monday/Tuesday and talked to an executive first who told me it will take 2 days for stop payment and then a new check would be issued and sent to you. I insisted on talking to manager and she transferred me to manager named XXXX. She was very rude and also told me that it will take 2 weeks for my check to be delivered. I still have not received the check. 

I followed them on the phone almost every second day with an average 90 mins of wait time and yet have not received my check. It's been almost 50 days although the law is 20 days. My address with them is correct as I have been receiving regular mail from Bank of america as well as mortgage service. 
Here are the service ticket numbers that executives shared with me : XXXX XXXX XXXX I hereby request : My escrow and overpaid mortgage payment be released with immediate effect I should be paid an amount of {$5000.00} for all the time spent on the calls waiting, sending them email communication for the time spent. My due payments had bounced and my account went in negative balance. In addition I should be paid {$10000.00} for all the mental stress I had to go through Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,Bank of America was supposed to credit my mortgage for the excessive amount Bank of America charged me for the Homeowners Insurance Policy as Bank of America placed Lender Placed Insurance which was inflated as the policy was issued by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX both subsidiaries of Bank Of America. Attached is the court order to pay me for the excessive charges Bank of America has charged me.
Mortgage,"Bank of America never sent a lien release on my house since I paid off my mortgage to them on  XXXX   XXXX ,  2016 . My mortgage loan number was  XXXX . I called their number at  XXXX . I spoke with Bank of America representative  XXXX . She gave me a reference number of my complaint as  XXXX . She told me th at the county did  not record the lien release which in fact is not true. She told me there was nothing Bank of America could do. I went to  XXXX   County and obtained copies of the DEED OF TRUST. The county never received the lien release from Bank of America. By law, Bank of America should have released the lien. See attached document for pro of of payoff and their statement about the lien release documents.   I have currently applied for an equity loan with my credit union. They can not close the loan to me because Bank of America never filed the lien release. It is unlawful of Bank of America to be preventing me from obtaining my equity loan and further threatening the delay of my existing interest rate."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX my wife and I were discussing our mortgage payments, balance, and interest paid year-to-date XXXX. While looking at our most recent Bank of America ( BAC ) mortgage statement ( XX/XX/XXXX statement ), we noticed that we'd paid more interest thus far in XXXX than we did during the entire XXXX  year. We also noticed in the statement that the next payment due was not until XX/XX/XXXX. Upon further investigation on our part, we discovered that the overpayments that we had been forwarding to BAC were NOT being applied to the principle of the loan balance. In a conversation with their mortgage customer service representative, we subsequently learned that the over-payments were being applied to future payments. We explained that with each over-payment, there were written instructions for the over-payment to be applied towards principal balance. We also explained that we had no intentions of pre-paying future payments and interest that had not yet been accrued. We have spoken with a number of BAC mortgage representatives at this point, who've all cited that it's their policy to apply overage payments to future payments. In our attempts to rectify this issue, we have instructed the bank to forward a full payment history for our mortgage account, that demonstrates payment allocation for principal, interest, fees; including the application of any payment overages. After a conversation with the bank, we were instructed that BAC would apply the additional payments towards the principal loan balance. In an online statement we viewed on XX/XX/XXXX, we were able to confirm that the additional payments were applied to the principal, and the principal had been reduced. We asked BAC to confirm whether any interest that we inappropriately paid due to the misapplication of our payments be refunded and applied to the principal as well. We are still not sure if that has been applied correctly ; thus they have agreed to forward a full payment history and amortization schedule. Our concerns are the misapplication of payments intended for reduction of principal balance, deceptive practices by BAC as they did not previously nor beforehand explain their policy in applying overage payments of our mortgage towards future payments, BAC ignored written instructions on each payment they received from us to apply overage payments to the principal balance, and BAC 's inappropriate practices proactively worked to inhibit the early payoff of our mortgage loan. We are filing a formal complaint against Bank of America and their inappropriate practices that work to inhibit early payoffs for mortgage loans. We also want to issue a formal complaint that Bank of America proactively worked against our original mortgage agreement that explains no penalty for early payoff."
Mortgage,"Bank of America ( B of A ) has repeatedly and continues to violate RESPA, Reg X Multiple CFPB, Banking and other Banking and federal regulations and laws in the servicing of our mortgage. Refer ty attached document entitled 'CFPB Complaint Summary Page Escrow 2-2020 ' for full details."
Mortgage,"ON or about XX/XX/XXXX CountryWide Home loans INC allegedly sold my note for my house to XXXX AS TRUSTEE FOR HOLDERS OF XXXX XXXX ARM TRUST, MORTAGE PASS- THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES XXXX, but prior to that transaction I have evidence that has come forth by way of collateral file. A Deed of trust from CountryWide Home Loans INC transferring all beneficial interests to XXXX XXXX as trustee for the note the date this occured was XX/XX/XXXX. along with this DOT was a allonge endosed to XXXX XXXX. 
Somtime in the year of XX/XX/XXXX CHL decided to void out the allonge and stamp on the original note a blank endorsement so that they could allegedly sell it to the trust. CHL has commited mortgage fraud, spoilation of evidence, S.E.C. fraud that violates trust laws, these violations need to be investigated thourghly."
Mortgage,"To whom it may concern, On or around XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX I applied for an FHA mortgage through bank of america. I met on site with one of their mortgage loan officers XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX. I filled out all of the pre-qualification paperwork and she then ran my credit report. Based on what she found she said my DTI was at 34 % and I was eligible for an FHA loan through bank of america. She told me of some documents Id need such as bank statements, tax returns, and pay stubs which I provided to her within 24 hours. I went to her office several times in the course of two weeks giving her papers and filling out more. Of which was questions about inquiries on my credit report and where they came from. XXXX is XXXX, and a bit hard to understand so as she was reading off the inquiries from her computer she had me write down my answers on a blank piece of paper. She asked me about one inquiry from XXXX. I had no heard of them so my response was that it was possible they were either a mortgage company while I was shopping around or personal loan company while I was shopping to consolidate my credit cards. But that I did not recognize the name and did not use them. A week later she calls me and asks about a loan with XXXX, who I did have a loan with starting in XXXX of XXXX. I told her yes I had a loan through them but she did not ask me about XXXX when we went over the credit report. Apparently its XXXX/XXXX  but as she read that off to me originally she did not read the full name and hence the confusion began. From there she informed me that my DTI might now be too high. I was confused and frustrated that she had taken so long to figure this out when it was information easily accessed in my bank records. On top of that asking me for the same documents several times over and misinforming me as to what type of gift letter BOA would accept. Now being only one weekend away from our contract date for loan approval, I contacted her manager XXXX XXXX who is VP for their branch. After a week of no response from him with either phone calls or emails he finally got back to me and offered help. Told me that they would fast track things and get a credit supplement done quickly. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent me an updated needs list, of the things on the list was the original loan application to fill out yet again. I filled out all documents the same day and returned them in person the following afternoon. Now we are well past our approval date as per contract. From there an entire week goes by where neither XXXX or XXXX will return any messages or call me back. I emailed and called and nothing. No status updates at all. I contacted several people at BOA including XXXX XXXX who gave me the name and contact info for their district manager XXXX XXXX. I called and emailed him for status updates and got more of the same silence. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX finally emails me back saying he will contact the under writing manager and get things fast track. Finally after calling every day and not having any responses XXXX contacted me on XX/XX/XXXX to tell me that she hadnt heard anything back from underwriting and was still waiting to hear. The next day on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX calls to tell me that my loan wasn't approved because of my DTI. That day I sent an email to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX requesting a letter of denial so I could show proof for my contract purposes, and a transfer of the FHA case number and appraisal to my new loan officer XXXX XXXX. XXXX followed up with another request and XXXX XXXX responded by email on XX/XX/XXXX saying that the request to transfer the FHA case number had been submitted. Come Monday XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called and emailed each day inquiring about the transfer and was met with harsh attitude and assurance that it had already been transferred. She explained to XXXX that it had not and was still under bank of america. Emails were sent to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX again each day requesting the letter of denial, and transfer of FHA number. No calls or emails were returned. On top of that it was brought to my attention that XXXX XXXX told both my new loan officer XXXX, and the sellers agent XXXX XXXX, that I was a liar and did not disclose that I had a personal loan. This is unprofessional and slanderous. Now we have to go through a whole process through FHA to get a new loan number and change our closing date. This puts both my family and the sellers family in a problematic situation, all because bank of america could not provide timely acceptance or denial of loan. Now they intentionally block the transfer process to make it difficult or impossible to continue it on with a new and professional mortgage loan officer. I have all emails saved and am willing to provide any additional information that you made need. I ask for your assistance in this so these loan officers at bank of america can no longer foul up peoples lives with laziness and misinformation."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2020 the governor of Massachusetts shut down our state over concern about the COVID-19 virus. 

As a result my wife and myself were both laid off from our jobs. 

In early XXXX, Bank of America, being our mortgage holder, graciously offered us the opportunity of a three month payment postponement which we took advantage of ( see copy of acceptance attached ). 

The agreement states that "" the three months postponed payments will be due at a later date, after the three month period has ended. XXXX will work with us on repayment options, including the potential option to add the payments to the end of our loan ''.

The three months have now passed and Bank of America is now threating foreclosure if we do not pay {$9100.00} in missed payments and late fees. XXXX was not serious on working with us on repayment options since they have the payment after the three months "" payment postponement '' period. 

This agreement is clearly a scam on Bank of America 's part to collect late fees by delaying the payments required. 

This is also troubling since we are both still unemployed and risk losing your home. 
Additionally XXXX XXXX may be violating our Governors eviction moratorium by threatening us with foreclosure."
Mortgage,"I was pre-approved for a purchase on a 4plex with Bank of America and was quoted a 2.875 rate. We then submitted an offer under the impression that if we qualify on the financing we would have a 2.875 rate because of this rate we moved forward to then submit an offer, do our du diligence inspections, and paid for an appraisal. 

Our loan officer locked in our rate, and we were issued an loan estimate ( please see attached ) While sitting in escrow for over 5 weeks, we were told by the loan officer that we are approved for the loan but she applied us for the wrong loan and can no longer honor the quoted rate for a 4plex. Instead the loan for the type of property we are purchasing has a rate of 4.5 % which is a 2 % discrepancy. Even though we have in writing that we had our rate locked and are still within our LOCK RATE time period. 

We are not 5 weeks into this transaction have spend lots of time and money on this purchase, have potentially lost other opportunities. And have been misquote by the bank and applied under the wrong loan. How can a bank LOCK IN our rate and then come back to tell us that they can not honor the rate they quoted us- not based on our financial capacity but due to their error of applying us for the incorrect loan.

We are now seeking help and have escalated this matter up 4 levels of management and have still not been given a resolution.

We are not 2 weeks passed our contingency period and not sure what our rights are and how we are protected as we feel we have been given a bate and switch."

Mortgage,My problems started when I was with Bank of America and I was going into foreclosure and contacted them about a modified loan I went through a local lawyer and paid her {$3500.00} to obtain a modified loan for me she obtained the modified loan and I signed the paperwork in front of her in her office and it was sent back to Bank of America. I paid on a modified loan for three and a half years and Bank of America decided they could no longer honor that contract because my house was in transition from XXXX XXXX to Bank of America but I was not notified that XXXX XXXX still had ownership of my loan. I was informed  by Bank of America they BOA had bought the loan three years prior to my problem with my modified loan.It was my understanding that Bank of America had the right to give me a modified loan. BOA had the right to make that decision for me to have a modified loan. Then after 3 1/2 yrs. they decided that they did not have true ownership of my loan. XXXX XXXX still obtain ownership of my loan. So bank of america threw my house into foreclosure again.What happened from that was I got a sheriff knocking on my door saying my house is in foreclosure. I went to the local legal free legal help agency to obtain me a new modified loan unfortunately my first modified loan and my original loan I only had seven years left to pay on my loan.When I got my first modified loan they had extended it 3 more years to make up for the time that I was unable to pay and I got behind trying to get a modified loan. It took me a year and a half to get a modified loan with my new lawyer.After my new lawyer contacted Bank of America for the new modified loan under their contract their representative told my new lawyer the reason i needed another modify was because of the wells fargo incident. Bank of America told my lawyer that my loan was increased to a 40 year mortgage at about the same amount of money I was paying before. So now I have a 40 year mortgage instead of a 7 year mortgage when my lawyer pressed harder Bank of America told my lawyer that the reason they could not honor the first modified loan after three and a half years was XXXX XXXX still had ownership of my loan at the time and bank of america did not have the leagal right to modify my loan the first time.No one bothered to tell me this. There was no information there was no disclosure that my loan had not been switched over although I was paying Bank of America for three and a half years not XXXX XXXX. My second lawyer also informed me that my first lawyer was being sued by the state because of illegal loan modification practices. Now I am in bankruptcy over this I 've had to put my house in bankruptcy to save my house it has ruined all my credit and everything I have Bank of America has recently within the past six months sold my loan again to get out from underneath what they have caused me and I still can not find anyone to straighten this out. XXXX XXXX and Bank of America are at fault for this someone dropped the ball they let it go for three and a half years and no one did anything about it but give me a 40 year mortgage which means I 'll be XXXX years old paying a mortgage on my house and I 'll be paying on a home loan I already paid on for 15 years so I 'll be paying on my house for 55 years. I have been fighting this for some time and unable to find help from anyone or any lawyer. Can u please help me fight XXXX XXXX and bank of america for the nondisclosure and the trap with my home loans they have put me in. I am underwater in my house because of these two banks swindling me.
Mortgage,"Acct. XXXX
XXXX
I am requesting a copy of my Home Apprasial that was done in XX/XX/2015 from my lender Bank Of America. I dont have a copy. They claim they cant locate it. I am trying to have my taxes assessed and need to bring a copy to my hearing."
Mortgage,"I have mortgage from Bank of America for my home. I purchased home ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) of {$200000.00}. I took mortgage of {$180000.00} ( 11 % ). Thus, I have PMI insurance on mortgage. My current principal balance on mortgage is {$150000.00} which is 74.6 % LTV ratio. When I called Bofa for first time to request cancel PMI ( principal balance {$160000.00} ) they told me my LTV ratio of mortgage need to be lower than 78 % and I need to do home valuation report but if I have principal balance less then 75 % then I don't need home valuation. At that time my LTV ratio was 78.28 %. Thus, I deposit more money towards principal and I request again for canceling my PMI at {$150000.00} ( principal balance ) which is 74.6 % LTV ratio.

At this time, Bofa stating they can not cancel my PMI until XX/XX/XXXX year because that was the date loan supposed to be at 78 % according to amortization schedule. According to Federal law I am eligible to cancel my PMI, once it is less then 78 %. I have continuously make regular payment and deposit more each month towards principal. It's becoming racket by Bofa. Each time I am getting different response by Bofa to decline my request."
Mortgage,"I have contacted Bank of America ( aka BofA ) several times to remove my PMI ; both in writing and customer service calls. I have made timely mortgage payments for over 9 years now, my balance is below 80 % of the original appraised value ( LTV ). 

I first contacted BofA in writing XX/XX/XXXX to have PMI removed ; my PMI would not be removed without a new appraisal being done was the response. 

I contacted BofA again in writing on XX/XX/XXXX to have PMI removed ; BofA said my PMI was close to bring removed. 

Recently ( summer of XXXX ), with a customer service call a BofA rep verbally shared that my PMI would be removed by XX/XX/XXXX. I just recieved my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage statement from BofA and my PMI of $ XXXX/month is still there. I'm puzzled and at a loss, no seeking CFPB 's assistance. Based on the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or HPA, my PMI should have been removed months ago.

I'm hoping the CFPB can help me 1 ) have my PMI removed, 2 ) Get any back PMI owed to me paid to me from BofA, & 3 ) get an explanation from BofA."
Mortgage,"I reached out to you this month regarding my mortgage. Bank of America was informed of my complaint. They did contact me afterwards confirming it was me ( XXXX XXXX ) who contacted you. The rep said I will receive something in the mail. In which I got Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) The attachment I am sending is basically the same brief conversation I had on the phone. I did as instructed and only got voicemail. I will call again today to see what happens but Im not getting anywhere. 

The complaint is a follow up on this. 

Since XXXX I have been trying to work with countrywide for a fixed affordable mortgage. During negotiations, countrywide sold to Bank of America without fixing or modifying my mortgage. I proceeded with Bank of America to get a fixed affordable rate. The same employee I spoke to for my modification is from countrywide, now a BAC representative. Things are worse for me because the pandemic and The employee made it clear because of the pandemic its impossible to refinance and they will not help/negotiate anything and so now were in forbearance. Meanwhile adding more money to the end of the mortgage so they can add more interest on forbearance. The mortgage started at {$180000.00} and will now be {$270000.00} and climbing so all they have done to help us raise my principal {$90000.00}. I am looking for any help I can get or a referral. NOTE : The original mortgage terms was {$50000.00} at 12 % plus {$180000.00} with fluctuating mortgage rate. I was able to pay off the {$50000.00} while struggling with the other. As a first time home buyer I didnt know what I was getting into. All Im hoping is to have a fixed mortgage at a fair interest that is affordable."
Mortgage,"This letter is to attest to several instances of maleficence on the part of Bank of America that resulted in extreme financial hardship for me. There are three specific separate but related matters I would like to file a complaint about and have included my request for resolution at the end of each section. 

Matter 1 I have attached the letters from Bank of America proving their mistake in regards to the matter discussed below. 

I was approved for Corona hardship deferment back in XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I applied for a 3 month extension of the deferment ( as I had several times before ) but my request was not serviced or responded to. The confirmation number for the extension request that was missed is : XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I began to be contacted by Bank of America that A mortgage payment had been missed. I attempted to contact BOA to find out what had happened but received no response from my account manager and was never able to contact a live person. As a result I simply reapplied for the extension this time via the phone system. This extension was approved but what I admit that I didn't realize at the time was that it was changed from a deferment to a "" forbearance '' at that time. I received a letter stating the forbearance was good through XXXX, XXXX which is attached. The following month I received another letter stating my forbearance was now good through XX/XX/XXXX. This letter is also attached. No explanation was given for these dates or their changes. 

It was on XX/XX/XXXX when I went to resume payments on the mortgage that I realized that a mistake had been made re. my deferment had been changed to a forbearance. At this time I once again began attempting to contact BOA to determine what was going on. They finally got back to me in the middle of XXXX. I explained the above situation and pointed out the letters and the confirmation number of the original request above. They agreed that an error had been made and referred my account to the research department. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter informing me that my account had NOW been approved to be in deferment through XX/XX/XXXX. This letter is also attached. 

This IMMEDIATELY caused me to show as being 3 months late in payments despite having never missed a payment that showed as due. In "" fixing '' the original error that switched my account from deferment to forbearance Bank of America caused my mortgage to be 3 months delinquent to the tune of my current past due amount of {$3700.00}. Please again note that my account was never delinquent until I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX ( again attached ), resetting my deferment to XX/XX/XXXX 3 months earlier suddenly causing me to be 3 months late in payments according to the system. I resumed making my regular monthly payments immediately but I can not afford the past due amount that is a result of Bank of America 's mismanagement of my account. 

I am requesting Bank of America move my past due amount and escrow to the end of my mortgage without forcing me to do a loan modification. I am not asking for the amount to be forgiven or my monthly payment lowered. 

Matter 2 Bank of America says that the only way to rectify the past due amount on my account is to apply for a loan modification. I am doing so but it is a long and arduous process as I am a XXXX member. XXXX is a program whose mission is to provide affordable homeownership to low-to-moderate-income people and communities. Bank of America makes it extremely difficult for XXXX members to do anything related to their mortgage. Bank of America assured me that while this past due amount was in dispute and I applied for the loan modification I would not be negatively reported to the credit bureaus. However, they have now done so twice causing my credit score to plummet from a rating of Excellent to Poor in a matter of a month. I am requesting Bank of America completely remove its negative reporting of my account to the credit bureaus until this matter is resolved. 

Matter 3 As briefly alluded to above Bank of America treats XXXX members as second class clients. I am not able to reach a real person to discuss anything regarding my mortgage. Bank of Americas phone system makes you put in the mortgage account number before transferring you. XXXX members are able to immediately reach a mortgage customer service representative to discuss their account, this was attested to me by the independent mortgage counselor Bank of America assigned to reach out to me to discuss my past due amount. I discussed my situation with him and he tried to call Bank of America in order to help me discuss the issue. He was shocked to discover that he could not get through to a mortgage representative for my account. He said he had never encountered that before. 

Instead XXXX members are sent to the voicemail box of their account manager and forced to leave a message which they are told will be returned in a maximum of 1 business day. These calls are regularly not returned at all and if they are its usually at least a week. I have left well over two dozen voicemails over the past year dealing with this issue and have received a return call twice in that time. I am requesting that Bank of America be forced to treat XXXX clients with the same priority and respect they give other clients. 


XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"We had a mortgage with Countrywide which then became Bank of America back in XXXX. I filed Bankruptcy in XXXX. Discharged XXXX. After the Bankruptcy we continued to make payments to Bank of America for our XXXX. During the next 7 years we applied fro Loan Modifications on XXXX different times. Bank of America would have us sign and make trial payments. Each time we never received Final Loan Documents. During this time I kept making the modified payments and would call Bank of America regularly to ask why They have not sent us Final loan documents. Was told by Bank of America they would expedite it, but still never received them. We just kept making payments. Bank of America just kept dragging it on to get any payments they could. Now XXXX XXXX, XXXX I find out the Loan was never re-affirmed and that it was part of the bankruptcy and it was discharged. So Bank of America drug this out for so long just to take our money even though it was BK. We paid over $ XXXX. I believe this is Fraud on Bank of America. Please help us get our money back. Property BK now. Backup documents attached are only for recent activity."
Mortgage,"Bank of America ( who gave me a mortgage loan 2.5 years ago ) keeps sending refinance offers with outrageous claims about saving money. 
Their claim : Refinance at a slightly lower rate and save {$4300.00} per year. 
They fail to mention that the extended term on the new loan will increase the total of payments by {$10000.00} under the terms of this advertised refinance offer. It completely fails, in every respect, to make a honest attempt to save me money. In the fine print there 's a statement : "" ... you should carefully consider the potential increase in the total number of monthly payments and/or the total interest charges paid over the full term of the new refinance loan - especially for borrowers who currently have loans with terms less than 30 years. '' This is essentially everyone and is an obvious legal maneuver to avoid responsibility for this ridiculous offer."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX Bank of America # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX CA XXXX This short sale was started XXXX/XXXX/16 with Bank of America. XXXX of the homeowners is XXXX XXXX military. It was only sent to the XXXX department towards the end of XXXX. WHY? Why did Bank of America wait so long to place this loan in the correct department? 

In addition, Bank of America has told us that they will foreclose on an XXXX XXXX service member XXXX. They claimed they could not postpone the foreclosure sale date without a short sale approval. I spoke again with XXXX XXXX today, told him that this is an XXXX XXXX service member and it would be an SCRA violation to foreclose on this property. He said he could do nothing except tell the negotiator assigned, XXXX XXXX. 

Since when is a lender allowed to foreclose on an XXXX XXXX service member XXXX?? 

Thirdly, we are not able to contact the negotiator directly. The information given in equator is invalid, and we have no way of reaching them by phone."
Mortgage,"Dear  Officer  I am filing a new complaint against   Bank of America.
Bank of America promised me by giving me a nu  mber to call (  XXXX  ) to have its higher management to look into my case. I called every day and left the voice box of this number numerous messages. However, the owner of this phone has never talked to me.   This action of Bank   of America is not professional at all. This action of Bank of American is cheating.
Please ask Bank of America to explain why they should cheat their customers.     Thank you!    XXXX   XXXX"
Mortgage,"1. My insurance broker overcharged Bank of America approximately {$10000.00} which they notified me and submitted a check to Bank of America to reimburse them in XXXX of 2021. 
2. Because of the overcharge this placed my escrow account at a negative {$10000.00}.

3. Upon receipt of the approximate {$10000.00} check, Bank of America did not replenish the {$10000.00} in the escrow, but instead took the money and applied to other accounts.

4. This then caused numerous accounting anomalies resulting from the remaining negative escrow account. They, Bank of America, would take my monthly payment and break it up into what I call creative banking accounting, making partial payments to different items. 
5. Then they transferred my mortgage to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2021 with the negative Escrow 6. New lender states I have to replenish my escrow by the end of the month or face legal proceeding 7. I have uploaded the ups reciect that the insurance delivered the check to Bank of America. I also uploaded the Bank statement for XXXX and XXXX showing how they appropiated part of the payment which was not the escrow account."
Mortgage,Bank of America is the problem. we now have a servicing company XXXX but before it went to XXXX bank of America put a lender placed insurance policy on our loan and charged {$160000.00} for the policy. This has been going on for years we were paying our own insurance but every time we got a new date on our policy it auto canceled only the date of the policy so XXXX would always put there on policy on the loan til they got proof of us paying our own. I had sent them many copies but they would say they did not get the proof so then I told my insurance agent to sent them 6 copies well out of the XXXX the finally got 2. we are still paying our insurance that is what was on the loan we pay our own insurance and they escrow the taxes. This has been going on for too long and now they are saying that they want to forclose on our  property because it is getting behind because they are using the money on fees. Please help I make my payment every month.
Mortgage,"I took out a mortgage on my property a year before Countrywide was bought by Bank of America. I was promised by Countrywide that my interest rate would be adjusted after a year or so. The Interest Rate was 8.85 % and my monthly payments have been for {$630.00} /mo. I have never missed or been late on any payment since. I started inquiring about a lower interest rate for my lo re-financing my Mrtg for at least 8 years now and always receive the same answer. Since I do n't have a XXXX XXXX or XXXX account there is nothing that can be done. My mortgage is under {$68.00} and it is still being met every month. 
As of XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX and am getting a little concerned about my ability to continue without a refinance to a lower rate. Of course since the GR I have been under water as my home has assessed for @ half of what it was valued at then. My retireme nt pkg can keep me viable for a while, but who knows how long I can keep going. I have asked at least 5 times to refinance the whole value at a lower rate but they say I am too far under to be considered. 
If you can help me to re-fi I would really be happy. 
I want to pay back what I owe, I only need to reduce my payment. Let me know what I need to do to get you all the necessary information. I have been pay ing this for around 9 years now at 8.85 % I see all these multi thousand dollar mortgages being re done and I do n't understand why they are hesitant to do mine. 
Thanks!

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2018 BOA paid XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars out of my escrow account. The XX/XX/XXXXpage which they received showed a policy total of XXXX dollars and a BALANCE DUE of XXXX dollars. BOA paid in error and has now held me hostage with a negative escrow account. Many attempts have been made to resolve the issue, but misinformation keeps being conveyed such as : We can not issue stop payments on checks ( re : they paid XXXX XXXX XXXX on a cancelled policy just 11 days prior ). They then issued a stop payment on their check to state farm. So which is it? You can or can't issue stop payments? They also lied about the date XXXX XXXX   cashed their check. XXXX XXXX isn't the real issue though, it's the state farm payment of XXXX they made in error and are too incompetent to rectify. I want my XXXX dollars back. I should not have to wait for whatever whacked out process they have which has to date been almost 20 days. They have funds to pay me into a negative state. They should use the same slush fund to pull money from to rectify their error and deal with state farm on the back end to fix the problem BOA created by paying a XXXX dollar balance statement. Meanwhile I am losing interest on the XXXX I had to pay out of pocket."
Mortgage,"Hello. I am XXXX XXXX. This is a new complaint about the way Bank of America ( BofA ) is handling a foreclosure process. I am the homeowner. 

As you know, financial institutions are required to provide timely responses and information during a foreclosure process. BofA also has a burden of continuity of contact. 

In XXXX of XXXX I went through a modification process with BofA. They claimed that I was ineligible for modification. Then, I went through a very brief re-evaluation ( appeal ) process. I was denied in the appeal. During the appeal process, they also made it impossible to get underwriter notes in time to make an accurate appeal. they refused to push the foreclosure sale date out 90 days as expected. They didn't even push it out a full 30 days ( From XX/XX/XXXX moved to XX/XX/XXXX ) After Bank of America denied my appeal, I had new financial information, and I attempted to submit a new request for modification. The, Bank of America actively and intentionally attempted to keep me from submitting a new request for modification in time to save my home from foreclosure. Here is what happened : 1. They finished my appeal but did not send me the denial right away. They waited until it 37 days prior to my foreclosure date. 

2. That day, I attempted to submit a request for modification. I went online to Bank of America 's home loan help portal to submit the new request. Bank of America locked me out of that portal, and I am still locked out of my mortgage account online as well. The Bank of America employees that could help get me back into my account was no longer in the office, so I had to wait until the following day. 

3. 36 days before my foreclosure date I called Bank of America to get into my account. Bank of America told me that I am not allowed to access my account information, because I am in the foreclosure process. Three different groups within Bank of America told me this blatant lie in an attempt to keep me from submitting a request for foreclosure relief. 

4. After Bank of America 's employees lied to me repeatedly and refused to allow me access to submit my request for modification, I got in my car and rushed to the local Bank of America location to try and submit my request. The individual at the bank did not have a fax number that they could use to submit my information. The bank 's assistant manager called into Bank of America 's modification department to get a fax number, but that group was closed. She attempted another phone number, but the person on that line said that they could not provide a fax number for the modification department unless they had permission directly from that department to provide their fax number. In tears, I asked the assistant manager to please submit the request to something, somewhere so that it can be shown that I at least tried. She took my paperwork and went into the back of the bank. She came back a few minutes later and said she sent it off to a fax number she had, but she didn't provide a read receipt. So even the local bank tried to keep me from submitting my modification. 

5. I got home and read through every document, note page, etc. related to Bank of America 's fraud. I knew that I had submitted my previous request for modification through a fax number. At XXXX I found the fax number, and I was able to submit my modification against Bank of America 's active attempts to keep me from seeking foreclosure relief. 

6. In response to their failure to keep me from submitting another request for modification, they attempted to use misinformation to keep me from proceeding with the modification. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating another untruth. It states that in order for a modification to automatically pause a foreclosure date, the modification must be submitted 37 days prior to the foreclosure sale date. 

7. They refuse to pause the sale date, which is in direct violation of federal law. 

8. They have also changed the date my foreclosure process began. They moved it from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This is also not true. I have no idea where that date came from at this point. I could maybe understand XX/XX/XXXX, since my loan was sold to another company for the month of XXXX. 

And a secondary complaint ADA trampled and Dodd/Frank They refuse to allow me the simple ADA accomodation of allowing me to record my calls. I need to do so, because XXXX hit my ability to take in numbers, dates, and times. It's challenging enough without the constant discrimination by Bank of America 's employees like Mitigation Loss Manager, XXXX XXXX. She refused to comply with ADA law and her regulatory compliance department, and she spoke over me constantly when I tried to explain. 

And a third complaint Dodd/Frank trampled As of today, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, my request for modification, that I submitted 36 days prior to my home 's sale date, has yet to be submitted to an underwriter. 

And a fourth complaint Dodd/Frank trampled Even though I submitted my request for modification prior to the 36 day mark, they have yet to postpone the foreclosure of my home. They are selling/stealing it in 14 days. 

And a fifth complaint - Dodd/Frank trampled On XX/XX/XXXX a manager in the loss mitigation department, XXXX, told me they did receive the request for modification and she was sending it to the underwriter that day. She told me she would call back either that day or the next. She did neither. I called today, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and another manager named XXXX XXXX just told me that they did not receive the request for modification. Then after I told her that the other manager said they had she back peddaled, didn't explain, and just started acting like they had received the request for modification. 

Iand a sixth complaint Dodd/Frank trampled n the past I've asked your group to hold Bank of America accountable, and thankfully, you did reach out to them. Unfortunately, they respond by completely ignoring my actual concerns. So, this complaint is also about that fact. I am asking you to force them to address my actual concerns both from previous complaints and from this one. 

Again, I ask for help. Bank of America is trying to sell my home out from underneath me. I can't afford a lawyer, and legal aid has the opinion that I shouldn't be trying to save my home but let it go. I refuse to let Bank of America commit fraud against me and steal my home. Please. Please help me. 

I have physical proof of all my complaints. I have recordings of all the times they've trampled Dodd/Frank and the Americans with Disabilities Act. I have proof from their own records, as well. 

As I've said in past complaints, I spend my life educating the children of our country, our future. I volunteer to help those in need and to advocate with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. And prior, I wrote for and helped countless companies deal with their Information Security including work for various US and Washington  State agencies. I also have a son who is volunteering to deploy, a rare thing for XXXX XXXX  XXXX, to a war zone, so he can keep our soldiers safe. In other words, I have spent my life volunteering ( planned and carried out my first major fundraising event when I was XXXX ), helping, and doing what I could to make this world and our country a better place with a future. It's bad enough that I drown in and mostly cope with a serious medical condition, but Bank of America uses my XXXX caused by said condition, XXXX , to manipulate and defraud me. The company that has America in its name is going to sell my home out from underneath me in order to cover up their fraud and abuse. Please stop them. Please be a champion. Please help me. 

Thank you for your time and work."
Mortgage,"Mortgage fraud is multi-billion dollar criminal activities that creates significant negative financial bearing on homeowners, devastates family, hurts communities, can destroy a business and adds a great impact on the national economy. 
Federal, state and local law enforcement officers are on the front lines in the battle to protect their communities from fraud and scams. They identify, investigate and prosecute. 
What is Mortgage Fraud? ( e.g., purchase, refinance, modification ) Act of inducing a loan though means which involve either implied or expressed deceit, i.e. Material misstatement, misrepresentation, or omission of information relied upon by an underwriter or lender to fund, purchase, or insure a loan. It Involves the entire process of obtaining a residential mortgage, including solicitation, application, origination, negotiation of terms, third-party provider services, underwriting, signing and closing, funding of the loan and mortgage loan purchase from a XXXX XXXX XXXX I purchased my home with XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX have now found out that multiple violations occurred from the inception of our loan. In a third audit it was disclosed that multiple variance of TILA has been violated and that MERS was never an entity involved with the loan also that my VA XXXX XXXX was not placed into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX. There were only XXXX assignments out of the XXXX banks involved .We are facing another Foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX and we have not received any assignments since the assignment of BOFA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have had XXXX audits done by XXXX different entities and they each declare FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. The court records have disclosed that XXXX Mortgage XXXX is the now the lender yet we have not received any notification.We have sent over XXXX request from CFPB alone and there was no satisfaction because it feels as if the information was just passed forward .Therefore I will keep pushing forward until Someone READS my concerns from my AUDITS"
Mortgage,"I have always paid my mortgage online and in XXXX 2016, I inadvertently scheduled the payment on the incorrect day. When I realized the problem, I scheduled the correct payment date. 
The following month, I was unable to schedule an online payment, so I simply paid at the local Bank of America branch. I made my mortgage payments at a branch in XXXX and XXXX. 
I received a telephone call from Bank of America in XXXX, alerting me that I have not made the past two payments. I explained that I have the receipts for both payments and that I have the cancelled checks that they were paid by my bank. 
I was informed that I can only use certified payment through XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. After attempting to make a payment through XXXX XXXX, I was unable to do so because the account information provided was invalid. I have no problem making my normal payments, but getting certified funds every month is logistically impossible due to my work schedule and taking care of my elderly parents, as my father has XXXX. 
I would like to return to making online payments."
Mortgage,"I am in foreclosure. The alleged mortgage and note holder is Bank of America N.A . 
I lost my XXXX in 2008 and employment, from which I have not been able to recover. I have pleaded with Bank of America N.A . through hardship letters, in person with their loss mitigation personnel without success."
Mortgage,"My significant other and I applied to and were approved for an FHA Home Mortgage through Bank of America at the end of XX/XX/2019. Throughout the entirety of the process, we have been lied to, misled, and entirely misguided by our banker, our underwriter, and our banker 's manager. Our personal banker ceased communication with us at the end of XX/XX/2019. No questions were answered and our closing date was continuously pushed back. We escalated our issues to the manager and settled on the XXXX of XXXX for a closing date. We both took time off of work for the day, making sure that the manager was well aware of the decision and that he was working to make sure that we had all of the documents. It is currently the end of the day on the XXXX of XXXX and we have been made to resubmit sensitive documents upwards of three times to the underwriter. We have been told different stories by different BoA employees, and the loss of this entire day, the mishandling of our documents, and the lack of communication has left us with very few options for closing dates and will cause us to have to submit another closing addendum to the seller to push back the closing date. This may cause the seller to back out of the deal and tank the entire thing. Please never get your mortgage through Bank of America."
Mortgage,"My ex-husband applied for a loan modification with Bank of America ( BofA ), while we were in divorce proceedings but still legally married, with the hired assistance of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of the now-defunct XXXX company in XXXX XXXX. XXXX and/or XXXX forged my financial information and my signature on the BofA loan modification application WITHOUT my knowledge or consent. Along with the application, a court transcript of a divorce settlement was provided to BofA by XXXX XXXX ( ex-husband ) and/or XXXX representatives who represented to BofA that it was a final divorce judgment, which it WAS NOT. BofA accepted this court transcript as a divorce judgment despite there being no official court filing stamp or documentation to substantiate the paperwork. BofA approved the loan modification based on this falsified information and permitted ONLY XXXX XXXX to sign the loan documents even though my name was on the previous mortgage as well as the new loan modification mortgage. I learned about the loan modification after it was approved. I contacted BofA on several occasions to ask how they could only allow XXXX XXXX 's signature when we were not divorced and since my name was on the loan. They claimed that they "" thought '' they had a divorce judgment ( decree ) in their possession, even though the requisite court filing stamps, etc. were not on any of the divorce settlement documentation they had received. Bank of America was made fully aware after XXXX XXXX secured the loan modification that it was obtained with falsified and erroneous information, and submitted under penalty of perjury. 
Bank of America 's policy of only permitting one signatory on any loan that is held by TWO individuals is a violation of law. Bank of America 's Loan Modification website clearly states, "" All borrowers on your loan agree to participate. '' Bank of America failed to adhere to its own policies. The forgery component is clearly against the law, and BofA 's knowledge of this and unwillingness to take corrective action is reprehensible. It begs the question, 'If BofA believed that we were divorced, and that XXXX XXXX was receiving this [ XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX , CA ] property in the settlement as stated in the XX/XX/XXXX court transcript, then why did n't BofA redraft the loan modification documents to reflect XXXX XXXX "" ownership? ''"
Mortgage,"I have submitted a loan modification application a few times with Bank Of America. I have a past due balance of over {$17000.00} because they will hold your modification or not respond for quite a few months. Then they will deny your request and try to focus on your home. I have filed bankruptcy to keep my home Because of this. We all know that there should never be a past due balance over {$17000.00} without there being something completely wrong. After filing my bankruptcy they have gone up on my regular mortgage payment {$1000.00}. Your reason for filing bankruptcy is to be able to afford your bills, however they are making it impossible for me. I recently Applied for another modification three months ago and have not received a response. I submitted all paperwork requested and have paperwork to prove that it was submitted still no response. I am reaching out to you for help to keep my home and To investigate Bank Of America no modification process and its unfair treatment to mortgage holders. This should be illegal."
Mortgage,Im trying to close and sell my home but Bank of America can not give me a payoff amount. They say it will take 7 days.
Mortgage,"late payments on mortgage XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX we have had a modification that brought us current from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXXtrail period. 
the first payment for our new modification was for XX/XX/XXXX. everything is on time. 
we ask that the old late payments for the other loan, should be removed from the credit, there are no reason these should be on the credit with a modification. please consider the new loan mod. to be moving forward. these late payments are a year old."
Mortgage,"We were part of the Cares Act, resumed payments on XX/XX/XXXX and deferred the prior payments to end of mortgage. However we noted that both our regular XXXX and XXXX payments - though showed as paid were not applied. My husband contacted Bank of America and was told that was a mistake on their part and they would be applied correctly. As of XXXX we showed a XXXX balance due with next payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. Today we received notice of major derogatory on our report. A big shock to us. In contacting Bank of America they said it was a software mistake and our payments had been routed elsewhere?!? The woman seemed horrified and apologetic but the manager that needed to address was out for the day. She said they would send letters for our credit cards. But didnt know how long this would take to address. This isnt good enough. Once before when this bank made an escrow mistake they sent letters but it was too late - credit card usage had been disrupted and it was not restored for months. This needs to be addressed immediately. Managers being away and this being routed through their regular routing process is not enough. If my credit is impacted I deserve compensation from this bank. This bank should not be sending ANYTHING to credit right now if they have this many issues with new software and working from home."
Mortgage,iI have a mortage with Bank of America for 30 years fixed. I made extra payment to payoff the mortage but the money is held in an escro account. I made several attempts to resolve the problem but noone pays attention.
Mortgage,"I fell behind on my mortgage XX/XX/2009. I spoke with my lender, Bank of America and they instructed me to send {$1400.00} overnight to prevent foreclosure, which I did. I was told that this would bring me up to date and that they would respond with the next steps to take. Two months later they sent the money back and told me that it was a miscommunication and that they were going to foreclose anyway. I made attempts over the next 3 years to work with Bank of America but they refused to take any payments stating they would only accept the full balance, or they would proceed with the foreclose. 
Eventually I beat them back in court in the XXXX Judicial Circuit of Illinois and forced them to modify the loan. A {$2000.00} settlement payment followed from Bank of America to compensate me for the improper foreclosure effort. 
As a result of the improper foreclosure Bank of America has placed over 38 late / missing payment notations on my credit report, even though they would not accept payments during that period. Additionally, it was agreed during the loan modification that Bank of America would remove the late / missed payment notations. It was agreed that I could n't have been late or missed payments that the lender refused to accept. They now have simply forgotten that part of the agreement. 
I have attempted to speak with Bank of America regarding this complaint, but there is no one who is willing to address the modification, or even discuss the mis-reporting. This is having a huge affect on my credit score and my ability to refinance to get a lower interest rate. It has cost me thousands of dollars in high interest rates with other lenders as well."

Mortgage,"Bank of America , N.A . ( BOA ) made a mockery of both federal and state property protection laws and violated the terms of the settlement provisions with the Department of Justice by engaging in a pattern and practice of egregious mortgage fraud, fraudulent document manufacturing, coercion and intimidation and, ultimately, wrongfule foreclosure on my Texas home. A title audit revealed, after I executed a tangible FHA-insured UCC Article 3 Note with XXXX ( XXXX ) for {$100000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX sold my Note to XXXX XXXX pursuant to Special Purpose Vehicle ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Offering Circular Supplement dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ). Neither XXXX XXXX or the Trust re-contracted with me, the Legal Title Holder, to create a new security instrument in accordance to local law of jurisdiction which would have secured XXXX XXXX beneficial interest and alternate means of collection to under my Deed of Trust ( DOT ) before the XXXX XXXX, XXXX was the cut-off date for the Trust. Instead, XXXX XXXX created an UCC Article 8 eNote pursuant to V.T.C.A. B & C 8.102 but there is no record that the UCC Article 3 of my note unequivocally was not sold or conveyed and there is no record of the transaction/assignment of interest in my DOT recorded or filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as required by federal, SEC, or Texas property laws. Notwithstanding, XXXX XXXX entered into a Pooling and Servicing agreement with Countrywide Home Loans and Bank of America , N.A . ( as successor ) claiming enforcement rights under my DOT but still failed to make an assignment of these rights before the Trust cut-off date. When I fell behind in my mortgage payments after a business deal went bad in XXXX XXXX, I attempted to recover financially under Chapter XXXX bankruptcy protections several times. In XXXX, XXXX, I requested a HAMP loan modification. BOA informed me my modification had been approved but did not send the documents in "" a few weeks '' as promised. Between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I repeatedly contacted BOA requesting the status report on my loan modification. On XXXX, XXXX, I received a Notice of Substitute Sale from BOA by certified mail informing me my home would be sold at auction on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. County records reveal on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX purports to have assigned enforcement rights under my DOT to BOA ( the XXXX assignment ever recorded for my DOT ) over XXXX years after XXXX sold my note to the Trust and the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Trust cut-off date. The assignment was executed by XXXX XXXX, a robo-signer. Despite request from myself and my lawyers for BOA to validate their collection and enforcement rights, BOA continued foreclosure attempts. I filed a title slander and mortgage fraud complaint against BOA to stop the foreclosure in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the judge 's ordered BOA to appear at a hearing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to discuss BOA 's purported DOT enforcement rights. BOA did not appear at the hearing and I later learned BOA had sold my home to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The sale violated the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act ( PTFA ) because the title transfer was effected only XXXX days after notice and while the FHA Regional Office was still considering my "" bono fide tenant '' request. ( FHA guidelines dictate the transfer can not effected until XXXX days after notice and the FHA 's final decision concerning my PTFA request ). XXXX immediately began the eviction process and XXXX XXXX courts issued a possession judgment in their favor on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I was forcibly evicted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX under a XXXX days old in violation of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 510.8 which states writs older than XXXX days are unenforceable and Rule 520.9 which states default adverse actions can not be taken while a case if pending before the Texas XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am now XXXX and damaged."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2021, I submitted my home mortgage refinancing application to Bank of America mortgage ( BOFA ) and on XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX, BOFA lending officer collected a deposit of {$120.00} from me ( please see attached ) for Desktop appraisal fee ( {$93.00} ) and other charges ( {$31.00} ). Per my conversation with XXXX XXXX at the time of my application, he told me that BOFA would match the other banks mortgage refinancing offer that I already received ( interest rate and other closing costs which I provided XXXX XXXX with a copy of the other banks offer ) and XXXXXXXX XXXX further stated that if I withdrew my application going forward, I would be entitled to get a refund for my {$120.00} that I paid to BOFA. Per XXXXXXXX XXXX instructions, I started submitting all the required documents for loan processing and eventually my refinancing loan was approved for 15-year mortgage with a low interest rate. I requested XXXX XXXX to send me a draft closing disclosure which he did and upon reviewing the closing disclosure, I found out BOFA did not match other banks refinancing offer entirely that they promised to do. The following week, XXXXXXXX XXXX  called me and told me that I did not need a standard ( visual inspection ) home appraisal for my property instead BOFA would use its online Home Appraisal tool to assess my property value. However, the next day he informed me that he was mistaken and I did require a home appraisal. He told me that a home appraisal company was going to contact me and my response was affirmative. 
While I was getting ready for my home appraisal, XXXXXXXX XXXX  sent me an email and asked me to address and state in writing certain concerns that BOFA under writer had regarding some payments that I made from my bank account such as college tuition payments and Macys payments. I addressed their concerns i.e. I have zero student loan and I am not a co-signer of any student loan etc. and provided BOFA with a statement document of my wifes XXXX account. Then they asked for my recent bank statement which I did send them too. Based on my recent bank statement that I provided them with, I have had more than enough money saved for my mortgage refinancing purposes than BOFA required. The following week they asked for more bank statements to be sent to them but I expressed my concerns for that due to privacy issues. I started realizing that since the mortgage interest rate started jumping dramatically higher for the last few weeks, BOFA was looking for an excuse/reason to deny my mortgage refinancing application. My XXXX score is over 820 and I have an impeccable credit history. My current mortgage is with Bank of America too ( last 15 years ) and I have never missed a payment or made a late payment. BOFA checked my credit history, income and employment thoroughly and found zero issues, yet BOFA was dragging my refinancing loan application final approval process only to look for a way to get out of it because of recent industry interest rate increase. With no end in sight for a resolution, I decided to withdraw my application and requested XXXX XXXX for a full refund of my deposit but BOFA only refunded partially ( {$19.00} ) out of {$120.00} and still owes me {$100.00}. 
Under the above circumstances, I, therefore, request CFPB to help me get my entire deposit money ( {$120.00} ) back. I need to be compensated by BOFA for my financial loss because I have had many opportunities to refinance my mortgage with other banks with even a lower interest rate. Additionally, actions should be taken against BOFA so that other applicants do not have to go through the same painful experience."
Mortgage,"XXXX ( XXXX ) was hired by Bank of America ( BOA ) to secure the property located at, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD XXXX after a tree fell on the home on XXXX. Safeguard states they placed a lock box on the house on XX/XX/XXXX, the homeowner called to inquire about the XXXX 's role was on XX/XX/XXXX due to noticing changed locks, a lock box on the house and being unable to access the property. The homeowner 's were given a code to the lock box to access the home, that did not work. The homeowner 's had not abandoned or nor had BOA foreclosed on the property as XXXX has stated on numerous occasions, rather the house was deemed uninhabitable by both the State and County governments. 
Since XXXX has become involved with the property there have been numerous issues. Their refusal to listen to the homeowner 's requests, their repeated attempts to gain entry to the property, the various "" repairs '' performed by their contractors and the theft of various. The homeowners have been in ongoing discussions with homeowners insurance company, as well as the BOA, placed insurance company filing the necessary claims for the damages to the home in hopes of having the repairs so that they could live in the home again The contractors hired by XXXX jeopardized all insurance claims by making "" repairs '' to the home. Their "" repairs '' hid the damages from the insurance inspectors and adjusters. This made it impossible for the homeowners to show the insurance company the true extent of the damages, skewing the estimate and hindering the adjuster 's ability to identify what true repairs were needed to make the property and homeowners whole again. The "" repairs '' completed by XXXX 's contractors minimized the nature of the homeowner 's claims and severely minimized the value of the damages. 
The most detrimental occurrence was in XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX hired a company out of Minnesota, XXXX ( XXXX ), to make repairs to the home in order to secure the property and make it uninhabitable. Because XXXX was based out of Minnesota they contracted out to a local companydoing business as, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). The homeowners are not sure what repairs XXXX were asked to perform because several requests for a copy of the work order have been ignored. 
The work that was requested was either not done or done incorrectly. The photos provided to show completion of work are incomplete or very minimal and only show a small portion of the home, in order to give the appearance that the work had been completed. 
The homeowners have filed insurance claims against XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. but they were denied by the company as it does not cover inadequate repairs or negligent work. The liability claim filed by the homeowners was declined because there was not contract between the homeowners and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The homeowners filed a better business complaint in hopes to come to a resolution on the damages and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX has made several slanderous accusations against the homeowners in order to prove their innocence in these matters. They have said the home had been repossessed, that it was under foreclosure and that the homeowners we suit happy just trying to get a "" free meal ''. 
The homeowners contacted XXXX on several occasions and informed them that they were in talks with the insurance companies and requested that XXXX stay off the property. XXXX was notified on several occasions that the property was not abandoned but rather could not be lived in due to the extent of the damages. The homeowners filed a legal claim with XXXX in regards to the damages caused by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and their cosmetic repairs, XXXX response was they only did what Bank of America told them to do and that the photos provided prove the work was done right."
Mortgage,"My name is XXXX, and I have been working with Bank of America 's home loan team for the past few months regarding a refinancing of the home loan for my second residence down in XXXX, FL. 

My loan application was rejected by BOA on XX/XX/2016 due to the % the of investors in the complex being above some predetermined threshold set by some agency. 
My frustration in this whole process is three-fold : 1 ) At no point during the home loan process was this ever identified as a potential risk. I would think that the loan originator ( XXXX ) or someone in loan processing ( XXXX/XXXX ) has done a cash out refi on a multi-family dwelling, and they would know that this was a potential issue. 
2 ) My closing date was pushed back 3 times and I was informed of the rejection the day before my 3rd closing date. This has left me absolutely scrambling as I am now having to start this whole process again nearly 3 months into it. 
3 ) When I was informed of the decision, no one from BOA advised me as to alternative solutions nor what the next steps are from here. XXXX provided me with the bad news, and she committed to connecting with me that week to discuss if there were any other options available to me. I have left dozens of emails + Voicemails with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX since XX/XX/2016, and none of those individuals nor anyone from their team has responded back to me. 

I have been a very loyal BOA customer for over 15 years, and I have never had such a negative experience with this organization as I have had during this process. I have spent nearly {$1000.00} on appraisals and fees with nothing to show for it. 

I financially support my XXXX mother, and the money from this loan has been earmarked for her medical expenses. We are now having to delay appointments and treatments until I figure out a financing option ... .all of this occurring during the holidays. 

It is equally maddening that BOA states that customer service is a priority, and all of these individuals ' voicemail indicate that they will return the call within one business day."
Mortgage,"XXXX - took out a primary loan as well as a "" soft second '' with Bank of America to purchase a primary/only residence Between XXXX and XXXX mortgage payments became difficult to impossible to make due to difficulties with the mother of my children. My options were either leave myself or evict my children and their mother. I could not afford rent as well as the mortgage nor could I evict my own children. 

XXXX - struggled to make payments on the "" soft second '' ( as well as the primary ) XXXX - made a payment "" soft second '' after missing several payments XXXX - Bank of America "" charged off '' the "" soft second '' loan XXXX - the last tax document issued with respect to the "" soft second '' was submitted to the IRS was for the XXXX tax year Prior to foreclosure, the primary loan changed servicers to "" XXXX '', who did get in contact with me regarding foreclosure mitigation. 
No contact was made regarding the soft second, which I was unaware was charged off. At the time, I thought that loan was lumped in with the primary loan re : who was servicing the loan and handling the eventual foreclosure. I had no reason to think otherwise, given the situation and that both loans originated with the same company. 

XXXX - foreclosure XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - foreclosure complete, with the transaction amount being over {$2000.00} more than the amount owed on the primary loan and about {$10000.00} less than the market value noted on the 1099-A. 
There is no record of any of the excess being applied to the "" soft second '' loan, which had been charged off two years prior.

2023 January- the charged off "" soft second '' changes servicers from Bank of America itself to Capital Management Services I was not notified of this change. In addition to not notifying me of this change, Bank of America gave the new servicer a contact address that I have no association with ( the address is for a strip mall in a town where I have never lived ) despite Bank of America having sent correspondence to where I lived in XXXX, which is in the same building where I currently reside ( just across the hall from the last address -- it is a 3-unit home ). 

Right around this time, I was in the process of trying to secure a pre-approval for a loan to purchase a home with my wife ( in no small part as means to improve my children 's custody situation ). We went through "" hard '' credit checks, and so on. 
Because of debt on my wife 's side of things, we have to pause our search to improve our DTI ratio and the issue with my loan remains hidden. 

XXXX - I still am unaware of the change in services for the "" soft second '' ( or that it still exists as I thought it went with the foreclosure ). The discrepancies are found when we go to apply for pre-approval after improving the DTI ratio and my wife receiving a promotion. 
Traversing the Bank of America phone system to try to find out what happened to this secondary loan is almost impossible because the account number is not recognized by their phone system nor is my SSN. 
Bank of America Collections has some record of the account, but only that it has been sent to a new servicer. They seem certain that it was some kind of loan taken out for home repairs or the like as they can not figure out why I would think that it would be associated with the foreclosure, even though it was taken out to purchase the home along with another Bank of America loan. 
When asked for the note, etc., associate with the loans as well as a copy of the agreement ( s ) sign, they are unable/unwilling to provide any information. They say they will send the payment history. They told me that the collections had been sent to an outside servicer and provided the number. 
I called the new servicer and found that Bank of America had provided them with the incorrect address. I requested the send me information regarding this debt. I received a notice/bill, but no information regarding how the service was transferred, etc. I have subsequently requested any and all information they may have on this debt. 

Somewhere in all of this, Bank of America neglected to ethically handle the "" soft second '' both by charging it off without notice, despite a recent payment, as well as not applying any excess in the sale to the second mortgage and not getting fair market value for the house to absolve the majority of the soft second along with the primary loan. They also neglected to provide the new servicers information to me and provided that servicer an incorrect address such that I was unaware that the debt had changed hands."
Mortgage,"Our firm, XXXX has been monitoring our client 's request for mortgage assistance to Bank of America to ensure its compliance with Regulation X. For the past few months, our client has been trying to get her application reviewed by Bank of America however, Bank of America has failed to act diligently and now our client faces a serious concern of losing her home. The borrower submitted a Loss Mitigation Application to Bank of America on XX/XX/2016 via facsimile transmission. We emailed an exact copy to Bank of America 's counsel at XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) on XXXX after discovering XXXX specifically requested the borrower direct any and all loss mitigation communication to their office only and not to send anything directly to the bank. An attorney at XXXX confirmed with our firm the borrower 's Application was submitted to Bank of America for review. Subsequently, XXXX requested additional documents from the borrower needed to complete the review of her Application. All of the requested documents listed in XXXX letter were submitted to XXXX by the stated deadline via e-mail and certified mail on XX/XX/2016. Pursuant to a letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/2016, there was no foreclosure sale scheduled as of the letter date according to Bank of America. 

After receiving a separate letter from Bank of America regarding the documents needed for the modification review, we sent an email to XXXX to confirm the list of items we received from their office on XX/XX/XXXX was up to date and an accurate list of all that was needed for the review. XXXX confirmed via email that the list they sent us was correct and advised that the documents we submitted to them on XX/XX/XXXX were being reviewed by Bank of America and they would advise if anything further was needed. Nothing further was ever requested by XXXX or Bank of America after we submitted the additional documents on XX/XX/XXXX. The borrower never received any notification or information pertaining to the results of her loss mitigation review. Despite the foregoing, our client was notified there is now a foreclosure sale date scheduled for her home. We believe this is clear violation of the prohibition against dual tracking pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ). 

Additionally, we received a letter from Bank of America a few days ago alleging it never received a complete application from the borrower. We believe this to be an inaccurate statement and error given the aforementioned chain of events and communication between our office and the attorneys at XXXX. At no point after the borrower submitted the requested documents to XXXX as instructed on XX/XX/XXXX did Bank of America or XXXX request additional items or inform the borrower that her application remained incomplete. Pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 1024.41, Bank of America is required to diligently review applications and promptly request additional documents when necessary."
Mortgage,"See complaint XXXX. 

Subsequent to "" resolution '' ( which is an erroneous interpretation ) BoA committed to returning my payments to not include an escrow for taxes and insurance. On XX/XX/XXXX they debited my bank account the mortgage payment AND taxes and insurance. They immediately admitted their mistake and promised to refund my payment. Instead of crediting my account or wiring me funds, they sent me a check one week later. The check was over {$500.00} less than the amount they committed and old me that they would refund."

My brother had a loan with them for about ten years payment XXXX mo. he paid every month XXXX towards loan. Contacting B of A. in XXXX of XXXX to redo his mortgage with a payment of XXXX.

There was so much pressure on my brother that XX/XX/XXXX he gave up stopped his meds and then passed on the XXXX of XXXX XXXX. 
***** The rest of the information and finishing giving you all the important fact is continued on a PDF I have included along with lots of info from these companies and attorney. I did this as per speaking to your office earlier today."
Mortgage,"This is regarding case # XXXX. I have tried to dispute Bank of Americas answer but the system wo n't let me submit my response. 
I have had it with this company! My bank statements clearly show that I have paid my mortgage every month on time! XXXX was paid! We were instructed by our account rep. XXXX XXXX in the XXXX time frame that we were approved for a trial modification and our first payment would be XX/XX/2015. We completed this modification and this did not change my interest rate in any way! A giant waste of time! We were told that our account was now current and in good standing! 
Last week I was denied a refinance at my bank! The mortgage officer showed me a print out of my credit report that showed BOA listed me as delinquent for XXXX, 2015. This was our trial mod. period. This is another demonstration of how BOA holds their customers hostage in such a way that one can never escape and is forced to stay in their high interest mortgages. These tactics are well documented in past court litigations. 
I paid this months mortgage on XXXX XXXX before the grace period due to an out of town commitment, I 'll bet that shows up as late or I get a fee attached. This has been going on for several years now. All attempts to refinance have been delayed, lost documents, switched account reps and a number of other excuses to keep my family anchored to their high interest mortgage and incompetent service! If something is not done I will have no alternative but to obtain a lawyer a file suit. The damage this has done to my family is cruel and unjust!!! 
I want BOA to CLEAR MY CREDIT REPORT AND PROVIDE A DOCUMENT EXPLAINING THIS SO I CAN REFINANCE ELSEWHERE!!!!! Also BOA attached {$1800.00} to my principal saying it was overdue interest. INTEREST ON WHAT? Itemize and explain this fee! overdue interest tells me nothing!!! They have the power to contact me and inform me of any issues, but choose not to. This is how they operate and imprison their customers. 
I WANT OUT NOW!!!! BOA resolve this and let my family go!!!!!"
Mortgage,"I called Bank of America ( BOA ) to have my PMI dropped on XX/XX/XXXX. They told me my PMI would automatically drop when I was below 80 % LTV. My account is auto drafted. I have never missed a payment. I have financed 4 homes via BOA. ( NEVER AGAIN ) I opened a paper statement in XX/XX/XXXX, flipped the bill over, and notice I am STILL being charged PMI. I call XX/XX/XXXX to ask why. BOA tells me I have to pay {$520.00} for a re-appraisal. I tell BOA, per the Home Owner Protection act, my PMI should have been removed in ~XX/XX/XXXX. BOA tells me the ONLY way to get my PMI dropped is to have the appraisal. I send in {$520.00} for the appraisal. BOA mails me a {$520.00} back and says I do not need an appraisal. They drop my PMI. I would like to recoup the ~ {$1700.00} that BOA charged me in PMI payments that I did not owe from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX at {$92.00} per month. The Homeowner Protection Act is in place because customers have NOTORIOUSLY had difficultly getting their PMI dropped. After trying to work with BOA on Request ID XXXX and Case XXXX, I am reaching out to the CFPB for assistance in recovering payments that I did not owe BOA."
Mortgage,"I overpaid the FHA MIP, and I am having a hard time getting the amount of money I overpaid refunded to me."
Mortgage,"Ive contacted Bank of America, who has taken zero action or authority and changes their story as to why the next step has not happened. They refuse to proceed with a foreclosure on a vacant, legally abandoned home since XXXX, cancelled a scheduled foreclosure for XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. My loan is now 11 years old and I owe 56 percent more then its original principal because they have dragged there feet and hid behind the covid moratorium that does not apply given the property is both vacant and abandoned. Please help as the only one that is benefiting from this is Bank of America and it is not right."
Mortgage,"ReconTrust ( Headquartered in XXXX XXXX, CA, ReconTrust is a member of the Bank of America family of companies. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX ) was a debt collector foreclosing on my home and by the time we were able to get this stopped they had added about {$20000.00} to the balance of my loan without providing comprehensive itemization for the sum provided in the loan modification "" ReconTrust is a foreclosure trustee that is legally required to act as a neutral party on behalf of both the lender and the borrower while conducting foreclosure proceedings in good faith and in accordance with the law. '' XXXX XXXX   XXXX However, Recon Trust refused to respond to our communications, refused to acknowledge funds paid and instead stated that we had not paid though we had documentation to prove otherwise.

Recontrust violated : 15 U.S.C. 1692f. Unfair practices A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 6 ) Taking or threatening to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property if -- ( A ) there is no present right to possession of the property claimed as collateral through an enforceable security interest ; ( B ) there is no present intention to take possession of the property ; or ( C ) the property is exempt by law from such dispossession or disablement.

ReconTrust subsequently had sent us notice of Trustees Sale noting that unless we cured the balance due it would be sold at public auction and at the local court house the auction was posted on the public bulletin board. The unpaid balance was different than the balance that we believed due by about {$20000.00} in charges that were not itemized.

ReconTrust also stated in the notice that it was a debt collector attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained would be used to collect the debt. The notices sent to us by ReconTrust contained misleading information regarding the amount due and alleged owed.

The unitemized summary balance was used to modify the loan raising the balance approx. $ 22-24,000 higher than the balance we understood due and owing at the time. 
But we could not get anyone to talk to us. Even a local realtor volunteered to assist us in calling them on our behalf but could get no response. 
ReconTrust was listed as a Trustee but acted only as a debt collector and refused to respond to my calls, thereby assisting BAC in what I have continue to believe was fraud regarding the issue of the additional amounts added to my original loan amount."
Mortgage,"BOA will be abbreviation for Bank of America. 
Please find the sequence of events and our horrible experience with BOA. 
) The XXXX loan officer was told about this property with a request to immediately find out if the condo approval can be an issue. The information about the condo management was sent to XXXX Loan officer on XXXX XXXX. I requested to send the condo questionnaire as soon as possible on XXXX XXXX. 
1 ) The rate lock with Bank was issued on XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. 
2 ) The lease of our present apartment was sent to Loan Officer on XX/XX/XXXX. Loan officer was so confident that he advised us that we should give the notice to the apartment ( 2 months ' notice + 2 month rent as buy out fee or lease breakage fee of around {$5300.00} ). 
3 ) we however still waited till XXXX XXXX to give the notice which basically terminated our lease on XXXX XXXX, 2015 along with buyout fee of {$5300.00}. 
4 ) Somewhere between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Loan officer left the bank and we came to know about this only on XXXX XXXX. It was only when we sent bank the email asking what is happening that they got back to us stating that the XXXX loan officer has left. Bank was so unprofessional that for 10 days it did not transact any business knowing fully that the client had the mortgage contingency day of XX/XX/XXXX.we had signed the agreement on XXXX XXXX. 
5 ) On XXXX XXXX, 2015 that the bank stated that they are working on condo approval. 
6 ) On XXXX XXXX, BOA sent an email stating that there was a problem in the way the loan was initiated in the beginning. The bank started putting the burden for their inefficiency on the XXXX loan officer who has left the bank. They admitted that there was a problem in the way the loan got originated. 
7 ) Finally around XX/XX/XXXX BOA denied the loan stating that the condo did not put XXXX % in the reserve. 
8 ) we got in touch with XXXX XXXX in XXXX, CT around XX/XX/2015 and within 7 days they got back to us and stated that the property is not XXXX approved since they have not been putting XXXX % of the condo fee into the reserve as required by XXXX guidelines. Our attorney advised that the property could have resale value problem and so we cancelled the purchase. 
9 ) It is a matter of great disappointment that BOA took around 60 days ( XXXX Loan Officer was told about this property on XXXX XXXX ) to evaluate the facts whereas XXXX XXXX presented us a very good picture within 7 days so that we can take an informed decision. Beside lots of inconvenience, the delay by BOA costs us loss of money and time. The buyout fee for Lease breakage was provided on XXXX XXXX and the bank had ample time to come back to us and state that the property is not XXXX approved so that we could have not broken the lease and unnecessarily incurred the buyout fee for {$5300.00}. 
10 ) Because of the banks inefficiency and lack of regard for their consumer we suffered financial loss of {$6800.00}. The bank only reimbursed for the appraisal cost of {$460.00} in spite of repeated requests. BOA should reimburse us the remaining {$6400.00}. 
12 ) It is interesting to know that the condo questionnaire was returned by the association within 3 days which clearly stated the reserve account problem however the bank did not notify us anything about it. The bank should have notified about the condo reserve issue as soon as they got the questionnaire. Instead of initiating the condo questionnaire around XXXX XXXX the bank waited 10 days since the XXXX loan officer has left and there was no concern with the bank that they have a client who is left clueless. The condo questionnaire was initiated on XXXX XXXX and the completed questionnaire was received within 3 days ( XXXX XXXX ). Even then it is astonishing that why the bank did not notify us about this issue XX/XX/XXXX rather than making us go through an agonizing wait."
Mortgage,my mother past away several months ago and her apartment was willed to me. After numerous attempts to resolve the transfer of mortgage to my name and a complaint being filed with this bureau. Bank of america had not reached out to me to state that the problem was resolved. I submitted the paperwork that XXXX XXXX told me to submit. After numerous attempts to contact Ms XXXX to see if paperwork was submitted properly I received no call back or any written corespondence. I was advised I had 60 days to submit the paperwork.After staying on hold for hours in order to reach someone at Bank of America no one was able to help me. Ms XXXX was left several voice mail that she never responded to.I am seeking to finally resolve this issue to have the mortgage transferred to my name which is legal right.
Mortgage,"This is the second complaint against Bank of America that we've left on this site. The first one was closed without many issues being addressed, especially the poor communication. The bank provided a contact name and number that didn't work in their response to the last complaint. We've NEVER been able to reach a representative at the number provided by the bank it's always voicemail. The coronavirus pandemic has made a bad situation worse and it's nearly impossible to get someone on the phone and written correspondence sent via mail takes weeks to reach us. The date on letters is always more than 10 days passed by the time we get it. We put our home on the market for sale in XX/XX/2019 but had no buyer interest due to deferred maintenance and possible structural damage to the house. We recently received a cash offer on our home well under the asking price, after two previous offers fell through because buyers backed out because of length of time for processing and lack of response from the bank. Our agent, who is experienced in short sales, has been working diligently to ensure that this one gets further along than the other two failed attempts. After having the house on the market for nearly a year, we are out of options and need to either do a short sale or let the home go to foreclosure. We felt as though progress was being made when our agent was alerted that our loan is set to be service released to XXXX Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX but she was told the bank can't actually confirm that until XX/XX/XXXX when it would show in the system. Our agent learned of this from Bank of America 2 days prior to XX/XX/XXXX, even though the letter we were told we should have received from Bank of America was dated XX/XX/XXXX. We have never received such a letter from the bank nor have we received any communication from XXXX. Our loan disclosures say that we should have received communication about this type of transaction more than 30 days prior to the servicing being released. Now, we don't know what will happen. In the past, we were told that we couldn't attempt a short sale without first being considered for a loan modification since the home is our primary residence. That was time consuming and futile since we still couldn't afford the lower payment. We continue to experience an extreme financial hardship due to the pandemic. Will the process need to be started over with XXXX? Will we be considered for a short sale or have to go through the loan modification process again? Who can provide us the answers we need and actually answer the phone when we call?"
Mortgage,"My wife and I applied for a HELOC on XX/XX/XXXX. Credit score XXXX, XXXX year Bank of America customers with multiple accounts, never a late payment on any accounts. Credit card balances paid in full every month. Only debit is a car loan with a balance of {$19000.00} on a XXXX XXXX appraised at {$36000.00}. 

We have 100 % equity in our home ( no mortgage ). Applied for a HELOC of 14.3 % of Bank of America 's own appraised value. The process was awful. Multiple requests for the same documents. The XXXX processor XXXX XXXX failed to return e-Mails and more often than not did not call with updates as he promised. I wasted many hours chasing him down. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received an approval letter. The closing was scheduled. Then Bank of America rescinded the approval. My wife lost her job after the application date of XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America did not bother to check her employment until after the approval. My wife and I are now both retired. We live off savings and will shortly draw minimal amounts from our IRAs. My wife also started her pension. Bank of America refused to consider those sources of income. 

A couple days later I received a customer satisfaction survey which I promptly filled out expressing my dissatisfaction with the process. The next morning I received a call from a Bank of America representative asking for more detail about my complaint. I explained about our sources of income and she agreed that they should have been considered and that she would see to it that the process was re-started and expedited. We agreed. 

Was contacted by XXXX XXXX and asked for more detail on our savings, pension, and IRA accounts which was provided the same day. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX saying that the package was going to underwriting. That was the last unprompted call received despite a promise of weekly updates. 

I called XXXX XXXX several times over the next few weeks and got either a busy signal or voice mail. Calls were not returned. I left voice mails for his supervisors XXXX XXXX and later XXXX XXXX asking for callbacks and never received XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX did reach me in late XXXX / early XXXX to ask for permission to run an additional credit report. I gave permission and asked to be notified when the report was run so that I could lock my three credit bureau accounts again. I was never notified. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a copy of the second appraisal performed by Bank of America. This appraisal was for {$23000.00} more than the original appraisal. Our requested HELOC amount was now 13.4 % of appraised value. 

I manage to reach XXXX XXXX on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about status and the credit report. He told me that the package still had not gone to underwriting but that the credit report had been. About 15 minutes after the end of that conversation I received a notice from XXXX that my credit had just been run by Bank of America. So I was lied to. XXXX XXXX also promised to call me by end of day on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX with an update. I had not heard from him at XXXX on that date so I called him. Went straight to voice mail and I never heard from him. 

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Bank of America stating our loan had been denied due to too much debt. The call came from someone not familiar with loan - not XXXX XXXX. I explained to the person my dissatisfaction and gave her the facts. She took notes and promised that I would receive a call back from XXXX XXXX and his supervisor in 24 to 48 hours. As of XX/XX/XXXX I have received no call."
Mortgage,"I am filing a complaint against Bank of America for its improper, undisciplined and reckless handling of our home mortgage closing in XXXX, XXXX. Below is a description of what happened. 
- My husband XXXX and I were pre-approved for the mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX ( pre-approval letter attached ). We requested to close on XX/XX/XXXX. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX contacted Bank of America to move forward on the mortgage process, since we had not heard from them on next steps. ( XX/XX/XXXX email attached ) - All correspondence with Bank of America regarding the loan was done through a secure email service, and the messages are deleted by the bank after 1 week, so we don't have all of the correspondence with the Bank between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. To summarize, XXXX and I provided our requested documentation in late XXXX and early XXXX. We heard little from the bank during this time. As we neared closing, we received additional requests for obscure documents that had not been requested previously. 
- XXXX requested a call with our loan officer, XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, as we had not received any notification from Bank of America that let us know if the loan was closed or not, and the data on the online loan processing portal was out of date. XXXX told us that we had provided all of our documentation, but the Bank had some outstanding paperwork to complete. He was not concerned about missing the closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, we began getting calls from our title company and real estate agent, asking what was happening with the closing paperwork. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM, our real estate agent received an email from Bank of America requesting additional updates to documentation! ( Attached email for XXXX and XXXX correspondence with the real estate agent provides details. ) All requests to provide signatures on documents were incorrect - Bank of America already had the signed documents. In some cases, we had provided the signed documents multiple times. 
- In the end, B of A said we could not close because the XXXX addendums to the purchase agreement ( created by their request ) were numbered incorrectly. Instead of being numbered Addendums 1, 2 and 3, two of the addendums were numbered with the same number. B of A required the real estate agent to correct the numbering and have XXXX, me and the seller initial the changes via XXXX before we could close. Addendums with updated numbering were sent to the bank late on XXXX,, and we completed the XXXX process the morning of XXXX. The request was ridiculous and last minute. 
- Meanwhile, I spent over an hour trying to contact Bank of America the evening of XX/XX/XXXX trying to get a status on our closing. After escalating to a supervisor, someone from B of A called us and said we were cleared to close. The next day, we learned that was not the case. 
- An email describing the problems still open between Bank of America at XXXX AM the day of our closing is attached. At that point, the title company still had not received closing paperwork from the bank and was having difficulty even reaching a contact at Bank of America. 
- Closing documentation was finally provided mid-afternoon. It was inaccurate and had to be corrected. 
- The final loan amount was provided at XXXX PM. We wired the money to the title company, but it did not clear until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, due to Bank of America 's latency in providing the figure. 
- At that point, I had to find an available mobile notary and pay for the service so the loan documents could be signed at our home. This was extremely distressing. Given the limited time, we did not finish printing and signing the documents until XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We had to drop the documents at XXXX by XXXX PM to complete the closing on XX/XX/XXXX, or the loan would have had to be re-done. We completed the drop off at XXXX at XXXX PM. Needless to say, Bank of America put us through a tremendous amount of turmoil."
Mortgage,"We paid off our mortgage with Bank of America in 2013 and have yet to receive our home title. We have asked multiple times for our title and have been transferred to at least XXXX different people who are "" working on our case, '' they have opened at least XXXX cases for us, but there has been no resolution and no response from anyone at Bank of America letting us know the status of our case. We try to contact them via the email and phone numbers they have given us, but they do not answer. We have had our attorney contact Bank of America and they basically denied any wrongdoing ; they claimed that this was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX and a missing assignment. It is not our fault if BOFA sold our loan to a third party or lost it. It has been over two years since we have paid off our loan and Nevada state law requires the owner to receive their title within 90 days of being paid off. We are worried we will never receive it."
Mortgage,Settlement conference hearing at courthouse with Bank of America XX/XX/2019. They gave me a year to sell the house on my own after obtaining a realtor and following other steps which the year wouldve started end of XX/XX/2019 beginning of XX/XX/2019 because I had to fight to get the steps accomplished getting the paperwork in when they would say they didnt receive it & set it for sheriff sale saying I didnt comply. Then they would see that I did and stop it. This happened a handful of times. I complied as best as I could and everything was on time. I did everything they asked me to do and they dont want to hold up to their end of it.
Mortgage,"I was in mediation with Bank of America, already filed that complaint. Bank of America charged me {$200.00} and now an additional {$530.00} because for ten minutes of them telling me they would not help me or correct the records. They prey on the old and XXXX!"
Mortgage,"In early XXXX, I applied for a mortgage refinancing through Bank of America Home Loans. On XXXX XXXX, I paid {$680.00} for a home appraisal and immediately gave access to the appraiser. However, the appraisal was not completed within the 60-day rate lock period, despite repeated inquiries and attempts to move the process to completion. I e-mailed the loan originators, their supervisor, and Bank of America Quality Assurance, without any resolution, specifically writing on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX -- the last two after the rate lock had expired. On XXXX, I asked for a refund of the {$680.00} I 'd paid for services I did n't receive, but heard nothing ; I wrote again on XXXX to restate my request for a refund -- and again, Bank of America ignored my correspondence. In short, Bank of America scammed me by collecting fees for services they failed to provide inside their own timeline ; they failed the customer service test by ignoring my repeated requests for a refund."
Mortgage,"I have paid out XXXX to an attorney to help me save my home. It did not happen. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and Bank of America have all had their hands on this house at XXXX point or another. I have been told to convert the chapter XXXX to a XXXX and give up my home. I am XXXX and so is my mom. I have a XXXX in my home for over 30 years. But nobody cares. All they want is to get their hands on the PMI insurance I have on the house and they get to sell the house to They have not offered me any kind of money to help me relocate Nothing. And this is the American way. All I can say is that I am a victim of predatory lending, something is wrong when the families are torn apart, the elderly and XXXX have no rights or protection. 
XXXX never served or tried to serve me any kind of summons, letters nothing. They are wrong. I need help because I did not come into this house poor, broke, no money, etc. Since I have been paying them my mortgage for over a year and my bills I am broke. These people broke all kind of laws and it looks like they are getting away with it."
Mortgage,BOA sent me a modification letter becuase of my military service which I beleive was driven by their prior settlemetn with DOJ. I signed form and submitted it along with payments as instructed. After BOA automatically took out XXXX payments they stopped and when I called to ask what happened I was told I was in modification and could not make any payments. Since then BOA has not allowed me to make any payments and everytime I call they tell me they want new info etc ... Once I send the information I will keep getting mroe requests for more information until now they have initiated foreclosure. I am XXXX military and XXXX so it is on hold. I also have hired a lawyer but ti does not seem they have gotten anywhere with BOA either.
Mortgage,"I attempted to find out why Bank of America would not provide me with assignment information about my mortgage loan/promissory note when I asked them for it via a XXXX Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) ; however, they did not provide a sufficient answer about why they did not provide that information. Instead they chose to only mention their XXXX response to a second QWR ; in which they provided me with a false assignment XXXX years late. I believe that their failure to provide me with timely notice to the XXXX XXXX violated RESPA XXXX XXXX XXXX. I also believe that the fact that they had robo-signed a back-dated assignment years after the previous mortgager XXXX Countrywide XXXX, went out of business also violated the XXXX Judgment of the XXXX Mortgage XXXX. I further believe that they should be made accountable not only to me, but also to the States Attorneys, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CFPB XXXX, and to the Dept. of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, by whom they are being monitored according to the XXXX Judgment. 
What they did was wrong. They should not have been allowed, nor be allowed, to conduct business this way ; and they definitely should not be allowed to get away with it. 
I would also like to know why their responses ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX, mention that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is the current owner of the Note ; however, that not only does n't come up on the XXXX XXXX site, but I have also been given contradictory information that the Note holder is XXXX."

Mortgage,"I paid my mortgage on time and the full amount due. The amount I paid ( not including the online payment fee ) was {$520.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( it cleared on bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). When I received my next month 's statement on XXXX, I noticed that there was a "" payment advance '' charge for {$11.00}. When I called that same day to ask about this charge they told me that it was because I did n't make my full payment. So while still on the phone, I looked at my bank transactions and compared it to what Bank of America said I paid on my statement. The amount that cleared my bank was {$520.00} ( see attached bank statement ) but the amount stated on my mortgage statement was {$510.00}. An exact difference of {$11.00}. I 'm sorry, but this is shady business practices. They tried telling me that they 'd have to "" investigate '' it and call me back. Only when I told them no and if they did n't correct it while I 'm on the phone that I 'd be contacting to FTC to turn them in for shady banking practices did they correct it. I do n't believe this is an "" honest '' mistake. You ca n't tell me that a bank as big as Bank of America does n't know how much their customers pay. If they do n't then they have a much serious problem. I believe that they are systematically doing this to other customers hoping they wo n't notice a small amount such as {$11.00}. But {$11.00} over millions of customers equals a huge profit for Bank of America."
Mortgage,"My mortgage is currently serviced by Bank of America ( B of A ). It is a loan backed by XXXX XXXX  and is currently delinquent. On many occasions, I have sought loss mitigation efforts with XXXX and contacted their loss mitigation department regarding the same. B of A has refused to process my loan modification and issue clear underwriting determinations. Per XXXX regulation 24 CFR 203.604,  contact with the mortgagor, provides that "" the mortgagee must have a face to face meeting with the mortgagor, or make a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting, before three full monthly installments due on the mortgage are unpaid. '' Since the loan is insured by the XXXX XXXX, this regulation applies, as well as the liability reporting valid information to XXXX. It is clear that violations of the False Claims Act ( FCA ), 31 USC 3729 - 3733, since they knowingly withheld information and reported false records to a Federal Government Agency. 

After B of A started the loan modification process they transferred the debt to XXXX. XXXX has advised that B of A did not send over notification that the loan modification was in process. This action is a clear violation of CFPB law. Since XXXX is now proceeding with foreclosure action, I am seeking your assistance on this matter."
Mortgage,"I wrote a while back to let you know that I have been working with Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX to modify the terms of my home equity lines of credit and to no avail. 
We have spent the last 12 months submitting requested items to Bank Of America only to receive another declination in the mail this week. They are playing games and we have been paying the newly adjusted payment since XX/XX/XXXX that has quadrupled and is an extreme hardship. When the XXXX heloc adjusts XX/XX/XXXX we will no longer be able to live in this home we built and maintained for the past 19 years. Only with these XXXX loans extending the interest only portions for another 10 years will we be able to stay in this home. We are XXXX and I am forced to continue working due to the housing demise of XX/XX/XXXX that wiped out our XXXX with my total loss of income and my husband 's forced retirement who was on XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX now receiving half pension from XXXX where he was injured on the job in XX/XX/XXXX. 
We need help with these XXXX loans and requesting your intervention to make this happen.

Mortgage,"I am a victim of predatory lending. My mortgage rate is 10 %. I obtained my loan through Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX. I was told this was the only rate for which I was qualified, so I signed for it. I had no idea that this was not the average loan rate, or that I could have received a lower rate at that or any other institution. I was stuck! In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a loan modification. The application was wrongfully denied for incompleteness. I appealed, the bank admitted its mistake, then denied the loan based on housing expense and income eligibility. Bank of America NEVER addressed the predatory lending issue. I have managed to remain current on my mortgage payments but it is becoming increasingly more difficult as I have been forced into retirement, and my present income is now only XXXX % of what my working income was. I just want, and now, need a lower rate. The mortgage rate Bank of America is charging me is disgraceful and insulting, especially when the subprime rate is not even 10 %. Bank of America representatives will not even address the rate terms nor the detriment to my finances since XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America 's actions of charging me this outrageous and unfair rate can only be sighted as abusive. I have been completely taken advantage of by this institution. Through a lot of personal choices and lifestyle changes, I have as yet, made my mortgage payments on time, and because my payments have been on time, my situation has not been viewed as a hardship, although it is a hardship and it 's getting harder every month. It seems that as long as I am paying, and the bank is not losing any money, they see no need to modify this loan, lower this abusive rate, or do anything to help me stay in my house."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX RE : Bank of America Home Loans Account # XXXX To Whom It May Concern : We are a mother and daughter team who started a loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX and after completing numerous applications we are no closer to having this happen and are being threatened with a foreclosure. 

We have submitted several QWR 's and have not received the entire documents requested. Over the course of this process, we have been assigned more than XXXX member representatives, after being told in writing by the CEO, we were being assigned a representative that would be with us through the entire process of the loan modification. We were told on many occasions that the documents we sent to BOA, via XXXX XXXX or by BOA fax were not received, resulting in starting new loan modification requests. 

I am a XXXX survivor with a XXXX and during this process have become XXXX and XXXX due to this XXXX process Bank of America continues to inflict. My daughter XXXX became ill and was diagnosed with having had a XXXX XXXX. Over the course of this process, she has had several more and can no longer work. She has now been diagnosed with an XXXX. We would like to keep the home I purchased XXXX years ago. 

I went to XXXX County Housing seeking help and was informed by XXXX XXXX, the Director of the XXXX program, that the loans on my property were illegal. The XXXX program was how I became a XXXX as a young XXXX mother of XXXX. XXXX XXXX provided me with a copy of my deed and explained that there are restrictions on the property that would not have permitted the loans to be approved. Although with each loan we paid for a title search and title insurance to the lender the searches were either not completed or ignored. Had the title searches been performed and reviewed, the person ( s ) doing the search would have informed the lender of the restrictions on the property. Thus, they would not have approved and completed the loan request. 


I explained this to my lenders XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Bank of America. After XXXX XXXX researched the information and reviewed the deed, they have given us a Lien Release as paid in full. To date, we have not been able to get Bank of America to reply to or acknowledge our requests for the same. 

We are both, me at XXXX and XXXX at XXXX, dealing with XXXX and do not want to be homeless. So, we are imploring CFPB to help us. It has been a very difficult three years with all the game tactics Bank of America has invoked upon us. 

We are now in a time restraint and would like to hear from you and praying for a solution. 

Warm Regards,"

I have NOT applied for new loan ... modification or any other program Bank of America has. This is the continuation of the tactics they are using to confuse consumers or coral them into a program or loan that they did n't apply for.This bank needs to be made accountable.

Mortgage,"My mortgage is through bank of america. I also pay pmi which as of XX/XX/XXXX2016 it is suppose to be automatically terminated.

I originally financed through XXXX Bank and BofA bought the loan and on my loan docs it says by amortization schedule on XXXX XXXX, 2016 it is AUTOMATIC TERMINATION if current on payment and are at 78 % on ORIGINAL property value. PMI is XXXX per month and believe I should be refunded ( and not have it added to escrow ) for XXXX 2016 payment plus have it removed permanently. They are currently in breach of a legal binding contract."
Mortgage,"My name is XXXX XXXX, Bank of America sold the main loan, against my house at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC to XXXX ( now XXXX ) in XXXX, although the loan was already paid by Bank of America 's insurance/government bailout. The loan & debt are no longer valid debt, the type of loan of interest only for 10 years is a loan that is NO LONGER allowed to be offered to consumers, because it was a predatory loan. Bank of America only keeps records of loans for 7 years, Bank of America knew this fact, apparently Bank of America knew that before the 10 years were going to be over, they would have sold the information of the loan to another financial entity, 10 yrs. later, now in XXXX, XXXX is perpetrating some shady financial strategies, such as taking my home, and CHANGING MY ACCOUNT NUMBER ALL OF THE SUDDEN, also, XXXX NEVER APPLIED certain forbearance payments, in the amount of {$8000.00} plus to my loan. I disputed the amount of those forbearance payments, the first 6 mos. of said forbearance were paid religiously, and then I made the rest of payments till XXXX XXXX ; nonetheless they took the payments, some of their officials say that the forbearance was never approved, which is a lie, and they kept on taking said payments, then in XXXX of XXXX, I received two letters, in XXXX of them they XXXX stated that they had STOPPED ALL COLLECTION OF payments towards the loan, until the investigation of the thousands of dollars in payments were found on their side, I PROVIDED XXXX WITH THE VERIFICATION OF ALL OF THOSE PAYMENTS, I sent them said verification through certified mail and through fax, their last correspondence about this issue stated that the INVESTIGATION HAD NOT CONCLUDED, therefore the collection of payments had stopped, nonetheless, they were lying, and they continued sending the monthly statements, THOSE STATEMENTS NEVER SHOWED THE {$10000.00} I made in said monthly bills. WHILE THESE ISSUES WERE HAPPENING, XXXX DECIDED TO CHANGE MY ACCOUNT NUMBER, TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. I have been harassed, intimidated by XXXX, through their predatory debt collection tactics, they have made statements such as 'WE WILL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF YOUR EX-HUSBAND OF THE LOAN UNLESS YOU REFINANCE THE LOAN WITH US XXXX, and you need to send us a copy of the divorce agreement, XXXX got the loan in XXXX, yet I have been divorced since XXXX, and absolute divorce, and I DO NOT SPEAK TO MY EX- HUSBAND, because he was violent towards me, he was arrested, and he DID NOT STOP STALKING ME TILL XXXX OF XXXX, & I lost my job because he came to stalk me at my place of work in XXXX. I HAVE VIDEO DOCUMENTED MOST COMMUNICATION WITH XXXX and in some of the communication they HARASS ME, and they dont confirm NOR deny that they are in talks with my ex-husband, XXXX has come to look for my ex-husband at my address, I cooperated with said authorities. THE HARASSMENT FROM MY EX-HUSBAND IS SUPPORTED BY XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX REPS ACT AS XXXX DEBT COLLECTORS. Furthermore, I asked XXXX, and XXXX to please forgive the debt because I am XXXX, yet they continue harassing me, no matter what they have put me in foreclosure, with a law firm that in the documents they have been sending since the beginning of their threat of foreclosure, these LAWYERS STATE THEMSELVES THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW in the state of North Carolina. All of this harassment while they were discriminating against me because of my XXXX, also, I have been discriminated against by XXXX because of marital status, PLUS XXXX HAS ALSO INVADED MY PRIVACY BY ADDING MY EX-HUSBAND XXXX XXXX XXXX TO THE LOAN, I have all the video documentation, & documents ( sent here ) showing that the loan, is an illegal loan, a loan that can not longer be sold to consumers, because of its predatory nature. Bank of America sold loans to perpetuate debt."
Mortgage,"Immediately following my application I submitted a full document package with all requested materials, including a statement for the "" use of funds ''. My loan took 14 weeks to process because the bank is insufficiently staffed to handle loan volumes. My loan was never decisioned within Reg B time limits ; the bank worked around this by sending me a request letter frequently for a "" use of funds explanation '', something I provided numerous times, verbally and in writing. I was assigned 5 processors in the processor and could not contact anyone for help as I did not know who was servicing my file. 

A month after escalating issues to management, I noticed the Loan Consultant accessed my XXXX XXXX to obtain data about me which may have been used in the loan decision process as a formal approval was never received until the day before closing. Management asked me to provide this information, which I supplied, but I have not resolution on what was done with the copy of the XXXX XXXX I also asked a member of the management team to adjust my privacy preferences, and they indicated it would only be applicable to Home Equity, not elsewhere in the bank like I had asked. 

On Saturday after closing, I received an email saying my line was ready for use, which could not be correct as the loan was still in rescission until the following Tuesday. Numerous regulations are not followed, no follow-up or acknowledgement about my corporate complaint, and a bank is inadequately staffed to service its customers. Reg B and Privacy Regulators are not followed."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is requiring that I default on my loan for two months before they will consider a loan modification. XXXX of the reason I was denied in the past is because I have not missed payments on loan. At the present moment, I am getting assistance from someone else to help pay my loans so it does n't default. I do not feel it is fair to require a customer to default on their loan payments before they can be given a loan modification."
Mortgage,"My XXXX and I have a mortgage with Countrywide that merge in XXXX. However, countrywide has been taken over by Bank of America. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX my mother passed away. My motherandI shared a loan at country wide mortgage corp in XX/XX/XXXX. I have been paying this 30 year fixed mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX, day one.I am on the deed, title and tax assessments. The bank informed me that I was not on the loan. I was stunned by that information.So I sent them the following documents : Death Certificate, Deed..Title - with both names, Credit report showing loan with social security number and date of birth, Power of Attorney. 
After numerous phone calls and the bank supplying me with information on the loan. The Bank informed me that they can no longer speak to me because BOA requires a court ordered document. Why do I need a court order document when they pull my credit information andnow the credit report has me as deceased. 
I have never felt sodevastatedin my entire life. This banking institution does not care about people orhow theyfeel in a time of loss. 
Detailed Events : I received aletter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX "" Your home loan change request is complete '' .I assumed there was no problems because I did not hear from the bank. 
I received a letter from my home owner insurance dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX informing me that my home owners insurance will not be renewed. I immediately called Bank of America and they requested that I fax them a copy of the letter. I went to my insurance agent and quickly had them redo the home insurance so that there would be no lapse in coverage. MY HOME INSURANCE COMPANY WILL NOT RENEW MY COVERAGE BECAUSE CREDIT REPORT HAS ME DECEASED. 
Called Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and spoke with a customer representative that informed me that the original loan was refinanced in XXXX. She agreed to send me a copy of the original loan documents from Countrywideand refinance documents. Rep said that the original loan document was XXXX pages. Till this day XXXX XXXX i have not received any documents. 
I found out without my knowledge that my mother refinanced the house. My mother was a XXXX with XXXX XXXX. Refinance was conducted over the phone by XXXX loan. However, on the original loan there were XXXX social security numbers which the companydid notacknowledge.If they would have check the original document it shows that we were joint tenants. 
Call Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, XXXX spoke with customer representative who transferred me over to loan inquires. I spoke with XXXX and he disclosed what information that my mom used to open the loan. XXXX mention that she used XXXX and XXXX bank accounts. I mention again that the loan is on my credit history. He said that he going to send out a packet with loan refinance paperwork.I have never received a packet. 
Called Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, XXXX again and asked representative why did the bank do a credit inquiry in XXXX I was n't on the loan. She asked how did I know that there was a credit check completed by Bank of America. I sent my XXXX credit report. She put me on hold and came back to inform me that she can no longer assist me because I am not on this account. 
In this day andage I ca n't believe that such a thing can happen. By BOA going into my credit files reporting me as deceased, if I wanted to apply for loan, credit card.Iam coded in all XXXX credit bureau 's as deceased which has turned my life upside down.I am stillgrieving mymothers deathand caringfor my XXXX brotherthis could have not happen at worst in my life.We shared the same name not the same social security number. 
Whoever investigatesmy case CFPB please help me. Its very disheartening to see how this is effecting my existence."
Mortgage,"Bank of American delayed approval of my shortsale request for 18 months in violation of numerous regulations. I had a patient buyer who worked with me to constantly resubmit contract extensions as we awaited approval. While it was pending the last step, I called Bank of America on a daily basis for almost 1 month and never got a returned call -- and then just learned that they transferred the mortgage to XXXX and closed it this month without providing adequate notice and in violation of regulations."
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX, we applied to have our mortgage refinanced with Bank of America. Since BofA currently held our loan, we assumed it would be an easy process. We had a credit score in the XXXX, and XXXX of equity in our home. We wanted to pull out XXXX to pay off credit cards, as well as lower our interest rate. Upon application, we were told that all looked good, and we should close on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited for two weeks, with no response from BofA, even with several calls and emails. Finally, I talked with a supervisor, who said that our loan officer went on a family leave, and that our loan got dropped. If we still wanted the loan, we would need to reapply. So, I sent in all the paperwork a second time. This time the loan was assigned to a woman. After a couple of more weeks of not hearing back from her, I found out from a supervisor that she had gone on vacation. Our loan would be reassigned, but we would need to send in all the paperwork again. So, we did. This time things seemed to be going well, until they told us that they would not be able to have the house appraised until XX/XX/XXXX, due to a shortage of appraisers. I made several calls to several different supervisors, and was finally able to get the appraisal moved to XX/XX/XXXX. At this point, we were low on funds, so I asked XXXX at BofA if we could make our XXXX mortgage payment a couple of days late, when my next paycheck came in. She said that should be no problem. She said it would probably go to a committee for approval for the loan, but that they are "" real people '' and understand "" real life '' situations, so it should be fine. So, we paid the XXXX payment a few days late, at BofA 's approval. The appraisal was done, and appraised for right what we thought it would. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from BofA, saying that they were going to deny our loan because of the late XXXX payment! I went round and round with them on the phone, explaining that we paid it late with their blessing. They said they never said that. I asked them to pull the conversation, because they record everything, and hear it for themselves. They refused. They said there was nothing we could do. Our credit score went down because there were so many inquiries in such a short amount of time ( all from BofA ), and we had XXXX late mortgage payment ( in the 20 years of having our mortgage with them ... WITH THEIR BLESSING!!! ). Needless to say, we are so angry and hurt. Our credit has been damaged, the interest rates have since gone up ... if we can even get a loan now. BofA made so many promises that they did n't keep, they strung us along for 6 months with lies. I feel like our life has been ruined by BofA. If they had followed through with their initial promise of closing on XX/XX/XXXX, and not kept dropping the ball, none of this would have happened. I have since called BofA and left XXXX very detailed messages, asking to file a formal complaint, with XXXX promises of being called back in 24-48 hours, but of course have heard nothing. It 's been two weeks. I do n't know how a person like me can take on a large corporation like BofA, but I sure want to try. They have ruined our life. They only care about themselves and not their consumers. I believe they XXXX up our credit so we have no choice but to stay with them, and they do n't have to lend us the money ... .even though we have the equity in our house. Once again, big money wins."
Mortgage,"I consulted with HUD counselor in XXXX 2015 regarding options to lower my mortgage payment. In XXXX I received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/15 from Bank of America ; stating that XXXX XXXX would be my dedicated Customer Relationship Manager. I then received letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 congratulating me on being approved for Trial Period Plan, but I would have to return signed trial period plan and requested documents. I did not sign Trial Period Plan, nor did I submit requested documents, as I did not want to move forward with the modification or Trial Period Plan. In XXXX 2015 I spoke with XXXX XXXX directly ; letting her know that I did not want the modification, as is it would add time onto my mortgage. She stated, "" it is already in the works ''. When I questioned how this was possible without my signature, she responded, "" we assumed you wanted to move forward ''. I have continued paying my regular mortgage payments, yet there is a code on my account which delays the payment from being applied directly and results in reversals of late fees and unapplied funds. It appears my account is in the Trial Period Plan, although I did not sign or provide documentation requested to move forward with the modification trial period plan."
Mortgage,"This is a new Care ( THIS IS A NEW CASE ) Back in 2012 on case number XXXX CFPB assisted me with Bank of America ( BOA ). in 2012 BOA agreed with CFPB and myself and removed all the fraudulent information from my credit report show any late payments ( I have never been late ). I check again this morning and the fraudulent information was back on my report. 

I request all late payments be removed again ASAP.

Mortgage,"Hello - I reached out to Bank of America in XXXX of XXXX to look into refinancing my existing home loan. The main reason I went with them is because they have the loan already and I thought I could save some money/time. 

After going back and forth between loan officers the process got so confusing that I started asking questions. Knowing what I could sign electronically and what I couldn't was almost impossible to tell through their portal. Half of the time, uploading docs through the portal wouldn't work even though I ensured their size and formatting was correct. My questions to my primary and secondary loan officers went without answers. 

I pinged them multiple times to see where the loan was at - no response. When I finally got a hold of my loan officer, the time to provide documents that I didn't know the underwriters were asking for, had lapsed. Loan/attempt # 1 : Dead. 

The loan officer was so nice and convincing when talking to him about the disfunction - he owned up to not calling/communicating in a timely fashion. I was also now able to get a lower rate, so I went for it again. 

In early XXXX I tried the entire process again - paying for a new credit app fee again. Scanning documents and chasing info down again. This time I got it back to them very fast, concerned that the loan application could have the same issues as the first. 

The last correspondence I had with a loan officer was on XX/XX/XXXX. I made sure that the ball was in their court and I have that email to prove it. After getting nothing else back, I started to check in again with them to see where we were at. Each request got nothing back, so on XXXX, I CC 'd management and asked if they could get me a status. 

The sales manager/vice president ( of what I do not know ) came back with an email on XXXX stating that the loan had expired because of lack of needed documentation. I shared with him the email proving that I was in good standing and providing docs when asked. This time the Refi process went from "" you are good, we will let you know '' to "" the loan has expired because of the lack of documentation '' within 2 weeks. Each time I asked for a status after XX/XX/XXXX I got nothing back. 

They are supposedly working on getting me credited both credit application fees. Thank goodness there wasn't an appraisal fee associated. I will never use BOA again and will be actively shopping my refi around with someone else that I can hopefully trust. Sharing this in hopes that other will also avoid spending a ton of time and energy for nothing - stay away from BOA!!!"
Mortgage,"Complaint : XXXX Credit Union and Bank of AmericaHave been trying to modify XXXX and XXXX mortage loans with XXXX financial banks. Have already done modification with XXXX XXXX. Reduced loan which was small down to 4 %. Process was done within 30 days. 
XXXX XXXX Credit Union has been at best rude and really not interested in modification. Repeated had to call person who was in charge. Counterdicted themselves regularly and was told to be XXXX to four months late and will allow a short sale. Repeatly lost documents and made threats that they would not allow modifications if Visa card is not paid. Not interested in reducing interest rate and would rather have home. Verey unprofessional in collection activities on Visa card. 
Bank America mailed a letter to me about the {$95000.00} line of credit that is 100 % underwater. This was a mastercard line of credit with Countrywide. For almost 10 years have paid only interest only. Readjusting with principal in XXXX, XXXX. The readjustment makes no sense that payment should be {$780.00} not the {$980.00} on letter dated XXXX XXXX. After XXXX months of playing games with documents they made decision I could not afford any loan. The Home loan team offer a short sale if you can not afford the loan and gave no options except leaving the home. Kept calling and asking questions about my permanent XXXX and when I was going back to work. I repeatly stated it was not going away and I will never go back to work. I will be XXXX this year and have a XXXX that will just get worse never better. At best she was rude and and made threats to me you better pay this loan and your other creditors. In XXXX I was forced to retire on XXXX and had numerous charge offs. Had recovered on the credit bureuas to almost XXXX while paying all my creditors for 48 months. Started this process in XXXX all my scores dropped into the XXXX 's. There must be models in the credit bureuas that saw XXXX XXXX pay off loan and all the scores dropped over XXXX piints in days. Bank America stated in there XXXX denial I could not afford any loan. Based totally on the credit scores. Gave complete budget forms same as XXXX XXXX yet XXXX and Bank America considers us too high of a credit risk.

We have since went through XXXX modifications with them in which we were told not to make payments on our current mortgage until our modification was approved.

We have also been on time with payments since the beginning of XXXX but Bank of America shows XXXX, 30 day late payments at the end of last year. I have the receipts showing when those payments were made and still Bank of America and the credit bureaus have refused to remove the 30 day late marks on our credit."
Mortgage,"I would like to again submit another complaint or better, continue with our previous XXXX submitted in XXXX of 2015. To summarize, we have applied for a modification in XXXX of 2015 with Bank of America after our initial complaint to CFPB. After clearly explaining all reasons why our past modifications have been denied, mainly because we do not file XXXX tax returns, ONCE AGAIN they have declined our modification for the SAME REASON. They have wasted 3 months of requesting documents which we again clearly explained they were difficult to obtain ( even though we submitted our tax returns from our Country ) just for us to enter in their loop of false hope they call "" process ''. Last time we spoke with a representative on XXXX XXXX, 2015, they advised us that our application for modification had been denied, they told us they would send us documentation for our son to assume the loan ( another convenient alternative for them ). To this date XXXX/XXXX/2015, we have not received neither a written notification of denial nor an application for loan assumption. At this moment, we are in limbo and will not be able to refinance or modify our loan, meanwhile this huge lender still makes a nice profit on a loan at 6.5 %. I hope CFPB may intervene and stop their abusive practice, as Bank of America certainly is not there to help you."

That's ridiculous, but I was willing to deal with the policy. When I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status, they again said it would be 5-7 business days. I confirmed that this meant it should be refunded by XX/XX/XXXX, and they concurred. 

On XX/XX/XXXX it had still not been refunded to me. When I called again, they then stated that instead of the original 5-7 days, it would now take 10-15 days because the amount was so large. It does not take 10-15 days for funds to be credited in the current electronic banking environment. When they mistakenly took an additional {$200.00} dollars out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX, I called the same day and the funds were back in my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Clearly it does not take 15 days to confirm receipt of funds. Keeping almost {$14000.00} of my money for 2 weeks is nothing short of theft."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX and Bank of America have both announced policies on or about XXXX XXXX that prohibit using their services and credit cards for the purchase of certain firearms. They are only advancing general credit with no strings attached, as far as I can see from their card agreements, except, now, for certain firearm-related items. All such items are currently legal under federal law and the law of my state. Why can they make a policy that dictates what I can and can't buy with their plastic?"
Credit card or prepaid card,Someone keeps trying to use my identity to apply for a credit card. I keep getting emails from Bank of America stating that I have been denied for a credit card but I have not applied for a credit card.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I initially filed a dispute because I was dissatisfied with the merchants service. I cancelled my account with them and asked for a refund to which they replied it is nonrefundable. I filed thr dispute at the end of XXXX of this year. They were filed as separate claims for each transaction even though it was the same merchant. I kept having to go back and forth with the claims department due to the disorganization of the claims. They accepted two of my claims and then denied the rest, even though it was for the exact same thing with the exact same merchant. Their ultimate reasoning was that they don't interfere in gambling transactions. So I filed an appeal because it wasn't a gambling transaction. I gave them the relevant parts of the websites terms and conditions showing that it was a sweepstakes and gaming site. One agent in the claims department apologized to me saying they didn't handle the case properly and that he would escalate the appeal and that the merchants response was not strong so I should win the cases. That wasn't the case. I got an email today saying that they are still not going to help me with the my claim because they don't deal with gambling charges. So despite me showing and proving to them that it's a sweepstakes site. They took the easy way out and refused to do anything about it. What confuses me is that two of claims out of the XXXX are actually being disputed, why they couldn't work on the other ones is unclear to me since it's all the same merchant. Additionally it is illegal to gamble online in most states and I'm not in one of the states that allows online gambling anyway, so even if I wanted to gamble I couldn't. They are accusing me of lying saying it's a gambling site when the sites own terms and conditions show it's sweepstakes and games and that you can get free entries to the sweepstakes mailing requests in, no purchase necessary. That's not how gambling sites work. I am extremely upset because I've been working with them for over two months now and it's not even on chump change. One person says one thing and gets my hopes up then they deny it. This has happened like 3 times. I've been a customer with them for 11 years now and they won't even help me with something like this."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 I went to the Bank of America to see about using an offer from them sent in the mail to consolidate high interest credit debt. They initially had trouble with the mailing 's code, but overrode it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to make a payment on a XXXX Visa card only to find that Bank of America had paid {$5700.00} to this card on XX/XX/XXXX without my authorization. I had not even activated the Bank of America account and had no intention of paying the XXXX account using Bank of America. I placed a complaint through XXXX  and Bank of America did not show proof of my authorization, yet they have closed the fraud inquiry. This has not been resolved to my satisfaction as they insist I abide by their ruling."

However, I got a letter dated XX/XX/2022 that informed me that my claim was denied since my chip was read, which is not possible as I keep this card in a drawer at home and it has never left my apartment this year. It's also odd to me that it was rejected as I first noticed the fraud as a result of a Bank of America notification informing me of unusual activity."
Credit card or prepaid card,Starting on XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX there was unauthorized transactions done by an alleged family and close family friend. As I was displace and XXXX  because the house I was receiving mail at was my grandfather 's house that passed away leaving me to have no choice but to move out. So the alleged family member told me that all mail be stopped and return to sender so I called XXXX to let them know my situation then was told that they didn't have access to my account that I needed to contact bank of America so I did and they had suspended my card and was told that there was a claim to be filed so I did but told them how can I receive my card if the address on file is not valid no more due to me not living there no more so then was told to contact XXXX for change address so within the time frame I was checking in my account I wasn't able to get access to my account because someone had access to my account and set up my online account and I wasnt able to verify myself questions were set up without knowing and having no authorization on who or what the answers were given so every time I would call to get help on my situation it was a hassle I losing hope til recently I was given a bag full of my mail which was sent to me by my brother that he had found in my grandfather 's storage that only my alleged family had access to so I finally was able to get through with bank of America and filed a fraud claim that was made on XX/XX/XXXX that was then denied on XX/XX/XXXX due to being a reopen claim that was made last year in XXXX of XXXX which was done by not me but the person to whom was commiting fraud on my account. So I tried telling bank of America explaining my situation for them keep repeating that I'm not able to file a claim for all transactions made not by me so I was told I can only file a new claim for the transactions that were not on the claim which came out be only XXXX which didn't make sense if there was more then that amount that filed which the total amount should of been more then XXXX which would be {$29000.00} that I was defrauded for
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice in the mail that my Bank of America credit card had been put on hold due to suspected fraudulent activity. That weekend I also received an email notice that I had a new account on my credit report. On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America wanting to verify if the letter was legitimate communication from them. They informed me that a Bank Of America XXXX XXXX credit card had been opened. The name used to open and for which the account was granted was my former last name XXXX. The card was cancelled and a fraud notice applied. I have notified all XXXX credit agencies. But what I don't understand is if B of A was aware of my name change due to divorce 3 years ago, why would they approve a credit card with my old last name?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX. ) I contacted Bank of America on XX/XX/2022 regarding a purchase dispute. My Bank of America account is being illegally accessed which access was provided by Bank of America to unauthorized third parties. This is a fact since after imitating the dispute a hired actor or third party member of the public staged a stunt informing me that he knew about the dispute filed with Bank of America. I do not know this person and have never seen him before. This person is very likely a hired actor or agent working for the federal government, the intent of which is to interfere with my financial situation and by doing so interfere with or prevent further pursuit of the active lawsuit in the D.C Federal district court against one or more federal agencies. 
XXXX. ) Bank of America did not issue a temporary credit as is usual, customary, and consistent with its own procedures. Bank of America did not issue a claim number on the matter, therefore indicating that the claim had not been filed or properly handled. 
XXXX. ) I can not validate that the person from West Virginia who handled the call for Bank of America was actually an employee of Bank of America as she called from a number outside of Bank of America and she did not properly identify herself. 
XXXX. ) The intent of Bank of Americas fraud was and is intentional and to interfere with my finances to aid the government to prevent further legal action against the federal government i.e. XXXX as set forth above due to an active lawsuit I have filed against the government."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021, California EDD deposited a total of {$1900.00} into my pre-paid card XXXX Bank of America account. On XX/XX/2021 I checked my EDD Bank of America pre-paid card balance and it showed that Bank of America withdrew {$1000.00} from my account without my authorization. I called them to let them know they had taken the {$1000.00} from my account without my consent. XXXX, the first Bank rep I spoke with said she wasn't able to view that transaction so she asked XXXX of the higher-ups to look into it. Next she transferred me to XXXX from the XXXX department to confirm security, and then XXXX transferred me to XXXX in the claims department. XXXX stated that I'm claiming that someone fraudulently withdrew {$1000.00} from the ATM. I corrected XXXX by stating that my account shows that Bank Of America took {$1000.00} from my account and I did not consent to them taking it from my account. XXXX asked me where my card is kept and I told her in my wallet at home. XXXX decided to freeze my card and said I should receive another shortly. She also said that within 10 business days I'd get a Fraud Claims form to fill out and after the claims department review it could take up to 45 days for them to decide if they will honor the claim. It is unjust for Bank Of America to keep my money hostage that they took without permission and deliberate if they want to pay back my stolen money in 55 days or more."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Ironically I opened a credit building account with Bank of America in mid 2008 by them receiving a deposit from my account. Upon successfully completing the program before the end of the same year my deposit was to be returned to me. Bank of America claims that it did return my deposit by mail but to date I have not received said monies. I tried then to have the matter settled but they refused to accept responsibility for my deposit. Bank of America was and is unable to provide confirmation that the cheque was ever mailed, there was no registered slip, no return receipt."
Credit card or prepaid card,I maintain a Bank of America credit card for emergency use that has an annual fee. I moved back to the U.S. from overseas and didn't realize the payment was due as my mail was following me around. Bank of America proceeded to post negative information on my report and refused to remove it after I corrected the problem. I don't think credit card companies should be able to damage my credit rating solely for late payment of an annual fee.
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/XXXX I disputed an auto mechanic transaction due to not properly repairing my vehicle. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notification Bank of America Claims Resolution Department needed additional information due to information received from the merchant. Bank of America attached another customers claim information and personal information to my disputed claim. A BOA Representative acknowledged someone elses information was attached to my claim, apologized, and stated he would get the right information uploaded the message center on the same day in addition to mailing me a copy. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to several managers and supervisors to obtain a copy of the merchant documentation via fax, message center or by mail because I had not received the merchant documentation as promised via the message center on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite my many pleas to receive the appropriate merchant documentation that aligned to my claim I still did not receive the information I needed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the provisional credit I received was reversed and I received a letter claim # XXXX was denied conflicting with BOA Claim Manager and BOA Claim Supervisors request to extend the deadline. The letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicated the denial reason : We didnt receive a second opinion letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a new Claim ID # XXXX was assigned to my dispute with a 2nd denial letter generated 2 days afterward with 1 more denial reason ( 1 ) We didnt receive a second opinion letter ( 2 ) We didnt receive documentation stating what you were supposed to receive and how it was different from what you received.

Despite being told I would have the opportunity to review the merchant documentation and receiving another customers claim documentation through no fault of my own, deadline extension requests submitted by Claim Manager XXXX & Claim Supervisor XXXX, and my many attempts to receive the information that should have been attached to my claim 2 weeks before my dispute was denied twice within 2 days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a new Claim ID # XXXX was assigned to my dispute. This would mark the 4th Claim ID. The status of the claim was Researching-Claim Excluded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX BOA Claims Supervisor XXXX confirmed BOA Claims department had received faxed information including the 2nd Opinion Letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I finally received the merchant documentation in mail After reviewing the merchants documents, I identified several discrepancies with the merchants claims, fraudulent documents submitted, and the merchant admission he indeed caused damaged to my car that were not considered during the investigation because the claim had already been excluded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX On a call I was advised would be recorded by BOA ; I was told by BOA Claims Supervisor XXXX & BOA Claims Manager XXXX, that my case was in Arbitration and Bank of America does not make the decision of when the claim could be resolved. XXXX advised We ( BOA ) will present our facts so we are arbitrating to Visa why we would like this chargeback to the company and be refunded, and once visa reviewed the case, they will make a ruling. XXXX advised while you are disputing the charge you are not responsible for this part of the balance so I can minus {$1000.00} from my total balance. 

Claims Supervisor XXXX was very kind and professional however I wanted to speak with a Claims Manager regarding the merchant transaction remaining on my statement while the transaction is in arbitration when I am not expected to pay it. I wanted to get a better understanding of BOA Standard Operating Procedures.

I Escalated a complaint to Bank of America Executive Client Advocacy Group On XX/XX/XXXX During a call I was advised would be recorded ; XXXX from Bank of America Executive Client Advocacy Group communicated my claim had been closed and she was sorry.

The merchant has not provided compelling evidence in fact provided fraudulent evidence and admitted to doing improperly repairing my vehicle. Evidence from the Dealership, 2nd Opinion Letter and the Dealer Manufacturer supported the merchant did not follow the appropriate test procedures and improperly repaired my vehicle. 

Bank of America stated they had enough evidence the dealer indeed perform an improper repair and after escalating my complaint to another department they all of sudden didnt have enough evidence."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Complaint against Bank of America as they refused to assist me with both Credits Cards that were impacted in a fraudulent event, leading to another complaint submission : On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by an official XXXX number informing me that I was the main subject of a money laundering operation and that my profession as an anti-money laundering analyst strengthened their suspicion. I would later come to find that these individuals were not whom they said they were a defrauded me for {$23000.00} total between 3 accounts at BofA ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Checking account ). While on the call a number from XXXX XXXX Police Department came through which the fake XXXX rep told me to answer as they were 'working with local law enforcement '. The local police number confirmed what the XXXX rep had told me and when I was skeptical of their claims they then issued me an arrest warrant with instructions of how to handle the situation while under investigation. This included putting my funds into pay vouchers to avoid my funds being frozen which would be returned to me at the end of the investigation period if I was found to be innocent. The next 2 days consisted of them surveilling me and forcing me to convert my funds into pay vouchers via XXXX as well as the majority of my credit limit on my cards so a potential perpetrator would not be able to do so themselves. XXXX, they said, is XXXX of the companies whom law enforcement has an arrangement with for these circumstances and would allow for me to be refunded. As I continued to grow frustrated with the process I contacted XXXX Police Department on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX directly and asked for XXXX XXXX XXXX the fraudster claimed to be, and I was told there was no XXXX XXXX and that I would need to contact XXXX Police Department to inform. I spoke with police on XX/XX/XXXX and they walked me through what I needed to do to try and mitigate the situation the best I could and also contacted XXXX  to alert. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report, contacted the financial institutions which were impacted to report fraud, canceled cards, changed user names & passwords etc. 

My complaint is specifically for Bank of America whom I initially contacted on XX/XX/XXXX to report fraud. After BofA made me inform XXXX different departments of fraud for my checking account, Debit Card and XXXX XXXX. I was told that the process would take a week and they would reach out to discuss next steps. A week passed and I heard nothing back. I checked the other financial institutions I contacted to report fraud and they had all refunded charges and issued me new credit cards, except for Bank of America. 
I then contacted Bank of America again on XX/XX/XXXX for a status update and checking/debit departments said that there was no update, but they would expedite to a XXXX hour update window ( which I never heard back on ), and then transferred me to the credit card department to see if there was a status update there. The credit card department then said I never filed a fraud case, then backtracked to say they did see that I called in to notify, but even though I was deceived and defrauded ( which by legal definition is fraud ), I would not receive any credit back ... when it hadn't even been investigated yet. I then asked how have they left my XXXX credit card accounts I filed fraud on and requested new cards wide open for XXXX weeks and they said it was a mistake and they would do that immediately which was egregious. Then, after I had been defrauded for every XXXX I have I had to sell my only vehicle just so I could eat and pay bills. Upon deposit of the check from selling my vehicle, Bank of America only cleared 40 % of the check inexplicably leaving 60 % of the check on hold. After the 7 days it took to have that check clear, it turns out I couldn't access a XXXX of it. The reason I couldn't access it was because BofA somehow managed to close my account unbeknownst to me, without ever issuing me a new account, leaving the only funds I had to my name stuck in a closed account. Since then, BofA has continued drag this out to a degree I never thought possible. 
At this point, I have now filed multiple claims with Bank of America, a police report, multiple complaints to the CFPB and multiple complaints to Bank of America, and yet instead of assisting, BofA has managed to make this incredibly agonizing situation increasingly worse. The credit cards I will be referencing are XXXX which has now been resolved & XXXX which is the original card fraud occurred on & the newly issued card which replaced it. Upon my initial CFPB complaint, BofA had a representative named XXXX XXXX e-mail me on XX/XX/XXXX to state she would be my point of contact and she requested I reach out to her to confirm my contact information. I then e-mailed her on XXXX separate occasions to no response, and I called her XXXX separate times and left voicemails that were also never returned. Her e-mail states her hours of operation are XXXX - XXXX XXXX, yet I would sporadically get calls after XXXX XXXX, she would leave a message, and then not pick back up. I then receive a letter regarding account XXXX stating I was somehow responsible for the charges, but nothing in regard to XXXX. After relentlessly calling XXXX XXXX to try and understand what is happening to no avail, I eventually opted to pick up a random number after XXXX XXXX  knowing she has been actively trying to avoid me, and it was her. During that call, which did not go well, she told me she was only working on XXXX of the XXXX credit cards I filed on even though I filed claims for both with BofA, as well as complaints to CFPB on both cards. After having no rationale answer for why she was only working on XXXX card and not both, she agreed to work on both XXXX & XXXX as it was not only an error on her end, but it was all in regard to the same situation, the same transaction types, near identical amounts, nearly everything was identical on each card. Then what transpires is that I receive a letter from BofA stating that they completed they're investigation on XXXX and they were happy to inform me that the temporary credit that was extended to me is now permanent as fraud was identified. Now, I have XXXX XXXX telling me she is working on both cards, yet XXXX is fully resolved as fraud was identified, but XXXX which was involved in the same exact situation was inexplicably deemed not fraud and they rescinded my temporary credit and stuck me with a {$6500.00} balance on XXXX. I then repeatedly call XXXX and leave messages which once again are never responded to leaving to to call BofA directly. They then tell me they don't see that XXXX did anything to incorporate XXXX into the XXXX investigation and were profusely apologizing for the inconvenience & situation as a whole. I told the rep the entire situation & that this is not acceptable as I will now incur late fees/interest etc. all while the balance and "" missed payments '' will adversely affect my XXXX XXXX. She concurs and said she would put it into a 'dispute ' status so those things don't happen and ensured I wouldn't be charged, and I had to file yet another complaint with the CFPB to have the investigation re-opened. I then call again about a week later and then rep I received helped me re-open the investigation in late XXXX XXXX, yet I have heard nothing back. In the meantime, BofA lied about about me not being charged and has assessed late fees and interest charges to my account while under investigation ( which now stands at a balance of {$6600.00} ). Furthermore, they started reporting missed payments on these fraudulent charges to the credit bureaus while the case is still under investigation, and then had the audacity to send me a letter that they have cut my credit line on XXXX down from {$17000.00} to {$6900.00} which again has, and will continue to horrendously impact my XXXX XXXX an gives me even less options to try and get out of this mess. When I called about that all they did was apologize once again, acknowledged that it was entirely improper to do that, but ensure me there was nothing they can do unless I wanted to apply for another balance increase ( another XXXX XXXX hit ), but that I XXXX be subject to having them swap credit from XXXX account to XXXX and it essence, accomplish absolutely nothing. At this point, Bank of America is just as harmful and callous as the criminals who originally stole my life savings and destroyed my life, only difference being that Bank of America has tortured me for a much longer period of time than the criminals did."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I had my credit union send a payment of {$25.00} on both dates. The payments were sent and cashed by Bank of America. The payments were applied to a closed account which showed I had a credit of {$50.00}. I seen the mistake and asked them to transfer the {$50.00} credit to my open account. They said they couldn't do that and they would send me a check in the mail. That conversation took place on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with them on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I was told they need to investigate, the check was in the mail and I would receive a letter regarding the investigation. I received the letter today XX/XX/XXXX. The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX and they said they were investigating my open account with a different account number. After the numerous calls they are investigating the wrong account. I spent about XXXX minutes between two phone calls on hold at XXXX this morning and was kept on hold. I have given them the dates sent from my credit union with the confirmation numbers that they received the money and that was taken from my account. The closed account and the open account I was able to review on their website. On XX/XX/XXXX, the closed account was taken off the website. I was able to talk once with a manager but with no help. Bank of America employees have been rude to me and have given me the run around. Bank of America knows that I have a {$50.00} credit on my closed account which was even showing on the website. Also, they know when the payments were received."

Since then I have made numerous phone calls to BofA and spoken to multiple people. The claim was reopened and is still being investigated. Today XX/XX/XXXX I called BofA again and spoke to XXXX from Nevada. He said my account should have been resolved already, so the next step was to file a complaint that would take an additional 45 days to resolve. He filed the complaint.

Because this was unexpected and they were relatively young, there wasnt an insurance policy for burial. The burial expenses fell directly on me and my sister. Shortly after the second funeral, I became sick, spent three weeks in the hospital and was unable to work. All of this during a short time period caused me to fall pretty far. Between both of credit cards with BoA, I was only reported 30 days late once in the 5 years Ive had the account.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I made a purchase through a XXXX company on XX/XX/XXXX. The prices are listed in CAD dollars on the website with an option to convert to USD. The purchase was charged in the USD not the CAD equivalent ( {$140.00} CAD was charged as {$140.00} USD ). I reached out to the seller and sent screenshots of the website and how much I was charged. The seller stopped responding. 

I waited till XX/XX/XXXX when the payment was charged to my credit card account and disputed it through the online portal. The portal asked if I had any evidence to upload to the dispute to which I responded yes. The dispute was submitted without an option to upload any documents. I received an acknowledgement email and letter from Bank Of America which provided a mailing address or fax number to upload evidence. I was out of the country and returned on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Bank of America and asked if there a way to upload my email chain to the dispute and was told I need to wait 10 days for an agent to review my dispute to "" open '' the online portal to upload my documents. 

Why is it necessary to wait an additional 10 days to upload information I had when the dispute was opened? This process seems unnecessarily long and time consuming. First the consumer needs to wait 10 days for the dispute to be viewed, then upload the documents then wait again for the dispute to be reviewed a second time. This dispute only needed to be viewed once if the portal would allow me to upload the documentation the first time. Having a consumer go into a branch or fax documents is an antiquated system. If my dispute is submitted electronically, I expect to be able to submit the supporting documents for my dispute at the same time. While this wait is going on, the payment amount being disputed has not been refunded. This system is built to protect the bank and the seller, not the consumer."

However, I keep getting emails saying that Bank of America will NOT AutoPay the balance, but the minimum & NOT on the due date, but the day after-which can subject me to late fees & finance charges. Then I have to call and wait online sometimes for hours to get a refund. Today, I finally got someone on the phone XXXX @ XXXXcustomer service rep named XXXX, and having spent over 40 minutes explaining the problem she seemed to NOT understand she finally gave me an explanation that made absolutely no sense. Something about that a month prior to the last Statement I had a credit balance ( because Bank of America instead of AutoPay the statement balance it only AutoPaid the minimum, charge interest & I had to go through this whole thing then to get a refund, hence the credit balance ) and "" because of the credit balance, only the minimum is paid because Bank of America gets confused when there is a credit balance and doesn't know how much to AutoPay, even if the last statement has a balance ''.

An ATM withdrawal was approved on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00} from a Bank of America ATM. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, a withdrawal was approved for {$500.00} qt a XXXX XXXX ATM. Both taken place in XXXX, CA. 

The card is still in my possession to this day, XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a claim regarding the {$1500.00} debit from my account that I did not withdraw myself. 

Bank of America requested I do my own investigation and file a report with the XXXX XXXX Branch where the withdrawal happened. 

Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter that was dated XX/XX/XXXX that the matter was resolved and that they found both withdrawals valid. 

I firmly believe that Bank of America did not conduct a proper investigation. If they had actually looked into the ATM withdrawals and cameras of the ATM you would see that I was not making the withdrawal out of my account. 
Once again, I still have my original debit card that is now closed. Meaning there was a fraudulent card accepted by the ATM who had my pin number and was able to make the withdrawal. 

Due to this, I am seeing financial hardship as Bank of America has not refunded my account and yet the investigation as stated in the letter is closed."
Credit card or prepaid card,Bank of America stated I would be held responsible for a fraudulent charge that I did not make though XXXX. There is evidence submitted to them that the address on the card did not match the delivery address of the fraudulent charge.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I am a XXXX XXXX rewards member with Bank of Amercia, and I have been with them for many years. I received a fraud alert from the bank on XX/XX/2020, with 3 recent transaction listed, asking me if I had made those purchases. 2 out of the 3 were not mine, so I said no and the card was blocked. Since I had credit card fraud happen to me before, I knew I had to look back into my recent transaction history to find the fraudulent charges. I did and filed a claim. Charges were mostly made for XXXX gift cards, which I never buy, and a couple of charges at XXXX and XXXX XXXX in NV. I live in XXXX XXXX and have not left California since the lockdown started in XX/XX/2020. All of the NV charges also say "" online '' when I look up the details through online banking. A couple of weeks later I noticed the charges were back on my account and I received a letter from the bank that the claim was denied. The letter said the basis was that I was present at the time of these transactions and also the purchase pattern matched my purchase history. Both of these are groundless, as I don't have a history of buying XXXX gift cards or making XXXX or XXXX XXXX purchases. I had carefully examined my transactions to make sure I find ones that were fraudulent. I called the bank again ( talked to XXXX ) and also sent an email to XXXX XXXX describing the situation on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not given the name of the investigator, nor was I connected to the department to be able to talk to them directly. I had the back re-open the case and they said they'd get back to me soon. This week, I got a voice message from XXXX, a client advocate, saying that the claim was denied again. I have tried calling him and left a couple of messages, but haven't been able to connect with him to talk yet. 
I have proof that I was in CA on the dates of the NV transactions ( for example, My mom and I got our flu shots on XX/XX/XXXX at a XXXX in XXXX XXXX, which is the date of one of the NV XXXX XXXX transactions ). In fact, I can prove that I have been in CA this whole time. I have many meetings during the day ; my coworkers can attest to me sitting in my usual work place at home taking my meetings, and my location can also be proven from the IP addresses of my emails - I work at XXXX, which was formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX. My mom and other friends in the area that I have met in person can also attest to my presence in CA as well. The amount of the charges are a few XXXX dollars in total, so not a big deal for me, but this dysfunction and lack of professionalism and competency is beyond infuriating to me. So I looked up the way in which I can escalate this and this was one of the ways I found. 
I am not sure if this is a result of some kind of discrimination or stereotyping by the back or not. I will be taking every and any legal action possible to fight this. I have come too far to have my time wasted, my rights denied, and be disrespected by incompetent bank employees and/or executives."
Credit card or prepaid card,I paid my balance in full on XX/XX/XXXX I mistakenly shorted the amount by {$.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I was charged and interest fee of {$19.00}. I ignored the statement emails since I knew I paid the balance. On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed on credit karma my score dropped XXXX points when I looked it was BOA late payment. I pulled up past statements and found the shortage. I called and offered to pay the {$.00} they said I would have to pay in full and they would request the interest be removed but there is no guarantee. I was disgusted with this resolution so I paid in full and requested my account be closed. I feel this is unethical business practice and no one should do business with them.

For reasons unknown to me, XXXX did not record the transaction in my XXXX purchase history. XXXX requires that the buyer select the item he wishes to return from the buyer 's purchase history. As a result, when I repeatedly attempted to initiate XXXX 's return procedure, I was unable to do so. XXXX replied to each of my attempts stating "" We couldn't process your request because of a technical issue. Please try again. '' The seller originally listed the item as "" Returns Accepted. '' Later, XXXX advised me that the seller was offering me a "" partial refund of {$100.00}. '' After the transaction was concluded, the seller unilaterally changed the terms of the sale contract.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Copy of letter emailed and mailed to Bank of America Card holder services To : Bank of America Maryland Unemployment Benefits Debit Card Cardholder Services From : XXXX XXXX Re : Customer Complaint Date : XX/XX/XXXX This all began when I noticed unauthorized charges via my online account with Bank of America, on XX/XX/XXXX I called into your cardholder services line to report the issue and request to be refunded and a new card. Today XX/XX/XXXX I called back in as I still have not received the new card and spoke to a representative by the name XXXX XXXX XXXX. This representative, while not rude was not educated to assist me and seemed unsympathetic to my concerns. I stated my worry that I in addition to this issue had issues with my local usps carrier and some mail may have been returned and asked if there was anyway she could issue another card. As my fear was the original replacement card that was mailed out on XX/XX/XXXX may have already been returned by the Post Office. 

I was told by your fraud/risk department that my account has been adjusted and a new card will be received within 14 business. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, for days I have been calling, emailing, and constantly been given incorrect information. After being on hold each time for up to 3-4 hours at a time, and then yesterday when your risk department finally answered she claimed she could not hear me and hung up on me! I then had to call all over again and wait on hold again for 2 hours. I was able to speak to a customer services representative who took the time to read the notes on my account and determine no card was ever mailed to me at all!! As your risk team never removed some type of hold which enables your system to issue a call. This was very upsetting to know I have wasted hours, days even, weeks and to find nothing has been done. As I sit here typing this letter I am on hold once again in hopes to reaching someone. This is horrible to make people go through this. While a may not be a actual banking customer of Bank of America, by default I am and should be treated as such. This is the poorest I have ever been treated. Please accept this as my official complaint on how horrible it has been to do business with your company. Today XX/XX/XXXX I have been on the phone on hold for over 2 hours, still waiting to be transferred to the fraud/risk department as they are the only department that has the ability to remove this hold off my account to allow thier computer systems to ship me a replacement card. Meanwhile none of my bills are being paid and I have no other way to access my money. This is so unfair.

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX DEBIT CARD XXXX XXXX I noticed the charges on XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America and reported all unauthorized charges. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the XXXX XXXX XXXX' charge had not been reported so they opened a case for that one then. 

After hearing nothing I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. This is when I was told they had found the claim not in my favor. The reasons given was there was a deposit before the charges started. The deposit was from XXXX and unrelated to the unauthorized charges. There are deposits from XXXX every other Friday and have been for years. 
The other reason was they determined I had "" an existing relationship with the merchant '' this is untrue and they based it on a charge to a completely unrelated merchant that also used square. Their "" investigation '' simply amounted to, there was funds in the account and I had purchased from a different unrelated business that used the same credit card processing company. This is at best incompetent and seems to be more dishonest than incompetent."

They said that they needed to investigate it to reverse the payment and put the money back into my account, but that has still not occurred. 

Even if they do so, this is a theft. Whether this was a glitch in their system, or the result of an intentional act by a Bank of America employee, my checking account was severely overdrawn as a result of their actions. I am owed interest, or some other form of compensation, in addition to, of course, the return of the initial amount they wrongly removed from my private banking account.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2020, I paid my friend using the XXXX app. I had done this previously without any issues. This time, Bank of America charged a {$10.00} cash equivalency fee as well as categorized it as a cash advance, which assesses a higher interest rate. This is something that had never been done before. The bank made no effort to advise me about the change in policy. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX who refused to waive the fee. I asked to speak to a supervisor at which point she hung up on me. I then called back and spoke to XXXX who transferred me to her supervisor, XXXX who then transferred me to her supervisor, XXXX. In each case they refused to waive the fee and refused to reclassify the transaction as a regular purchase. While I understand the bank has changed their policy regarding charges made through XXXX and XXXX. This had never been communicated to me in the past. I feel it is dishonest of Bank of America to arbitrarily change its policies to charge additional fees without providing any forewarning. I understand the policy now, but feel the bank should waive the past fee and reclassify the transaction as a standard purchase."

2. After three months of a consistent {$25.00} minimum payment, my minimum due was increased to {$62.00}. Again, this seems like an attempt to trick me into paying less than the minimum payment, so they can both charge me a fee for failing to pay AND so they can remove the promotional APR I qualify for."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a credit card with Bank of America and have used promotional offers for balance transfers from credit cards. This is what they offer : "" A balance transfer has several benefits, including : Saving you money on interest and monthly charges Consolidating debt, which may help you pay it off faster One statement with one payment due each month '' So, I thought that if I paid my statement in full I will pay my purchases and the balance transfer, because they said "" one payment due each month ''. So I made a full payment of my balance on time, before the due date and I was charged interest, also, they said I still owe {$260.00} from my balance transfers. They do n't show the remaining balance related to balance transfers on their statements nor their website in their online bank, so there is no way for me to check what they are seeing or to check how much I have paid and how much I still owe. This is really a problem, because I do n't know if there is a mistake or not, if they are overcharging me or if what they say I owe is true or not. I do n't like to be late in my payments and I really do n't feel that the bank is being honest with me. 
It seems they apply my payments in the amount I owe from the statement, plus from the current purchases, but it is not clear how much they are applying to the remaining balance from my transfers I can show you my last statement if you need to see it. In my previous statement the total balance was XXXX and that 's what I paid and now they say I still owe {$260.00} due to the balance transfer. In the page where they post the Interest Charge Calculation, the balances there go up or down every month, even if I do n't do any new balance transfers and that is very confusing."

I actually have never purchased from my XXXX account, however I do have a XXXX account. 

The charges are as follows : - XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  for {$44.00} - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX CA for {$43.00} - XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX CA  for {$45.00} I immediately called Bank of America ( my card holder ) and alerted them that I was receiving fraudulent one-time passcodes from XXXX XXXX  and that I received 3 fraudulent purchases, all at the same vendor, all around the same amount. Bank of America immediately cancelled my card, issued a new one, and put a hold on my account and issued credits for the fraudulent charges. 

On XXXX XX/XX/2021, I was charged for the fraud dispute on my statement. I had not received any information about my fraud claim and no one contacted me for further information or evidence. I immediately called Bank of America and they informed me that the vendor ( who they could not provide me the name of ) had proof that I had received the "" goods.

Bank of America then opened up a complaint on my behalf since they did not do any investigating and didn't record my original notes. The complain number is # XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a "" locksmith '' come out to a hotel I was at to make a new keyfob as mine had been damaged. The locksmith quoted me {$280.00} written on a work order form. Although it seemed a little high I signed it anyway as they took a long time to arrive and I was late for a meeting. I then found my credit card was charged {$780.00}, not {$280.00}. I looked at the work order and they had written in additional items and changed the 2 to a 7, after I had signed and authorized the work. Attempts to contact the number on the work order went to a dead line. After further research I found out it was a fraudulent locksmith service that utilizes search engine techniques to direct searches for a local locksmith to a fake website that appears local, but the call goes to a central dispatch and an unlicensed locksmith performs the work at an enormous price. I filed a complaint with our state government and they confirmed it is a fraudulent service and sent the issue to the state attorney general for potential prosecution. I disputed the credit card charge and provided this information but they found in the merchant 's favor because there is a receipt with my signature on it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"The BOA unfairly closed my credit card account on XX/XX/XXXX. I am attaching the letter that mentions the two reasons : History of returned payments Recent balances in relation to your credit line are too high. 

The two reasons rest on a {$12000.00} payment that I attempted to make on XX/XX/XXXX over the phone. The customer service agent took the wrong information. I told him my ABA XXXX ACC XXXX. The agent took the ABA correctly. But he mistakenly removed XXXX digits XXXX from my ACC bank account. He wrote XXXX. 

I ask you to investigate and ask the bank to deliver the recording of that day so that you may corroborate my version of events. 

That payment took until XX/XX/XXXX in process until it was finally returned. I must note that this was the first payment returned in my account ( the plural of History of returned payments was not true ). During those 9-10 days of processing, BOA gave me availability of those funds from the payment I had submitted. If my balance went above my credit line, it was due to the bank 's decision to approve my charges. Still, as soon as the check was returned, I made the payment for the same {$12000.00} using the online payment, allowing the balance to drop below my limit. 

I am aware that BOA claims that the reason for the returned payment was the ABA I used. My bank gave me that ABA when I opened my checking account, and it remains valid ( XXXX XXXX  was acquired by XXXX ). So valid that on XX/XX/XXXX, just 3 days ago, I made a new payment to BOA with check # XXXX ( the same XXXX and XXXX that I used for the XX/XX/XXXX payment ) and my XXXX bank already paid it. Additionally, the BOA online service has used that same ABA for hundreds of payments for many years. And I use that ABA on all my other cards and accounts and have never had a problem. 

The reason why I realized the Bank 's mistake was that on XX/XX/XXXX I made a new payment over the phone, and for the second time, this time a female in customer service took the wrong informationsame mistake. Of course, the check was returned. This time, luckily for me, when I made the payment and gave the numbers to the agent, I took the precaution of recording my voice. 

I ask you again to clarify this situation asking the bank that last recording. 

I have called many times to BOA. Nobody wants to take responsibility. They prefer to transfer and transfer the phone call to all departments. Hours and hours invested in this. Not to tell the emotional cost of being treated unfairly. The abuse, however, does not stop there : First, I used to have XXXX WorldPoints, equivalent to {$4200.00} dollars in rewards. They eliminated them. 

Second, BOA has unfairly charged me finance charges for the XXXX payments returned due to its error. In fact, if they had taken the correct information, I would not have paid finance charges because I used to pay the balance in full, but due to their errors the first month ( XX/XX/XXXX ) they raised interest by {$900.00}. Not to tell the following months. And not to mention that for the XXXX checks returned due to the bank 's error, they charged me {$43.00} and {$49.00}. I wonder why I have to pay finance charges for bank errors."
Credit card or prepaid card,I had a bank of america credit card and went through some financial hardships during my last year of school in the beginning of 2017XXXX i was starting to establish a great relationship with bank of america by always paying my card on time and have had 13 years of great credit history. i had an account close during that year of financial hardship and sent to collections which i have now taken care of by settling and clearing it with bank of america back in XXXX this year. I want to start building a realtionship with bank of america again.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I made a cash advance of {$100.00} in mid XX/XX/XXXX. It had a promotional rate of 0 %. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I made double payments, but, the {$100.00} was not paid off. I inquired about this in XX/XX/XXXX. I was given an explanation about how payments were applied. I was then told that if I pay the minimum payment + the remaining cash advance balance, it would be complete. I asked why that had not already been done with my double payments. I still don't have a good answer. 

I asked that my payments be reallocated to satisfy the balance. The very next month, the line item on my statement showed no balance in the cash advance line. This  confirmed for me that the balance had been resolved. Fast forward 6 months. 

For my statement with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX, an amount has resurfaced in the amount of XXXX in the Direct Deposit and Check Cash Advance line with interest of .81. I have not requested another Check Cash Advance. Upon inquiry about this amount, I was told it was the same one from a year ago. 

I asked why this amount has not been appearing on my statements. I have not been given an answer. This looks like Bank of America tried to hide the amount in an effort to charge me interest without my knowledge. This also looks like Bank of America purposely chose not to pay off this small amount in order to find any and every opportunity to charge me interest. This is fraudulent. 

I keep being given the explanation that I should pay the remaining amount of the cash advance + the minimum payment but it was never applied when I was making more than the minimum payment. This was a small amount that should have been paid off long ago. I am being misled by Bank of America."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, This is a fraud complaint against Bank of America. There were funds withdrawn from my Bank of America EDD Card that was not me in the month of XXXX and XXXX. I did not realize this till XX/XX/XXXX and that is when I contacted BOA customer which then transferred me to the fraud department and this is when they had me verify which specific dates and locations that was not authorized by me. I explained to the representative that I did not give out my card or pin to any one and that I still have the physical Debit card in my possession. We then proceeded and clarified that the unauthorized withdrawals were listed below : XX/XX/XXXX - {$980.00} XXXX XXXX, CA XX/XX/XXXX - {$900.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XX/XX/XXXX - {$380.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XX/XX/XXXX - {$1000.00} XXXX, CA XX/XX/XXXX - {$800.00} XXXX, CA Grand Total : {$4000.00} After confirming all of the unauthorized withdrawals with the BOA representative, I asked "" isn't the max withdrawal at the ATM {$1000.00} per day? '' He agreed that, that is correct and doesn't look right, and he will note everything down. After, the representative informed me that he will close the EDD Debit Card that had fraudulent activities on it that is still in my position and that BOA will send me a new one to activate. Before hanging up, my question to the representative was what's the likely outcome of me receiving my money back and are there cameras at BOA ATMs to verify that it was not me and plus I still have my Debit Card and that it was not lost. The representative replied that "" I should get my money back once their fraud team finishes their investigation. However, it will take some time because they are backed up. '' On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from BOA dating XX/XX/XXXX that my "" claim number : XXXX has been closed '' for the amount of {$4000.00}. So, I called BOA right away and the representative even said, "" that doesn't look right '' and resubmitted my claim. Again, the representative states, "" It will take some time, just keep calling if there is no update. '' I called every 3-4 weeks after that and every BOA representative on the phone gave me the same three response : 1. "" Still under investigation '' 2. "" No new update just keep checking your account in case the funds may just appear in there '' 3. "" Account still closed, but advise to keep calling back, also reassures that it will be reimbursed once card is open/activated '' I stopped calling, once I received a mail on XX/XX/XXXX that dated XX/XX/XXXX that reviewed my case and "" based on the information, we're unable to credit your account and we now consider this dispute closed. '' In conclusion, BOA failed to help me their customer with the fraud committed against me in the amount of {$4000.00}. I only used Bank of America ATMs when withdrawing money and I always held the card with me which I still have with me till this day. I never gave out any of my personal information to anyone. So, I do not know how someone was able to withdraw money from my account and not only that withdraw more than the daily amount ( $ XXXX XXXX ) without any red flags or security alerts. In reality, Bank of America simply neglected to take care of their customer and find the culprit of this fraudulent activity."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am filing a complaint concerning a very misleading promotional mailer sent to me by Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, offering the opportunity for me to consolidate my debt and transfer any balances I have to my Bank of America XXXX XXXX  XXXX '' Visa Card. The letter offered two options ; either zero percent interest until XX/XX/XXXX ; ot 1.99 % interest until XX/XX/XXXX. The letter said, "" Choose the offer that's right for you. '' It seemed like a good deal, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to accept the offer of zero percent interest, using a check included in the mailer to transfer a balance of {$8400.00} that was on a different credit card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, in reviewing current charges to my XXXX   XXXX credit card statement, I noticed that in addition to the balance transfer was a separate transaction fee of {$250.00}. Not understanding what this was for, I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with a representative, who informed me that this was a 3 % fee that that bank charges for these balance transfers. 

The mailer that prompted me to accept this offer was very misleading and deliberately attempted to hide the fact that a 3 % fee would be charged. The mailer consisted of an offer letter on page one, followed by a page two that included the checks, and details of the promotional offer. 

The main promotional offer letter made no mention of the fee. It positioned the offer as "" 0 % '' interest until XX/XX/XXXX. It said nothing of the 3 % charge. In reviewing it again after the incident, I did find on page two a single line mentioning the 3 % charge, but it was buried at the end of a legal description of other terms and conditions. At the very bottom on the letter, there was a box that listed general terms, and mentions the 3 % fee, but it is not clear this fee applies to this special promotion. 

I am generally an educated consumer. It was clear to me that Bank of America sought to mislead me and others. The reality was that this wasn't a zero percent offer as advertised at all. It was a 3 % offer. 

To date, despite repeated efforts, I have not been able to get Bank of America to waive the fee, or even agree to allow me to repay the {$8400.00} and reverse the transaction, something I would be happy to do. I request your intervention to secure a refund this fee, or the opportunity to reverse the transaction completely."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank Of America mistakenly billed me twice for monthly payment on my XXXX Visa XXXX card and I have not been able to reach them to remove the second duplicate charge. This was a significant amount of money that I no longer have access to. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I my bank account was charged my normal autopay amount that paid off my credit card statement in full. On XX/XX/XXXX I was charged the exact same amount again. Bank of America does not offer chat or email customer support, so I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to have them reverse the charge. Bank of America was not able to do this and had me call a different line to speak to a department that covers the XXXX card. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX, both times the hold time was over 1.5 hours, so I selected the option to receive a call back from their support. I never did."

Once I saw that, I called the bank and notified them these were not authorized. They took those 4 and flagged them, and issued a fraud dispute credit for those. Few days later I check again and I see the XXXX charge never left pending and then just dropped off, they must have caught that fast enough to not process. So somehow a XXXX in store charge of {$56.00} completed on XXXX was then flagged as fraudulent and was given {$56.00} in credit on XX/XX/XXXX. I realized that it was incorrectly labeled as fraudulent, and spoke to a fraud specialist, notified them the {$56.00} was valid and they took that as all the charges were approved. I called again explaining this and was told they see what happened and reopened the claim, called again today XX/XX/XXXX as the claim was still listed as resolved and still have the fraudulent charges and finance charges applied to my account. I was informed that the case will be reopened today and will take 45 days to reach determination. Meanwhile the first time the case was opened I was credited the next day.I"

Credit card or prepaid card,"I paid my card balance to Bank of America in full on XXXX a balance of XXXX. This money was deducted from my checking account. On the XXXX of XXXX, Bank of American deducted this exact amount from my checking account again. I contacted them and was told that I would receive a check for that amount as a refund. On the XXXX of XXXX, I was at a XXXX balance because of this conversation. I never received the check. Then, on the XXXX, I was charged {$2700.00} two more times, as well as returned check fee of {$27.00}, and an interest charge of {$39.00}. I discovered this on the XXXX and I called Bank of America, and over the course of several hours spoke to four different people. I was told that they never received any payment from my bank, although it was clearly deducted from my bank account. The money appears to be gone from my checking account, and I somehow owe Bank of America {$5500.00}. I was told that the bank stopped the payment and that I should have the balance in my bank account in five business days, at which point I could pay my balance. I asked for a refund of the fees, since the situation was due to their error, and they refused, but said that Bank of America could discuss refunding the fees on the XXXX after I paid my balance. I asked to close my account, and then proceeded to do so. I then asked for the person 's direct line so that we could discuss refunding the fees on the XXXX, assuming that the $ XXXX was posted to my checking account. After he closed my account, he told me that because my account was closed he could not refund my fees. He did not advise me of this information before I closed the account, and led me to believe that the fees could potentially be refunded at a later date."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a request from Bank of America for income verification and my social security verification. The letter was dated XX/XX/2021. I put together all the requested information, prepared a package and called Bank of America on XX/XX/2021 to ask them if they had a fax # or an email address where I could send the documents they requested, to avoid delays, save time in the mail and avoid sending personal identifying information in the mail. The gentleman I spoke to told me BofA did not have that option. The only option was using the prepaid envelope provided in the request and mail it back to them. I specifically asked the gentleman to make notes in the account that I was placing the paperwork in the mail the same day I was talking to him on the phone. He said he did. I wouldn't know. I mailed the paperwork to them on XX/XX/2021, immediately after talking to the BofA representative on the phone. I did not hear anything back from BofA until today, XX/XX/2021 when I called to follow up on the status of my account. I punched in the last 4 digits of my card number, an announcement came up telling me "" this account is closed ''. I was furious. I had no idea my account was closed. I received no calls, no emails, no texts, no alerts, no correspondence in the mail. I called BofA, I got transferred, to learn that the reason BofA closed my account was because they received my income and ID verification documents "" 2 days late ''. The letter BofA sent me specified that I had 30 days to comply, and I was way ahead of these 30 days when I sent them the paperwork in their own postmark paid envelope. The mail went out on XX/XX/2021, 2 days after receiving their request, and I diligently made a note of that. This is illegal practice by this bank. I did everything in a timely manner, I received the letter on the XXXX, and mailed the requested documents out to them on the XXXX of XXXX. Somehow, my paperwork fell through the cracks within BofA organization, or was sitting on someone's desk under a pile and got forgotten, and for that reason I am being penalized by BofA because they failed to process my information in a timely manner on their end. This is UNACCEPTABLE. This bank is clearly not practicing within the boundaries of their own time regulations. They have no right to close my account without properly checking their records, reading notes, checking the dates. They simply closed my account. End of story."

I told them I had denied all charges and that it was a stolen credit card. I then went to Sheriff 's Office and filed complaint. The person who used credit card was arrested that same evening for credit card fraud. Then even though XXXX XXXX knew he used stolen credit cards to make these purchases, after being notified that XXXX would not honor their charges, XXXX XXXX pulled the rejected charge slip and charged the same transactions against my Bank of America credit card on XX/XX/ and even though I only had {$5.00} on account before I went over credit limit, Bank of America allowed the charges to go through.

From further research I found out that the translation means photography company, yet listed as a bar / restaurant business. I do not know why it shows my chip was inserted and I do not have any other users on the same account. I also have not given any of my credit card information to this merchant. 

Originally I thought this was the taxi driver entering a wrong amount, as that was the only transaction I have made in that time frame. I tried contacting Bank of America as soon as I saw the charge to ask for help. It was filed as a claim to dispute the amount, when it should have been filed as a fraud claim. This claim eventually was marked closed and I was still charged this amount. I then called again to get more information and was told that BoA will ask the merchant for a signed receipt, a few days later I was told that they will not do that and it is deemed a "" valid charge ''. It is ridiculous that BoA is claiming that I authorized a $ XXXX transaction it at a self serve kiosk that doesn't require a pin or signature. 

I would like CFPB to help resolve this and get BoA who claims that there is a {$0.00} fraud liability to keep their promise. I am happy to sign an affidavit or file a police report as proof."

The platinum plus version has more rules and less benefits/rewards which I would have not applied for otherwise. 

Why the bait and switch Bank of America? If you could not approve me for the XXXX signature why not just deny my application instead of these tactics. All it does is frustrate the customer and make them not want to use BoA at all anymore. The XXXX signature and Platinum Plus are different products with different rates, fees, benefits, terms."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This is a follow up to a previous submission with respect to Spirit Airlines. The CFPB falsely stated that they contacted me for more information. I never received any request from the CFPB for more information. I do not know what information could possibly be needed since no one contacted me about anything. I think CFPB is political ly charged and investigates claims when it wants to based what side of the political fence the issue falls upon. Obviously, this was not the right side this the false claim was made and no investigation occurred. For the record, spirit cancelled my flight and left me stranded in XXXX for 7 days. Spirit never offered or provided any travel voucher or other means of compensation for the matter. The original issue follows to which you alleged a request of information which you did not or at least I never received such request. 

The problem here is with Spirit Airlines which is required to comply with XXXX rules as far as transactions go and FAA rules with the handling and processing of significant delays and carrier cancellations. Spirit Airlines complies with neither. Take for example three confirmation codes as follows : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. What spirit does which not only skirts the said rules/statutes, it, also, improperly and via irreparable harm places a hold on funds for several days ( in some cases up to 3 business days ) thereby preventing the use of funds, since this is a debit card, not a credit card, and then after holding up the funds Spirit releases the hold and cancels the confirmation code associated with the attempted booking. Now, what is particularly important is that there is a link between Spirit Airlines and illegal monitoring of my internet data, since I I literally watching Spirit Airlines change and modify flight details like price in particular as I am actually walking through the steps to finalizing the booking. And all of this occurs very quickly usually in under a minute. So what we have here is almost like some sort of criminal intent whereas Spirit Airlines is trying to control or override my free my free will by creating impossible, irregular, unreasonable delays, and extraordinarily costs the intent or which is to interfere with my travel itinerary. Then they have the audacity, after trying to scam me, to try and XXXX me more by asking for more money I.e. modification and upcharge fees for their FAA non-compliance. This non-sense with Spirit Airlines is surreal."

Regrettably, even after one month had elapsed, I still had not received the replacement check. Frustrated by the ongoing delay, I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. They reassured me that they would address the matter promptly. However, it was not until XX/XX/XXXX, that I received another letter from Bank of America, which assigned a new case number, XXXX. 

Despite my continued efforts to resolve this issue, including contacting Bank of America once again on XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to receive the corrected check. Their response was to provide me with a new ticket number, XXXX, and instruct me to call back in 5-7 business days.

However, it is disheartening that they have failed to resolve the problem thus far. I am exhausted from this ongoing ordeal and have lost faith in their ability to rectify the situation."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received an email receipt notifying me that a charge of {$970.00} was made on my Back of American credit card and a new account was create at some XXXX XXXX company. The date of this email was XX/XX/2021. I immediately call Bank of America to cancel my credit card and report the fraud. I also called the XXXX company using the phone number in their receipt email and told them it was fraud and to cancel the account. Both the Bank of America and the XXXX company were call XXXX. At then end of my credit card back statement cycle, I saw the bank had taken the money out of my account and paid XXXX. This occurred at the beginning of XXXX. I called the Bank of America back and see why they paid the merchant and was told the fraud report was still under investigation and that within another 30 days it should be resolved and my money put back into my account. I have been calling the bank now for several weeks to get a resolution but they kept telling me that there is no fraud claim even when I give them the claim number. The money was never put back in my Bank of America credit card account even though It should have never been paid in the first place. The bank has offered no resolution or even acknowledged the fact that I submitted a claim. I can still see the claim in the Bank of America app and its in an investigation status. Since the Bank keeps telling me that they dont see a claim and I have to open a new one if I want to report fraud, I am look for help from someone to get my money back and report the terrible customer service I experienced at the Bank of America XXXX Thank you!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021 a charge in the amount of {$27.00} was made at a XXXX via the counter. Immediately after the same person attempted to make two cash withdrawals from the ATM machine located inside the same store. First two attempts were declined, Im assuming due to having a transaction limit of {$160.00} on my account to protect myself from having things just like what happened next. After two failed ATM withdrawals, their 3rd attempt was allowed to go thru for {$260.00}, well above the protections I had set up for myself. When I noticed the charges the very next day, I immediately file a fraudulent claim in regards to the two charges. At that time B of A alerted me that a person had made a duplicate copy of my card and THATS how it had been used. This investigation was completed in a very timely manner and Ive got the letter explaining a permanent credit and no further action from me would be needed. Well to say the least, further action has been consuming my life each and every day with lies, turnarounds and completely opposite statements from day to day. A month last Im still waiting on my {$290.00} to be credited to my account. Im told each day that the investigations team who lost my permanent credit is now investigating themselves as to how/where my permanent credit actually went. NONE OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY MY FAULT WHATSOEVER. B of A only says it can take up to 30 days to get your money thats rightfully yours. I dont have another minute to wait. I have filed multiple missing credit claims as well as hardship claims. None of which I have done a damn thing to get anyone to even blink an eye at my claim."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I hope all is well.. 

I would like to state thank you very much for giving me a credit card with your company for all these years. Its very much appreciated. The first time in all the years I have had my credit card during the pandemic of the Corona virus I was late a couple times for the first times. I really do apologize my hours were reduced and I had a baby as well. It will not happen again because Im back working my regular hours and my newborn and son are in daycare while I work or my mothers watches them. Im about to pay the card completely off and as a courtesy can you please take off all the late fees that occurred because it was the pandemic fault. This will help me out a lot, I really do apologize this my first time being late a couple times ever since I started with the credit card. Please take all the late fees off. I will be paying the credit card off in the next couple of months. I really need the late fees off it will really help me. Thank you very much. Have a wonderful day and please be safe.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 Bank of America transferred funds in the amount of {$28000.00} from my bank accounts with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This amount was in error and I immediately call both Bank of America and XXXX XXXX. I made a request to return the whole amount. I was told by both Bank of America and XXXX XXXX that it should take 2-5 days. When I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, asking why the funds were not transferred, they said they have a policy that wont allow them to transfer a large amount of money without internal protocol. I was told it could take until XX/XX/XXXX to make the transfer. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and was told they have until XXXX to make the transfer. On XX/XX/XXXX the transfer was not made."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I called Bank of America in XX/XX/XXXX stating my business is going through a Natural Disaster when one of my warehouses burnt down and I am spending my time fixing the situation. They notated that and from there I somehow accumulated 2 late fees. I pay via Autopay all the time via Minimum Payment Due. BUT with Bank of America they do not have that option so when the interest went higher my Minimum Payment Due went higher and the past 2 months I didn't cover it. 

I did not foresee it due to the Natural Disaster happening. SO I called them stating to remove the 2 charges and they said OK but it never gotten done I am writing to Consumer Finance to help me in this situation as they 1. Do not have an Autopay option for Minimum Payment Due to avoid this situation. 
2. I went through a Natural Disaster and Bank of America should have the consumer in mind. 
3. I overpaid the minimum and now making larger payments and Bank of America did not have this in mind."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Im writing to complain about Bank of America credit card company. I am a card holder with Bank of America specifically XXXX XXXX Mastercard. On XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018 had unauthorized charges totally over 8k. My XXXX  child snuck my credit card and wrote down the information on a piece of paper and began to charge over 30 times to a fraudulant company with out my authorization. At one point the credit card transaction exceeded beyond the credit limit by about 2k. Yet Bank of America continued to let these charges go through with out putting a fraud alert and stop to further use of access. On XX/XX/2018 when i noticed the unauthorized charges I immediately contacted the Bank of America fraud department while the the charges were still pending. I explained that I did not authorize these charges and the situation. Some but not all the unauthorized transactions were disputed and was given a credit of {$6600.00}. I called back the next day to inform them they did not include all the charges. They said they would and it never happened. I get a phone call from a fraud representative on XX/XX/2018 stating that my fraud investigation would be closed and all the credits applied would be reinstated. I asked why the representive told me because it was someone I knew and my own child that it was not fraud. I explained that i read my terms and condtions of my credit card and have a {$0.00} dollar liability towards any unauthorized transactions. The representative then hung up on me. I called back to speak with another representive about the situation and explained I thoroughly reads my terms and conditions of my credit contract and that my {$0.00} dollar unauthorized transaction does not exclude anyone including minor children or whom i know. I did not give authorazition for any of the transactions and that Bank of America was violating my terms and conditions of our credit card agreement. The federal trade commission anda states I am not liable for any unauthorized transactions and it does not exclude anyone. I reported the activity in a timely matter. I also explained that as a card holder i have very limited history of spending period and that based on the excessive charges and amounts to the same merchant and within a very small window time frame to include going over the limit which I never have, they should have protected my account security and done something to prevent this to where it wasnt exacerbated to this extent. As of XX/XX/2018 my fraud claim is closed. I have been charged back the unauthorized charges and Bank of America has not written me a letter of explanation. Although it says in the message center to see attached letter there is none. My account has always been in good standing and being over the limit on my credit card negatively affects my credit score and rating. Once again i did not authorize the charges."
Credit card or prepaid card,I tried to find out how much I owed Bank of America by calling their phone. They would not give me the amount until I gave them information on my brother & son who have nothing to do with our cards or money. They wanted personal information like where they lived & more. We have always paid on time. I never got the amount owed.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America credit card is DISGUSTING! I purchased renters insurance for one year with XXXX XXXX ( through XXXX and a HUGE MISTAKE! ) on XX/XX/XXXX for {$140.00}. The agent charged me and stated I would get the declaration page through email but days went by and I never received it. XXXX couldnt find my policy nor my information the five times I called. So I disputed it with the bank. Finally, XXXX found my policy ( which was really weird ) so I then closed the dispute and the funds were put back onto my card. 
A few weeks later XXXX started harassing me that I did not pay the policy in full and I still owed money. XXXX claims BOA never released the funds ( basically stole my money ) I even reached out to XXXX XXXX, from XXXX XXXX ( who now changed her number ) who stated my policy is paid in full and to ignore all the emails. 
Well now, I AM WITHOUT RENTERS DUE TO XXXX CANCELLING ME!!!! 
First off, I want to explain the lack of customer service skills BOA representatives have. They literally will not answer your call for up to an hour, each and every time you call. It does not matter what day of the week nor time of day, know that you will be waiting on the phone for a ridiculous amount of time. That is unacceptable. The representatives have been giving me the run around about the dispute. One rep in particular, XXXX, left me a VM and I have been calling her back 3 times every day since and she still has not responded. After reporting them to the XXXX, they are doing the bare minimum to say they are at least responding, but no one is really working on it. I called yesterday and after waiting two hours to talk to someone, I was told there wasnt even a claim number for my dispute!!!! 
Plus, BOA is keeping the funds on my credit card even though that amount is being disputed and the service is cancelled!! 
BOA is insisting XXXX has my funds so they are not doing anything about it. I am NOT PAYING for a service I no longer have. One of these companies stole my money and I for sure am not letting this go until I get refunded!! 

Please note- if you need any other documents for proof, I will gladly provide them to you!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America is the bank that manages my California Unemployment Benefits Card. BofA blocked my card onXX/XX/XXXXbecause I returned a home appliance originally purchased with the card - the credit registered with them as fraud XXXX it is not ). My card is now closed and I can not access the {$10000.00} on my card. I have been on hold at Bank of America for 5.5 hours so far today trying to clear the issue. Their system has hung up on me over 8 times. I am put on hold for over an hour at a time, and then the BofA system ends the call - I have to call back in and start at the beginning of the process all over again. I asked to speak to a supervisor in the fraud department to try to get help and I was told the supervisors were all going into a meeting but someone would be back with me. That was over an hour ago. Bank of America is making it impossible for me to access my funds. This is honestly boarding on criminal and abusive treatment by the bank."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/2020 I owed {$27.00} on my Bank of America credit card. I paid them. My balance was then XXXX. They then charged me this amount again and debited this from my bank account. They had no authorization at no time ever to do so. I havent used the card since then. I tried desperately to correct this with the organization. I've made phone calls, left XXXX messages, plus sent two or three emails -- all of owhich were ignored. On two calls, they admit their fault. Bank of America still didnt remove the charge. I filed a XXXX  complaint ( which they refused to respond to ) I disputed the {$27.00} charge with my own bank and it was settled in my favor. Interestingly, it also no longer appears on my Bank of America statements -- just the {$25.00} -- now {$26.00} charge. 

Now, Bank of America charging me {$25.00} for a returned check fee. Then they tacked on a {$1.00} late fee because I refused to pay the {$25.00}. Thing with them they are non-responsive and unwilling to assist the customer and I owe them nothing."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/ i was charged a "" cash equivalent transaction fee '' in the amount of XXXX after buying a purse online for XXXX via XXXX... .this was done on a bank of America credit card . I called today and spent 54 minutes on the phone with 2 representatives who told me it was processed as a cash advance despite the fact the checkout clearly showed a visa logo. The representatives told me they were unwilling to refund the fee and know that it was a mistake but sometimes it happens and it is the problem of the customer and they refused to refund the fee. If there is a visa logo it should be processed as a credit card same as anywhere else, I want this fee reversed."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In 2022, there was a fraudulent savings account opened in my maiden name, at Bank of America. I had the account closed and froze my credit, as well as put a fraud alert out on my social security number. Just yesterday I received an email from Bank of America about a credit card application with them. I did not apply for any credit card. Since I have a credit freeze, the card was not opened. I did call them to make sure the application was reported as fraud. The strange part is with both the savings account and the credit card, both my real email and address were used. I am starting to worry that it is the Bank opening unauthorized accounts rather than identity theft."
