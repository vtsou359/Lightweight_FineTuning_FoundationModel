Product,Consumer complaint narrative
Mortgage,"I have had a mortgage with Bank of America for about 13 years. It has been beyond challenging every step of the way. The mortgage is in the name of the Estate of my deceased partner. Early on, I sent B of A documentation dozens of times in order for me to have access to the account allowing B of A to discuss the loan with me. Finally the last few years have been somewhat smooth as I am the only one associated with and paying this loan. I pay the mortgage on time and for the past 3 years or so have been paying an extra {$500.00} a week. Finally their system was posting the extra payments properly to principle.

B of A recently transferred my mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX. It should be mandatory that when a company transfers a mortgage they they transfer the mortgage with all documents and authorizations that belong to the mortgage. Bank of America did not do that. 

I called XXXX and via the automated system was able to deduce that they are not posting my {$500.00} to principle but instead to future payments. That is not the way I want it and I have the right to make extra principle payments. The problem is XXXX refuses to speak to me because they way I'm not authorized on the account. INFURIATING!! 

They say I have do dig up the past related to the death of my partner and find old documents and prove I'm authorized on the account. I'M NOT DOING IT! Bank of America has those documents and has received them more times that I want to recall. Bank of America needs to contact XXXX with the documents and then get all of the principle payments sorted out as that is impacting the amount of interest I pay. The consumer should not have to fix the problems that to big lazy institutions have created. These kinds of errors and sloppy postings could ultimately create issues that might impact my credit. I want this fixed now but B of A and XXXX."
Mortgage,"I received an unfair and very upsetting response from Bank of America regarding my payment that they debit from my account, when I made a payment on XXXX XXXXJust because I am behind on my payments that does not allow them to take more then XXXX payment without my authorization. Please investigate this case and have them credit my account XXXX payment as a courtesy due to drafting my payment for more than XXXX payment and fess from my checking account and leaving me with any money to feed my kids or gas for work and unable to pay my bills. Its was snowing that day and was scare my light was going to get cut off because I did not have the funds available to make my payment because they took all my funds from my checking. Plus they charged me NSF fees because I placed a stop on my payment and took my bank XXXX to XXXX days to clear that transaction."
Mortgage,"I fell behind with my mortgage payment during the years of XXXX and XXXX. I worked with the mortgage company, ( Bank of America ) and received a loan modification. However by the time the modification was approved, I owed Bank of America about {$14000.00}. Its roughly 5 months behind in our mortgage payment. This amount is not subject to interest or penalties. However, I was informed by the Treasury Department that bank of America received a bailout from the government for all of these modifications. I think Bank of America has received payment from the government for my {$14000.00} and they are still holding me liable for this amount. Please investigate the reason why I still see this amount on my mortgage statement every month since the modification has been approved and Bank of America collected funds from the government for mortgage modifications."
Mortgage,"Loan Modification with Bank of America with devastating results : I am a senior citizen living on a social security budget. I was unable to keep up the payments of {$1000.00} per month for about 9 months when I was given a modification with Bank of America in XXXX, XXXX, at that time I had paid three months of trial payment, I owe about XXXX for late payments and penalties before I made the trial payments. I am XXXX due to XXXX, my doctor can provide proof on my condition. BofA 's notice and instruction on how to sign the Modification Agreement was dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX but I did not receive the letter until XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the letter stated that I must return the signed agreement by XXXX XXXX XXXX, given the limited time to respond acceptance of the modification agreement, I panicked and signed the lengthy modification agreement that same day, the document was in small print but at that time I believed that the outcome could not be worse then the original modification because BofA was there to help and would be fair to consumers. Especially the fact that I have been a loyal customer with them for the past 30 plus years. 

The modification was completed in XXXX, XXXX. When I made the first payment, I then realized the loan had a principal balance of {$200000.00} instead of the original principal balance of {$140000.00}, plus a new balloon payment of {$140000.00}, and the remaining loan term of 20 plus years became 39 years. Interest remained the same as the previous modification of 2 % adjustable every few years. My monthly payment was {$100000.00} before the modification, now it is {$1000.00}. 

I called BofA several times, the first XXXX representatives were very impatient and told me I had signed the modification agreement and I was aware it was a new loan because of prior modifications, that there is nothing I can do. I was never informed that it would be a new loan, the document I signed stated it was a Modification Agreement. I was never informed of the new terms until the document for signatures was sent to me. I called BofA again in XXXX, XXXX asking them to see if someone of authority at their bank can look over my modification, because owing {$14000.00} does not warrant added principal of over {$67000.00} plus a balloon payment of over {$140000.00}. I called the XXXX program, they told me to get a break down of the charges from BofA. I asked BofA for a break down, they gave me an explanation of how the last balloon payment of about {$54000.00} plus the late mortgage and penalties was added to that first deferred balloon payment and moved to the original principal, making the upfront principal over {$200.00}. But the break down of the new balloon payment of XXXX is not available to me. They would not or could not give that break down to me. 

I have paid 14 years into the home since XXXX, I do not want to prolong the terms to another 39 years, I can not live that long and I do not want to leave a mess for my children to handle. Now the property is under water because of the added principal and new balloon payment, the market value is only about {$320000.00}, now I owe more than {$350000.00} - more than {$200000.00} in debt than what I owe a few months ago. I am in poor health, I can not handle the stress to be in a worse financial situation than before and to have all my hard earned equity wiped out. I feel like I walked into a trap of disguise that BofA was there to help. I want to receive proof that Bank of America is the owner of my mortgage debt, I want to receive a written break down of how the increased principal and the balloon payment are consist of, I want to reverse the modification or amend it to a reasonable amount based on the nine months ' late payment and late fees."
Mortgage,"We had a Mortgage with Bank of America and in XXXX we negotiated a short-sale with them and had a cash buyer for {$130.00}. We had submitted all the hardship letters, bank statement etc to the bank and everything was agreed for the short sale to proceed. Bank of America in their efforts to close this sale took myself and husband off the Title - we never signed anything with them to do this. There was a problem with the Title and the cash buyer we had walked away from the property after waiting for 6 months to get possession of the property. We were notified via a Court document that we no longer had any legal rights to the property Because of this we were unable to do another short-sale or anything with the property. We spent many frustrating hours on the phone with Bank of America trying to get this matter rectified. We spoke to every department sent letters and emails to no avail. I spoke to deed in lieu department and they told me I could not do a deed in lieu because we were not on the title. 

In XXXX our loan was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. They contacted us to find out what was going on with the mortgage. I explained the situation to them. They said they would look into the matter and see if we could do a deed in lieu. I asked the representative that I was working with if there were be any consequences in doing this with them and he said no they would just take the property back and we would be done with it. I heard back from XXXX XXXX stating that their attorney came back with the title report and advised that myself and my husband were not on the title to the home. There was a court ruling that took our names off the title back in XXXX - as stated above we never signed any court documents with Bank of America. XXXX XXXX also states that the previous servicer, however, never released the lien and reported the transfer complete. They stated that we did not have to sign any further documentation with them. 

Our credit report were severally affected by all of this and I asked XXXX XXXX if they could clear our credit reports. Their reply was there may be a way to have the credit reporting fixed so the loan does not show up after you and your husband were taken off the title in XXXX. They asked us to draft a letter giving an overview of the situation starting with our hardship up to dealing with the Bank of America and trying to get this sorted out. They said once they received this letter, my supervisor and I will take it to our Vice President and get working on fixing the credit. They did fix our credit. Clearly they could see from the documentation sent to them that we had a case. 

I received a XXXX stating that we were personally liable for {$140000.00} which I am now expected to pay taxes on. I sent an email to the person I have been dealing with at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my understanding was that after talking to you that this debt would be forgiven once you cleaned up the title. I asked him at the time we spoke on the phone what were the repercussions of you taking this property back and itw as stated that there would be none "" we will take it back and it will just go away. It was never disclosed to me that we would be personally liable for the debt. 

I have left 3 messages for XXXX XXXX to call me back and none of my calls have been returned nor do I have an answer on my email that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called XXXX XXXX customer service division today and spent an hour on the phone with various people all stating that they can do nothing about this. How can we be personally liable for a debt when we do not own the house? We had a clear agreement with the Bank of America back in XXXX for a short-sale that they messed up - and they took us off the title leaving us with no recourse. 

I do not know who owned the house after Bank of America took us off the title or why they could not complete the short-sale but I do not believe we are personally liable for anything on a property we did not own"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2020 I received a letter from Bank of America confirming my payment postponement ( Forbearance plan re : covid 19 ) for my home loan # XXXX until XX/XX/2020. 
I received a bill in XXXX stating that payment was due for XX/XX/2020. I called customer service who told me that sometimes the bill crosses in the mail as the forbearance letter is issued. She confirmed that the loan was postponed and the next payment is due XX/XX/2020. 
Today I received a bill stating {$4100.00}, I am 47 days delinquent and if my account is not brought current to include fees my home was in jeopardy of going into foreclosure. 
Please confirm the bill dated XX/XX/2020 is incorrect. Please confirm my account reflects the correct information regarding the forbearance. Confirm that this is not inaccurately reported to the credit reporting agencies as past due."
Mortgage,"Every day I receive harassing phone calls from Bank of America, Collections Dept. regarding when I will send in my mortgage payment. According to my mortgage agreement my payment is due the first of each month and late after XX/XX/XXXX. I make the payment between the XXXX - XXXX of each month. I want all harassing calls from BoA to stop now!"
Mortgage,"After losing my job in 2010, I applied to my mortgage holder Bank of America for a modification of my existing mortgage. After months of applications, I finally received a letter from BOA denying my modification because, to my surprise, I was informed, by BOA, in writing, that my mortgage was paid in full. 
Naturally, I immediately called their Customer Service Department and was given the run around that denied the validity of the letter they sent me. However, they refused to send me a letter in writing denying the letter 's validity. I have been informed in the past that when financial institutions make similar 'mistakes ', the institutions themselves are responsible and must suffer the loss."
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX I had a home mortgage with Bank of America ( {$300000.00} ). In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed for bankruptcy. At this time, BOA sold this mortgage to XXXX. I had this mortgage re-certified with XXXX during the bankruptcy. Never missed ANY payments, loan was never in default either with BOA or XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, BOA filed or claimed that my mortgage was delinquent and in collections at the sum of {$330000.00}? This information is reflected on my XXXX credit report as a "" Collection Account ''. This false information affects my credit status, my credit score and is incorrect. I believe BOA filed my old mortgage, with ( fraud ) the government and reported my mortgage to the Feds to be reimbursed under the banking "" bailout '' policies at the time. I need to have this discrepancy removed from my credit file and BOA needs to be investigated for fraud."
Mortgage,"Started in XXXX when I purchased my XXXX home. In late XXXX XXXX I lost my job. I made every attempt to get help with my mortgage from Bank of America with no luck. XXXX I filed for bankruptcy in attempt to get out from under the house. It was discharged early in XXXX. Late in XXXX Bank of America took possession of the house with no notice or warning and did not foreclose on the property. I thought this was a normal course of action as this was my XXXX home and bankruptcy. Fast forward to late XXXX I am served with a summons to appear in court for HOA Fees on the home that I had n't been in for over 4 years. I tell the HOA there must be some mistake since the bank owns the home. They said contact the bank. I contact Bank of America and they apologize for locking me out and provide the key code so that I can move back in. They say that they will work with me to modify the mortgage after I move back into the property. Once I moved into the property they served me with foreclosure paperwork. At the mediation I asked for modification, cash for keys, or deed in lieu. They denied all of those things. They continually give me the run around. 
I forgot to mention that not long before the lock out there was a tornado in my area that caused damage to the roof and siding. My insurance cut a check but I never got the repairs since I was locked out. Now I ca n't get insurance on the property until the repairs are made and the insurance will not cut another check. Also, under Bank of Americas watch several pipes burst and caused damage to the home and possible mold. 
So now I have this house in my name that I ca n't do anything with and is causing me more and more money at every turn. I ca n't sell it due to the HOA liens that BOA refuses to help with."
Mortgage,"Uodate on my previous complaint : According to Superior Court of California dated XX/XX/XXXX my proproperty was never sold and a mortgage was never opened by anyone except me in XX/XX/XXXX. Please refer to case information XXXX XXXX for "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. Please see Register of  Actions. 
I was evicted and can not stay in my home. Please have the sheriff or appropriate government official give me possession of my home. There are squattters/people living in my home and making illiegal alterations to my home now."
Mortgage,"Good afternoon, hope all is well ... I have tried to get the bank to remove this off my credit report ... According the them we were late on our payments for over a year, which is not correct we have made every payment on time, anyway they end up selling to another lender whom we have also never been late with ... please if you could remove this from my credit report, it is Home loan services account # XXXX ... thank you in advance. XXXX,"
Mortgage,"Since XX/XX/2015 Bank of America has refused to remove a XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX HELOC lien on my property. I had two similarly situated properties and the HELOC lien was properly satisfied on XXXX parcel, pursuant to a settlement with the US Federal Justice Department see : XXXX : XXXX. They promised to release the other HELOC and I submitted the documents they requested. They did not release it or provide a written reason for their refusal. They told me to call some XXXX # for a company I've never done business with and is not on my title. 

Bank of America has not only refused to provide the satisfaction, they have responded to letters from my lawyers by providing confidential credit card account statements for a "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( no relation ). Poor Mr. XXXX, Bank of America has update his credit card account to MY LAW FIRM 'S address?? Not once, but twice - after my lawyers expressly advised them of the error. This utterly is inexcusable! 

Bank of America 's inaction in removing the cloud on my title severely impairs my property rights. I have expended considerable financial resources to resolve this matter but XXXX XXXX to XXXX Bank of America, refuses to provide even the courtesy of a reply."

I Have been leaving several Messages since there response and no one has returned my phone calls."
Mortgage,"My husband and I recieved a mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX from Bank Of America to purchase our home. Because of the price it required 2 mortgages, One was a balloon mortgage due in 10 years ( XX/XX/XXXX ). We never missed a payment on either note, When the balloon note was due we just assumed they would refinance it for us as we could not pay it off at that time. They would not refinance because the value of our home decreased. I called BOA for advice and was turned over to their debt collection department. I was told to do a loan modification but to keep making the payments on the loan. We sent in 3 payments which were returned to us and was told pay the balance or nothing. I did as the my account manager asked, sending in documents regarding our income etc, For a period of 5 months I dealt with several different personal account managers and underwriters. Nearly every week the account managers would call and say that the underwriters wanted more information about our finances etc. Just when I was told that was probably it, the account manager would call back the next week with more questions from the underwriter. All this went on from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This caused us to be in default on the payments of 5 months! We did finally get the loan modification but at a higher monthly payment and interest rate. I was told in the beginning the monthly payments and interest rate would be lower. 
BOA sold our first mortgage a few years ago to XXXX but BOA retained the balloon mortgage. We asked XXXX ( now XXXX XXXX ) if they would combine the 2 mortgages and at a fixed rate. ( The mortgages we have are not at a fixed rate. ) We were denied because of the missed 5 payments to BOA. We are both in our XXXX and even if we tried to sell our home now it would have to be a "" short sale ''. Not something we want to do at this point in our sunset years. 
We feel these missed payments were not our fault. The BOA underwriters did not have their act together in my opinion. There was no reason this loan modification could not have been done in a few weeks not 5 months! I would appreciate it if BOA would issue us forgiveness for the missed payments and report this forgiveness to the credit bureau."
Mortgage,"I have had my mortgage loan through Bank of America since XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was for mortgage only not including escrow. The escrow has always been paid by me.. In XX/XX/XXXX I paid my taxes in four installments I was on my last quarter when Bank of America decided to make the last payment at the same time I was paying it. The city took the Bank of America check and they returned my check. I right away called Bank of America as to why they had done that and they apologized and said that if I pay the fourteen hundred something back to them that they would take away the escrow from account. I continue to paid my original {$700.00} mortgage payment and paid off the escrow they had paid. But they continue to add the mortgage and escrow, I had called them to see what was going on as to why they were still adding the escrow amount to my account when I have always paid my escrow on my own they could not give me answer. I still continue to just pay the {$700.00}. This past year I paid the full amount of the taxes in full four thousand something to the city. I called Bank of America to take off the escrow amount out of my account that I had paid the city the escrow.They had asked me to send them a copy of the receipt which I did. Then said they will take it off and from now on I would only paying the {$740.00} this started XX/XX/XXXX. So the coupon on the statement says {$740.00} but at the top of the top of statement they have Total amount I owe of {$6000.00}. They send several letters to have my mortgage modified, something I do n't want to do because I have not faltered on the account or have not missed any payments. It was Bank of America that screwed up and now they want me to pay penalties and for not agreeing for them to pay the escrow when I have always paid it on my own since XX/XX/XXXX. I 've called them several times to try and get this straighten out but to no eval they continue to add they escrow to the account.."
Mortgage,"We are in the process of doing a short sale with Bank of america. We have submitted all paperwork and understood because it was a VA loan that it had to be denied for a loan modification before are offer for a short sale could be considered. I have recently moved out with my significant other and our baby girl and have been maintaining the property and our realtor had the lockbox on the door in order to show the property to potential back up offers for a short sale. Bank of America sent safe guard properties into the and drilled out all the locks on the doors and replaced them with their own, they damaged the front screen door, and posted signs all over the house. It has greatly diminished the value of the home and the look of the property. They are making us jump through all sorts of hoops now to get keys to the property and will not return the lockbox they destroyed or provide compensation for it and the screen door they broke. The bank is saying they have every right to enter the premises and do what they did, which is completely illegal."
Mortgage,"Have tried numerous times beginning in XX/XX/2017 to seek help with keeping my home through Keep your home California only to be stonewalled by Bank of America as they ask me to apply again and again. I have done so and provided any and all info they requested and done everything they asked only to, be denied again. I am newly divorced and on XXXX but do have income required. I am beyond Exasperated. I believe they are trying to force me to give up my home aka short sale. Help"
Mortgage,"I have a received a note of sale on our property. I sent out a written request to our servicer Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, 2016. During the course of XXXX/XXXX/16 to XXXX we have been in contact with B of A and they allowed us to complete an application in order to move forward with a possible modification. Their was a request for the sale to post-pone on XXXX but it has not gone forward due to the under writer review. I am still waiting for the response of the written request sent out regarding incorrect timeline. I was told by the legal department that is what they should be reviewing. Need your help with this matter."
Mortgage,I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a XXXX in the private sector and XXXX at the XXXX in XXXX XXXX California. I am a XXXX for the XXXX. Six years ago I asked both the Bank of America and XXXX XXXX for a loan to finance XXXX XXXX to help with the Affordable Care Act. Both banks denied the loan several times. We asked these banks because we have accounts with them and the Bank of America held the mortgage until they sold it to XXXX. In 2014 we obtained a Mortgage Modification and now have a subordinate loan to HUD for XXXX. The Bank of America broke the law by hiding our monthly payments and giving false information to the Credit Bureau. They put the lien on our property and made it impossible for us to use the equity in our home to get a loan. I need urgent help to survive this injustice initiated by the Bank of America and now continued by HUD.
Mortgage,"I entered in to a Mortgage loan agreement with Bank of America , NA in XX/XX/XXXX, 2 years later I was notified XX/XX/XXXX that I was XXXX. I was a XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and requested the SCRA Protection on all of my pre-service obligations with Bank of America several times of the 9 year period I continually XXXX XXXX as defined under the SCRA military service. I was denied the SCRA provisions on all of my accounts with Bank of America , NA and had adverse credit reports filed with all of the Credit Reporting Agencies from XX/XX/XXXX and it has Continued to the present. My mortgage loan account number ending in XXXX was charged interest in excess of 6 % until XX/XX/XXXX, I paid everything amount that had been demanded of me, I struggled at times due to the increasing amount charged to all of my accounts. Bank of America controlled my military pay and when all my payments would be applied to my accounts with them and all of my other creditors, this resulted in late fee, over draft fees, return check fees and I never knew what my balance would be from one day to the next. I was constantly dealing with the threats of Foreclosure on the home in XXXX, XXXX were my family lived, and I was offered payment modifications to reduce the amount required, but Bank of America wanted me to sign documents stating that I had defaulted on the mortgage and was financially unable to make my payments, to be considered for a reduced payment plan. I worked XXXX job and preformed all my military duties for 3 years, just so that I could do what I to do for my family and continued to make the payments demanded, and I never agreed to a modification until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, but when I checked in with my XXXX, I was dropped from XXXX, my pay stopped after XXXX and I XXXX just to have a pay check while I was waiting to XXXX. I had to call Bank of America and explain that I was n't being paid, I was offered a loan that was not a modification of my original XXXX mortgage loan. It was explained as a separate loan to cover the payment amount needed and would be billed separately, it was called a Home Saver Loan, I had it mailed to the house in XXXX and it was XX/XX/XXXX and I had n't been paid, so I drove down to sign the document the day before I was going to XXXX. It seemed to be just as it was explained over the phone and I was n't going to leave my kids in a Foreclosure situation while I was in XXXX. I had activated my XXXX when I finally got paid and I made my XXXX mortgage payment online, a few days later I got a call informing me that a Notice of Intent to Accelerate was sent to my home under a XXXX loan number. I called Bank of America and was told that my mortgage was fine, my payment was applied and my loan was still being processed, then a Debt Verification letter was sent with the XXXX mortgage number, stated XXXX owned our mortgage loan, and then a letter from Bank of America dated XX/XX/XXXX said our XXXX mortgage was being transferred for servicing to Bank of America Home Loan. I was in XXXX processing for XXXX and that was the first time I was informed about the Foreclosure on XXXX Servicemembers, and the pattern that it had taken, so we started filing complaints with any Agency we could think of, we met with a JAG Attorney, disputed the XXXX mortgage debt and XXXX legal right to collect payments from us. Our XXXX Mortgage history was gone, everything had been replaced with the XXXX mortgage account, which only went back to XX/XX/XXXX. We were advised that any payment to the XXXX is seen as an agreement!"
Mortgage,"My current loan to value ( LTV ) ratio of my mortgage is "" at or below 80 % '' according to my bank. The equity that I have paid into my mortgage is about 22 % now. However, my bank wo n't cancel my private mortgage insurance ( PMI ). I 've never had a late payment in the almost XXXX years that I have had this mortgage. This costs me {$140.00} per month."
Mortgage,"XXXX principal payments were transferred from my personal account in house with bank of America to my mortgage account. Each time while on automatic payment for my loan, they have taken another payment with interest. Now for whatever reason for2 weeks I can not speak with them they just keep putting me on hold!"
Mortgage,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : I am a Super Storm Sandy survivor. My primary home is located in XXXX, New Jersey and was substantially damaged. Bank of America proceeded with a wrongful foreclosure on my home. 

Heres a summary of the facts : I am currently renting in XXXX, NJ. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I applied for Mortgage Forbearance certification from the State of New Jersey. 
XX/XX/XXXX denied certification due not having my complete FEMA file ; Please note my attorneys and myself request my complete file history from FEMA multiple times since XXXX as I needed it for other related issues. FEMA delayed and finally sent my file in late XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX attorney appeal submitted for Mortgage Forbearance certification XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America, who is my XXXX XXXX   mortgage servicer, proceeded with foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX - I finally received State Forbearance Certification after an appeal due to extensive FEMA delays XX/XX/XXXX - the NJ Department of Consumer Affairs forwards my mortgage certification to Bank of America representative ( XXXX XXXX ) ( see attachment ) ; shortly afterwards, my attorney submits the Mortgage Forbearance certification to the foreclosure attorneys representing Bank of America ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ) Bank of America + attorneys continued to ignore my State certification they did not even acknowledge receipt Note : Bank of America failed to work with me before foreclosing on my property as any loan notices for assistance were sent to the damaged property instead of my mailing address. In BOAs reply to my prior CFPB complaint, the Bank only provided documents showing the property address ; there is no proof these documents were even mailed. These failed attempts contributed to my loss XX/XX/XXXX, a Motion for Stay of Foreclosure was denied XX/XX/XXXX, final judgement was issued against me XX/XX/XXXX, Subsequently, Bank of America issued a letter indicating "" approved for mortgage forbearance '' for the period XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. BOA never acknowledged the forbearance issued by State of New Jersey which would have been more beneficial to me since it would have been for a longer time period, ending XX/XX/XXXX. 
Bank of America delayed approx. 5 months before indicating that I was placed in their own forbearance plan. It appears their special forbearance plan was based on XXXX XXXX new guidelines issued for Hurricane Survivors. 
XX/XX/XXXX, As Bank of America continued with foreclosure, they proceeded with a sheriff sale ; it appears this was rescheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, probably due to my complaints filed with the NJ DOBI and the CFPB as noted below. 
Note : Since XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America held approx. $ 40K of  insurance proceeds in escrow from my insurance claim which took 4 years to settle in court. They denied any payment to me/builder even though XXXX XXXX guidelines stated in an effort to continue helping Super Storm survivors, 25 % can be paid out to a borrower/contractor ; this should have been paid out even before any foreclosure issues began. Requests have been submitted but ignored. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The DOBI complaint was forwarded to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency but I have yet to receive a response. The CFPB complaint ( # XXXX ) was quickly responded within 2 days by Bank of America but their reply was an inaccurate picture of what their representatives stated to me via several phone calls as noted below."
Mortgage,"After my mortgage was sold to Bank of America from XXXX, my husbans lost his job in XXXX. We filed bankruptcy XXXX of XXXX and included this loan. It was discharged XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, Bank of America sold my mortgage to XXXX as a loan modification. Knowing that our bankruptcy was finalized and discharged in XXXX. Now, 4 years later, we are unable to purchase a house because XXXX had our names on this property until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. How can a financial institute sell your mortgage after a discharge?"
Mortgage,"Company : Bank of America Date : XX/XX/2020 Person ( s ) Involved : XXXX ( NMLS # XXXX & XXXX XXXX ) Issue : Pretextual Discriminatory Mortgage Policies in XXXX & Low Income Areas : Bank of America has internal policies and procedures that essentially excludes millions of potential homeowners through discriminatory policies : The policy indicates that properties in certain areas, a XXXX credit score is required. 

I inquired about a relatively inexpensive property of XXXX of which XXXX said 25-30 % would be required. I have the 30 % available in my checking account now and a XXXX score according to XXXX XXXX, yet XXXX indicated I have a of XXXX score. That said, XXXX immediately refused to provide alternatives or options and consistently demonstrated his unprofessional behavior for a BOA customer of 17 years. 

The Bank of America policy of XXXX or above credit scores seems quite discriminatory in that the particular area has the following factors : XXXX very low income, 2.a distressed area, 3. predominately XXXX and 4. public search indicates that a low percentage of people in that area have a XXXX or above credit score and state would qualify to purchase an investment or regular residential property. I cite discrimination based on the above factors. It essentially excludes the potential for home ownership. 

This policy excludes the potential for new XXXX and XXXX homeowners and landlords interested in rental properties. 

I have checked XXXX  and XXXX  and I have a score of XXXX in both cases. Even still, the analyst I spoke knows that I have 100 % on time payments and a 30 % down payment available. Will a XXXX person always be prevented from being landlord or investment owner based on pretextual policies put forth by BOA? 

How can the complaint be satisfactorily addressed? 
Implementation of Non-Discriminatory Mortgage and Finance Packages and options. Providing alternatives."
Mortgage,"In XXXX, I was in the process of a FHA Modification with Bank of America. I hired an attorney, attended a seminar to meet account specialists, and complied with whatever was needed in order to obtain the modification and remain in my home. During the trial period of the modification, Bank of America placed a recorded a lien with XXXX XXXX register of deeds in XX/XX/XXXX and sold the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX which then sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Once again, a trial period was demanded with a down payment of {$10000.00} following trial period of {$2500.00} each month. Consequently the loan was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to sell my home and learned about the partial subordinate lien ( second mortgage ) placed by Bank of America. 
I reached out to Hud and was informed the case number does not exist. After several attempt to register in the XXXX  Portal, I had one person respond via the XXXX XXXX chat that the Bank of America recorded a lien but never filed a clam with HUD. I was also inform to contact my primary servicer and to inquire if they will file a claim if not it can be released. I have reached out several times and I do not get any replies. 
I would appreciate help from anyone at this time"
Mortgage,"I HAVE REQUESTED AND APPEALED TO MY MORTGAGE LENDER ( BANK OF AMERICA ) TO PLEASE CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE ABOUT EVALUATING MY LOAN MODIFICATION APPLICATION BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE REPEATEDLY!! 
The lender approved my trial loan modification but then they refused to turn this offer into a permanent plan!!!! They claim that they can not verify my tax returns from 6 years ago!!!!!, i.e. XXXX and XXXX. This is an absolute false claim from B of A because I have presented all the tax returns for every single year that they requested, including XXXX & XXXX. 
I even gave them official transcripts DIRECTLY from IRS, confirming that I DID file taxes for all the years disputed by B of A. 

So I have all kinds of proofs that my tax filing history is correct and accurate. But the lender keeps repeating a false claim and a baseless assumption with no proofs whatsoever!!!! 
They keep repeating their wrong information regarding events of 6 years ago!!!! 
This behavior is both unreasonable and very unfair. I have solid proofs of my tax filings which I have repeatedly presented to them. Yet they keep repeating the same false assumptions!!!"
Mortgage,"I have a mortgage with Bank of America which I am attempting to refinance with XXXX XXXX. I previously had my mortgage deferred while I was partially laid off due to COVID-19. When I attempted to refinance my mortgage with XXXX XXXX, they told me that I needed to cancel my deferred payments plan and pay off the deferred balance. I called Bank of America over 15 times and visited their XXXX branch twice starting on XX/XX/XXXX asking for assistance in paying off my deferred balance and canceling my deferred payment plan but I still have not been helped. Bank of America is intentionally sabotaging my refinance by providing false information and now allowing me to make payments towards my deferred balance which I have been attempting to pay since XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2020 I called Bank of America at XXXX and was on hold for 2 hours. Finally I spoke with an associate at XXXX who helped me transfer a previous payment of {$3500.00} towards my deferred balance. In the same call, he also helped me make an additional payment of {$3300.00} to completely pay off my deferred balance. At XXXX this Bank of America representative stated that I had closed out the deferred payment plan and had paid off the deferred forbearance balance. This rep provided the following confirmation number that the deferred balance had been closed out : Confirmation # XXXX. The rep confirmed that the deferred balance would disappear from my account by the following day. This representative also submitted a request to his manager to ensure the forbearance was closed out. On XX/XX/2020 XXXX I spoke with XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America complaints specialist ) asking if I could have proof that the deferred payment plan was canceled. She stated that she would request this and that it could take up to 2 days to receive the letter. Between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I called and emailed Bank XXXX as well as her manager asking for assistance but I still did not get any resolution. On XX/XX/2020 XXXX told me that my deferred balance had NOT been paid off and that she still was unable to get me proof of my deferred payment plan cancelation. She told me that I would need to make yet another payment of {$3600.00} online under the "" other payments '' tab which I did. 

Given that Bank of America was refusing to allow me to pay of my forbearance, I filed a complaint against them with the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2020 ( refer to XXXX  case # XXXX ). On XX/XX/2020 XXXX  closed the complaint without Bank of America providing me with a formal response. XXXX  stated the following : "" Bank of America has indicated its agreement to diligently work in the resolution of your complaint which you filed with XXXX  on XX/XX/2020. Bank of America has indicated their intentions of contacting you regarding your complaint ( or has already done so ) and is working to resolve the issue in a prompt manner. It is our hope that a fair and reasonable resolution may be achieved by allowing open communication to continue between you and Bank of America. '' On XX/XX/2020 I received a formal letter stating that Bank of America had canceled my deferred payment plan. I received a legal letter from Bank of America 's regulatory complaints specialist named XXXX XXXX who stated that she would be my sole point of contact at Bank of America. Other associates have refused to help me since the XXXX  complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a payoff statement from Bank of America in the amount of {$700000.00} with the deferred balance removed from my account. 

I called XXXX numerous times on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX inquiring about the deferred balance but she did not answer. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX she called me only to tell me that she was working on my case but that she could not guarantee that I can pay off my deferred balance. I mentioned that a previous Bank of America employee not only took payment and told me that I had paid it off but he also provided me with a confirmation number for this transaction. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another payoff statement from Bank of America in the amount of {$710000.00} with the deferred balance added back to my account and termed an "" uncollected fee due '' of {$6800.00}. This is further proof that Bank of America is both providing false information and actively sabotaging my refinance with XXXX XXXX."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is reporting an inaccurate account on my credit report. They are stating on my credit report that an account was included in bankruptcy on XXXX XXXX, 2012 when my bankruptcy was filed on XXXX XXXX, 2012. I sent them a dispute letter to verify all this information and it was ignored. I disputed with the credit bureaus to get this account updated as well and they continue to report the inaccurate information."
Mortgage,"I recently submitted a complaint ( number XXXX ) regarding mortgage issues with Bank of America. A representative called me on XXXX XXXX or XXXX, in regards to the complaint, and during that conversation, the representative started laughing at me and my situation. This is now the person who they have assigned to assist me with my mortgage. Also, during that conversation, ( after the representative started laughing at me ), I asked to speak with his supervisor. I was told she was not available, but that she would call me back in 30 minutes. The supervisor did call me back, and was helpful, sort of. She explained that she would be sending me some documents, and would call me back on Friday XXXX XXXX at XXXX. ( her name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. We set up an appointment for her to call me. She never called me. I called her at about XXXX XXXX and received her voicemail. This seems typical of Bank of America as I have been dealing with them on trying to get a loan modification XX/XX/XXXX. They keep saying they are sending out documents, and they never do. I spoke to them back XX/XX/XXXX and was told they would be sending the documents. I also requested the documents multiple times in XXXX and XXXX as I had regular bi-weekly phone calls scheduled with my "" dedicated account representative. '' These dedicated account representative has indicated on my account that I was unresponsive and Bank of America has now placed my home in foreclosure after they refused/returned my payment to them to bring my mortgage current and up to day. They are now making me pay additional fees totaling {$450.00} + potential escrow fees + the amount of money I sent to them XXXX which they refused ) in order to remove the foreclosure status of my loan. They are also requiring that I send my payment in certified funds or a money order, which of course costs additional money, plus they only gave me 4 days to get the payment to them and require it be sent overnight express mail, which also costs additional money. They really are not looking out for people who are struggling to pay their mortgage and are doing what everyone says to do, and that is stay in contact with your mortgage company and attempt to make arrangements to pay. Bank of America does not follow through with what they say they are going to do, and in the mean time, when consumers are doing what they say they can do, Bank of America puts your home in foreclosure. There are many websites that warn consumers to be aware of scams ... .well, I think Bank of America should be added to the list of scam artists."
Mortgage,"Our firm, XXXX XXXX, XXXX has been monitoring our client 's request for mortgage assistance to Bank of America to ensure its compliance with Regulation X. During the past few months, we have run into several issues while our client continues to try to get her loan modified by Bank of America. This will be the third CFPB complaint we 've had to file pertaining to this mortgage loan. The borrower submitted a Loss Mitigation Application to Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX via facsimile transmission. We emailed an exact copy to Bank of America 's prior counsel at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) on XX/XX/XXXX at the specific request of XXXX to direct any and all loss mitigation communication to their office only and not to send anything directly to the bank. Pursuant to a letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX, there was no foreclosure sale scheduled as of XX/XX/XXXX according to Bank of America. 

As discussed in our previous complaints, we continued to have issues with Bank of America throughout the review process, including the borrower 's home being set for foreclosure sale while the active review was still pending. The evaluation of the borrower 's application was finally completed and she was offered a trial modification plan on XX/XX/XXXX, which was sent to our firm by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( "" XXXX '' ), Bank of America 's foreclosure counsel. Due to the lack of information provided in the offer letter, the borrower asked that we request some additional details about the trial offer. Since it has been very difficult to get anyone on the phone at Bank of America to discuss the borrower 's loan account, we reached out to XXXX via email with our client 's questions. After receiving no response from XXXX, we also submitted a Request for Information via US Certified Mail to Bank of America 's designed address for such correspondence. We still have n't received any additional information pertaining to the terms of the proposed modification. 

Despite the foregoing, the borrower sent her first trial period payment pursuant to the terms of the offer letter via US Priority Express Mail on XX/XX/XXXX, which Bank of America received on XX/XX/XXXX. Even though our client made her first payment and Bank of America received the payment before the stated due date ( i.e. XX/XX/XXXX ), our client 's home remains set to be sold at foreclosure auction on XX/XX/XXXX. The borrower has called the clerks office several times and was informed that there has n't been any efforts made by Bank of America to cancel or move the sale date. We also reached out to XXXX regarding the upcoming sale and we were told that Bank of America has not given any instruction to postpone the sale date. 

Moreover, we continue to have trouble trying to contact Bank of America in connection with the borrower 's loan. Every time we try to call, we get an automated message about technical difficulties and then the call is disconnected. This has been happening for several months now. Recently, we can only reach a live person by using a different client 's loan number and then asking the representative to subsequently pull up this particular loan once we have someone on the line."
Mortgage,"I am trying to start the process to "" recast '' my mortgage. I have been on the "" Making Homes Affordable '' program for the last 5 years*. The BofA sent me a notice that a "" recast '' was available if we wanted to keep our mortgage payment at a lower level, who would n't? 
I missed the deadline for getting the notarized paper work back to them. 
I called the help phone number, XXXX, ( on XX/XX/2016 ) to see if I could send the request in late. I was asked to hold while the agent checked to see if they would send me new forms. 
I was told to check back on a daily basis to see if my request had been granted. I called back ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and was told to hold, the agent checked and told me to call back as no decision had been made. 
I had been through this dodge before with XXXX XXXX. I was going to call back this morning to check again. Then I thought the best thing to do was contact CFPB. 
*You helped me before when BofA reported me 90 days overdue. With that incident I requested a posting printout from them and found XXXX major problems 1. they were posting my payments to "" Unapplied Cash ''. 2. They showed XXXX or XXXX transactions to my account but the "" dump '' showed XXXX. 
I have other problems with them but I will not bother you with them now.

Mortgage,"During COVID Bank of America offered a forbearance. I asked that if I used it would the payments be put at the end of my mortgage. I was told yes over the phone. I received letters stating you owe such and such amount. I would call and ask and was given the reply that yes I was on a forbearance and would not have to pay until the end of my mortgage. This would happen about every three months. The forbearance was up in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I resumed payments. From what I had been told I was sure the payments I was making were for the months I was making them in. 
I called when I saw online that my current payments were being used towards the XXXX payments that had been in forbearance. When I asked why that was as I had been told they were going to be put at the back end of the mortgage I was told that things had changed. They are now telling me I have to come up with all the money or they can foreclose on my house! 
This seems criminal to me. Had I been told that in the first place I would have borrowed money rather than use their forebearance plan. They have been charging me XXXX % interest rate as it is which seems like usury. I am not a young person and Im on Social Security. I dont know any place where I could get a new mortgage at this point. Please help. I just want them to put the payments at the back end of the mortgage like they told me they were going to do.Thank you"
Mortgage,"InXX/XX/XXXX, you requested your bank to pay your taxes from your escrow account. 
The bank only paid half of the tax bill, leaving you with a remaining balance. 
In XX/XX/, you realized that you were delinquent on your taxes and contacted the bank to pay the past due balance. 
The bank paid the past due balance and the penalty fee associated with it. 
The bank refuses to refund you the penalty fee because they claim that their negligence was not the reason for the penalty. 
I believe that the penalty would have been avoided if the bank had paid the tax bill in full like you requested earlier in the year."
Mortgage,"Bank of America was the mortgage holder for the commercial property owned by XXXX XXXX, a company I held the majority share in. We sold the property and BoA had released the lien and escrow had been closed. Then on XX/XX/2020, BoA charged XXXX XXXX termination penalty fee of {$95000.00} without my consent. Additionally, on XX/XX/2020, BoA locked me out of access to both my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and my XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts per a minority shareholders request without any official approval from the companies meeting minutes, etc."
Mortgage,"We sent in a Loan Modification application on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to the lender, Bank of America. at that time, they had a sale date scheduled. we requested a postponement to allow a review and it was pushed out to XXXX/XXXX/15. we waiting for over XXXX weeks to get an update, calling weekly, only to be dropped into the voicemail of a XXXX XXXX who was the assigned SPOC. he never returned our called. we sent in updated documents on XXXX/XXXX/15 along with a Notice of Error, QWR, and Demand for Response - XXXX Days. As a result, the sale date for XXXX/XXXX/15 was canceled. we continued to call for an update and were told on XXXX and XXXX by different agents that the file was in review and no docs were needed and there was no sale date set. We received a letter from the Counsel for BOA on XXXX/XXXX/15 that there was a new sale date set for XXXX/XXXX/15. we sent another Notice of Error citing that BOA told us the file was complete and in review so no new sale date should have been set without explanation or cause. on XXXX/XXXX/15, we spoke to XXXX XXXX who stated that the file was incomplete since XXXX/XXXX/15 and that he called XXXX times. the number he called was out of service, which he acknowledged. he knew we were the counsel for the borrower and I asked if he had our number. he said he did but that "" we do n't have to call you if we do n't want to ''. we were floored by this attitude and lack of consideration. he also said the file was closed on XXXX/XXXX/15, XXXX day after we were told the file was complete and in XXXX review. as of today, we have sent in all of the requested documents BOA claims were requested, they were faxed and email on XXXX and XXXX for good measure. this is a gross mismanagement of the review and Loan Mod process and we insist that the sale be postponed and/or canceled to allow for a proper review."
Mortgage,"Bank of America processed a  Loan Modificatio n in   XXXX   XXXX     with my ex husband  ( borrow er ) without notification to myself or my signature. There is no divorce decree or property division giving my ex husband sole decision making on the loan, yet BoA allowed for only him to be the decision maker on the loan mod. BoA processed the loan with only ex husband signature, stating him as "" Borrower, '' but not myself. I attempted to have BoA remove me from the loan obligation as it was processed as fraud, and was declined. I am filing this complaint because of fraudulent financial practices to process the loan modification. It is a fraudulent practice to process loan mods quickly and not seeking the signature of all parties."
Mortgage,"I have been try to get mortgage loan assistance for a number of months from Bank of America. They repeatedly ask for information that had been previously provided.

Mortgage,"I bought new house in XXXX, TX area. I and my family were excited for our first home. We were looking around for good lender with great rate. Bank of America is XXXX of them. they come up with plan mentioning that you are eligible for physicIan loan with 3.75 % apr AND You do not need to set up any escrow account for it. I asked their agent-XXXX XXXX multiple times that are you sure that I do not have to set up escrow account? She answered me that I am 1000 percentage sure you do not have to set up escrow account with 10 percentage down. There are few lenders who were providing me similar rate with XXXX loan with no set up of escrow account. XXXX was so aggressive that we will give you best service and everytime my question was similar that are you sure that I do n't have to set up escrow and she is saying that I am very sure. We decided to go with Bank of America looking at her confidence and promise. She sent me closing cost work sheet/good faith estimate without any escrow account as well. I can show to prove her promise. meanwhile, I provided lot of documents for my loans in timely manner whatever processor and underwriter was requesting. There was only 4 working business days remain for closing and she came up on XXXX/XXXX/2015 late afternoon mentioning that we have to now set up escrow account. I made mistake and please forgive me. I was really upset because not setting up escrow account was only reason to go with bank of America. There are other lender providing same rate loan with out escrow. I was really anxious because only 1 wk remained for my closing. I felt cheated as customer by end of day. I can not understand that loan went through different stages before final approval and nobody noticed or informed me about escrow thing until last moment when only 4 days remained so I can not go any where. I would never go with Bank of America if I am aware about that I had to set up escrow. I had different options for not setting up escrow for home loan. I ended up paying additional XXXX for escrow account and now monthly payment that I was not ready for it. I would totally consider it as a fraud and cheating to customer. I believe that it is customer right to get correct information about product whenever they are buying something. INFORM CUSTOMER ABOUT SURPRISE WHEN THEY CAN NOT DO ANYTHING THAT IS MOTTO OF BANK OF AMERICA. 

please help me out with this matter so no one else can get fooled/cheated by them."

From the customer view, it appears that the left hand is not aligned with the right hand and that the head has been cut off! 
Also, on XXXX/XXXX/2016, I requested my payment history from BofA, including the time they allege I missed payments.

Mortgage,"The property address mentioned above was foreclosed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Charged off by Bank of America XXXX. XXXX XXXX was the XXXX lien-holder and tried twice to participate in a short sale, but Bank of America refused twice ; therefore, the home went into foreclosure. 

We made numerous calls to Bank of America who told us the home was charged off and we did n't owe anything. Then we received notice from XXXX saying they had the loan now. We disputed the validity of this debt. XXXX at one time agreed that Bank of America should have never sold this loan to them, but then started charging us the regular monthly payment amout of {$620.00} which has significantly increased this debt. And now XXXX is selling this disputed debt to XXXX and the debt amount has doubled from the original debt amount. 

Additionally, this property was part of the National Federal Class Action Lawsuit against the XXXX banks ( including Bank of America and XXXX XXXX ) that foreclosed on homes and should not have."
Mortgage,"I received information from a Bank of America representative via phone informing me of a forbearance / deferment due to my Covid 19 and Hurricane Ida resulted hardship. I informed the representative that I was working towards catching up on my account. I specifically asked for clarity of the forbearance to ensure I would not have to pay notes occurred during the forbearance at the end of the forbearance. She assured me that those notes would be placed at the end of the mortgage loan period. I had her to repeat to ensure. At the end of my forbearance I was told something different and I am now working on a loan modification. I would have known the correct information, I would have sought out other options. A week ago I was informed by a representative ( XXXX XXXX ) that I needed to send an appeal email requesting information about an outstanding issue. I sent the email immediately and I also sent an appeal email regarding the false information. I informed the representative a week ago that I completed an appeal email regarding the false information I received and still have not received a response. At that time I was informed that I did not need to send an appeal email regarding the information I had just received stating I had an outstanding issue that needed to be addressed. That was again, false information. This is not the first or second time I have sent complaints due to false information from representatives. Bank of America only apologizes and moves on. Unacceptable and not professional at all. I am presently on XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX due to XXXX XXXX  and this situation is only escalating those issues. I have requested that the recorded phone calls be reviewed. Last week, after being told day before that calls would be reviewed, that those calls in questions were not able to be reviewed, yet the representative was able to review several other calls. I am also having difficulties and frustration with representatives during this modification process. They continue to ask for duplicates and information that is noted not retrievable. In particular, after sending several child support check stubs, letter from payor and proof of deposits ( after being told to deposit ), they still continue to ask for evidence that it will continue. On last week I was told that they had a document that showed my payments are XXXX and I have proven otherwise that payments are XXXX XXXX month with several pay stubs and deposits. I am not sure where the errored information came from and the representative could not answer. They were provided everything that could possibly prove receipt and continued payment. After reporting to XXXX, a letter from XXXX noted next steps that were not taken."

Over the last 3 years I have sent an additional payment to be applied against the principal of my home loan four different times, and each time the funds have been credited as future monthly payments rather than towards the paying down of the principal. Each time I must call customer service, wait on hold for 35 min. and then spend another 10 min. getting it sorted out. Each time I have been told that I have done everything correctly in the way the payment was clearly marked "" Principal Only '', and that they do n't know why the "" mistake '' was made in how the funds were applied. Four out of four times is not a mistake, it is a clear pattern. It appears that Bank of America wants to make it difficult for the millions of customers, whose loans they administer, to pay off their home loans early. It must not be in their financial interest to have us do so, but it is our legal right. I have already filed complaints through official BoA channels and sent letters to executives of associated departments. No improvements in 3 years. If they wanted to provide the service they claim to provide, they could easily put the right systems in place. We bailed these greedy cheating folks out in a big way, it is time they were held accountable, time for them to perform as advertised."
Mortgage,"My mortgage is with XXXX XXXX. After finished 18 months of Covid-19 payment deferral, the bank for this mortgage-Bank of America should send me a mortgage modification with 3 trail payments. They did send me one. The response date was XX/XX/XXXX, but I received it later, this date already passed. So I called about the end of the XX/XX/XXXX on number on the letter XXXX. The Customer Service said she will resubmit the case for me, I should receive a letter, but I never got it. So I called back, they did same thing several times. No result. 
At XX/XX/XXXX, I called back again. This time they let me call XXXX, it turns out that I need to submit a Mortgage Modification form. At XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted the form, for my great surprise, I saw my house will be in action at XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX"
Mortgage,I went through a bankruptcy and came out with a negative balance for my insurance and taxes against my home after 5 years with interest. I request a modification and it took close to two years and the loan was only modify by adding the balance back to loan and the rate stayed the same and I ask why the rate stayed the same I was told that the modification was to ketch me up not make it comfortable. My payments was XXXX and thru my trial modification XXXX a month. Now I am asked to pay over XXXX a month. I also found out that a lean was put on my property.
Mortgage,"I already have a complaint  XXXX  on file and it was closed based on the response from Bank of America. They state we filed for Bankruptcy and that 's it. Bankruptcy was closed and the application  for Home Modification ha s taken place AFTER the Bankruptcy, for more than a year we tried to get a modification and BOA just kept stalling and demanding a payment of tens of thousands of dollars to stop the foreclosure during the modification process.

Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX, my mother refinanced her house through Bank of America in XXXX, XXXX. She was XXXX years old. They gave her a 30yr mortgage. After she refinanced, she said XXXX if anything happens to me the house will be paid off. Three months later she passed away.

I do n't think it 's right that they kept the bankruptcy payments, never acted like property was mine or would work with me even though deed was in my name. This was predatory lending.

Mortgage,"Since our previous complaint, we have received no further correspondence from the lender in reference to the issues that are preventing us from obtaining a reasonable offer. The lender insists that they must net {$230000.00} ; however. that amount is determined by a questionable appraisal. Questionable because of the condition of the property. It is in need of {$15000.00} to {$20000.00} worth of repairs. We believe that this appraisal is prejudiced and have asked for a second opinion. None has been provided. The appraisal was at {$270000.00} and was significantly higher than the previous one of {$260000.00}. Again, neither appraisal has accounted for the repairs needed to bring the property to comparative market value. Furthermore, we have ask for a closing costs explanation as to how the net of {$230000.00} was determined. None has been provided. Prospective Buyers have expressed their reluctance to submit an offer since the valuation has been set too high."
Mortgage,"Bank of America erroneously paid my neighbor 's property taxes out of my escrow account.

These parcels do not belong to me and are not listed in my name or at my address.The total of {$2900.00} was misappropriated from my escrow account related to my mortgage. Additionally they raised my mortgage payment to {$950.00} and then to {$1100.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. Ten phone calls later requesting return of the {$2900.00} and reevaluaton of mortgage payment, I have learned that they "" updated '' their information and that my mortgage payment will be {$770.00} per month but not beginning until XXXX XXXX.

Mortgage,"Bank of America has done everything but, review my loan for modification under the federal government 's program with correct information. I filed the modification paperwork with the bank last year. Each time I filed they found some made-up excuse to decline the modification. My last review for modification was successful and they granted me a modification however they used absolutely wrong income to process the modification. Ever since then I have tried my best for them to corrected and they are refusing to do so. The most recent excuse is that they have used my son 's ( who is a non-borrower contributor ) 100 % gross income as my household income because I did not provide them with a contribution letter. That is absolutely false. I provided to the contribution letter to them in XXXX 2016 and since then I have given them everything that they have asked for. I 'm attaching a copy of the contribution letter with this complaint. I 'm asking you to help me correct these numbers so this way to correct modification can be granted and I wo n't lose my home."
Mortgage,"I have a Bank of America home loan that was supposed to close on XXXX XXXX 2016, and that date was guaranteed by BOA 's "" Close on Time '' guarantee. The guarantee states that BOA will pay {$500.00} if they fail to meet the closing date. The Loan Officer at BOA ( XXXX XXXX ) dropped the ball along the way, and as a result, BOA failed to meet the closing date ( though he never explained exactly what he did to cause the delay ). I have the email from XXXX XXXX notifying the title company and the seller 's real estate agent that BOA would not be able to meet the guaranteed closing date. His exact words were, "" I am so sorry but at this time, the closing can not happen on Friday. XXXX is aware of the situation and we are remedying what needs to be fixed. To make it clear, he is not at fault, we are. '' Despite this clear admission of fault, BOA decided not to pay the guarantee. 
Even more perplexing is the reason that BOA gave for not honoring the guarantee. They determined "" the delay was due to the seller delaying the closing as he/she/they were out of town and required a mail-out ''. But BOA has the events completely backward. The seller was in town on XXXX XXXX ( the original closing date ) and available to meet at the title company to sign the documents. The seller moved from XXXX to XXXX the day after the scheduled closing date ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) and only required a mail out of the documents because BOA pushed the closing date back a week ( to XXXX/XXXX/16 ). Had BOA met the guaranteed closing date, the seller would not have required a mail out. 
I explained this to the Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX, and he appealed the decision, but the appeal was denied. I then contacted his Supervisor, XXXX XXXX, who examined my file and indicated that he had identified the source of the misunderstanding. He assured me that he would resubmitted my claim and was confident that I would receive a satisfactory result. That was in XX/XX/XXXX and I never heard back from him. I have since attempted to contact him via email and left voice mails but have received no response. 
Both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX declined to provide me with the name of the department that handles these decisions. So, with no other means of recourse, I am hoping that filing a complaint will result in BOA honoring their guarantee by paying me the {$500.00} I am due."

Mortgage,"I am writing this letter to inform you of my family 's treatment by Bank of America during our recent mortgage process. This was our first experience as a potentially new customer with BOA and the result was an humiliating experience. It illustrated a lack of sensitivity and understanding by BOA of HIPPA laws, the XXXX Act, Social Security regulations, ECOA, Fair Housing Act and CFPB banking Standards. We feel that we were treated differently than XXXX mortgage applicants. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2014, we applied for a VA Loan through a wonderful and professional local BOA Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX. She guided us smoothly through the application and loan process. We provided everything that BOA required in a prompt manner. Less than 4 days to our closing date, BOA 's mortgage department notified us via email that our loan approval could be jeopardized by a Social Security income verification requirement. BOA required us to provide medical proof of the permanency of the XXXX of my daughter from the Social Security Administration. We had previously provided BOA with the SS Award Letter. In addition, my wife and I had also provided a detailed personal letter, dated XXXX XXXX 2014, regarding the medical aspect of our purchase of this home. We relayed this requested information to the local SS office, which stated that they did not provide such a letter. In an attempt to find another way to provide this information, we researched the matter and came across information published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that greatly concerned us. We uploaded and emailed BOA 's Mortgage, the CFPB Bulletin XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2014 that clearly prohibit this type of disparate and burdensome verification. You would think that the matter would be resolved. No!! The following day, sitting with our local Mortgage Officer, XXXX XXXX with the BOA underwriter on the phone, XXXX XXXX relayed verbatim from the underwriter that our loan approval required that we provide medical proof of the permanency of XXXX and continuation of SS benefits for 3 years. We explained the SS response and asked XXXX XXXX to put the BOA underwriter on speakerphone. The underwriter refused to speak with us. The conversation ended with XXXX XXXX clearly restating the underwriters requirement of medical proof of the permanency of the XXXX before the loan would be approved. There was no misinterpreting the conversation. 

We left the office visibly upset and alarmed by the uncompromising position of BOA in the face of clear regulatory guidance. This was only 3 days until our scheduled closing, with our house packed, significant financial outlays, moving expenses, insurance and utilities in place and the seller stuck in limbo. Most egregious was how BOA purposely disregarded the CFPB Bulletin with no way to provide proof from SS besides the Award Letter. We were stressed, disappointed and angry!! At this point we realized that we were facing discrimination based on XXXX. BOA underwriting compromised my daughter 's personal and medical privacy by demanding we send sensitive health records in order to approve the loan. It was only after we uploaded these records to BOA and emailed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX that our loan was approved. We have clear documentation and emails that proves and support our allegations. 

As a XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran and father of a daughter with permanent XXXX, we were subjected to a loan process that clearly undermined our medical privacy and rights to buy a house without undue burden. The issue that continues to hurt us greatly, is that our request for medical privacy regarding our daughter 's XXXX was ignored by BOA. Her medical records now reside in your database and the email accounts of several BOA employees. Why were we subjected to this?"

Mortgage,"We received a modification offer but sent appeal of the payments to BoA they never responded to our request to lower the payment they Offered FHA loan counseling said the rescue act could do a second put at end of loan. BoA never responded their lawyer said we needed full amount to reinstate. FHA said no. 
I also asked for amount BoA would accept to payoff the loan the lawyer said he would get back then he quit. 
Attaching what we received had no clue to interest charged or how BoA arrived at the payment."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) assumed my home equity loan from Bank of America in XX/XX/XXXX. I received no written notification that this had occurred, which from what I have read is required by law at least 15 days prior to my loan being sold. I applied for a new loan with XXXX XXXX  in XXXX to pay off this loan after reading the reviews of XXXX. I was to sign the papers for this loan today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). However, I received a phone call from an officer at XXXX XXXX  facilitating my loan today in which he stated XXXX had filed an additional complaint to the credit reporting agencies, today, saying I was 120 days delinquent. I didn't find out until XXXX Bank of America had sold my loan when I went in and spoke to an officer and was informed by him that that was what happened. I was told by him they had mailed a notification of this to the address I lived at when I took out the loan. I haven't lived there for 12 years and they have all my current address and telephone information because I still bank with them. So is Bank of America 's incompetence my fault? 

I didn't make payments from XXXX to XXXX because I had no idea where to make a payment. Yes, I should have gone to Bank of America when that loan disappeared from my accounts. My bad. However, XXXX during that time period made no attempt to contact me and they can't say they couldn't get my current address and phone number from Bank of America. There are no other companies - mobile phone, power, water, etc ... that wouldn't notify you if you were past due on a bill after a month. This was done deliberately by them, of this I have no doubt, in the hopes they would be able to foreclose on my house. 

As soon as I did contact XXXX I brought my account up to date. They then told me my XXXX payment was for the amount of {$740.00}. My loan was converted to a fixed rate option in XX/XX/XXXX. My payments are {$460.00} per month. By telling me that's what my payment was they committed fraud. A lawyer told me they can't increase my payments and I pay my taxes and insurance myself. As I far as I'm concerned they owe me {$280.00}. And I was told by representative of XXXX that my XXXX payment and all after were going to increase to approximately {$810.00} no explanation as to why. 

I want the 120 day delinquency removed from my credit report because they broke the law by not sending me written notification, to my current address, that they had assumed my loan in XX/XX/XXXX. I want this done so I can secure a new loan with an honest bank in order to pay them off and get out from being under them. I had never missed a payment until they took this over and I wouldn't have if I had known who to whom to make a payment. XXXX is company run by low lifes who profit off other peoples misery ( please read the reviews online, that is if you have a strong stomach ). Hence, the over 600 complaints to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  in one year and over 2,000 to the CFPB. XXXX XXXX XXXX should be the poster child for corporate greed in America."
Mortgage,"In the spring of XXXX, we opted to have our mortgage put in forbearance due to job loss by my husband. Bank of America called weekly and daily asking when we planned to pay ... everytime we told them we planned to resume mortgage payments in XXXX once my husband was back working, which we did. The bank sent a letter giving us an option enter a deferral and said to submit payment by XXXX XXXX to accept the terms, which we did. We paid online as usual and paid our mortgage HOWEVER the amount that Bank of America had posted online was different from what our letter indicated was the amount due which we did not realize. Bank of America did not update the amount on their website and we paid what was noted as the amount we owed for that date. We continued to receive calls from Bank of America indicating our mortgage was still in forbearance at which time we realized the discrepancy. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my husband ( XXXX XXXX ) spoke wo XXXX XXXX and said if we paid the {$15.00} then we would be all set and the mortgage would automatically come out of forebearance, which we did do. However calls continued indicating our mortgage was still in forebearance. We were told that today we would have this matter resolved yet today we called and the issue is still not resolved. We want to be able to refinance our home mortgage and take advantage of the low rates, however we can not since our home is still noted as in forebearance. WE NEED THIS RESOLVED. I do not want to keep going in circles with Bank of America. We have a made a total of 15 calls to their call center all of which were recorded and we expect this matter resolved otherwise we will take legal action. We have been paying our mortgage however this month decided not to until this matter is resolved since our account is still marked in forebearance. This experience has caused us substantial mental stress."
Mortgage,"Almost 4 years ago, Bank of America started foreclosure actions against my family after we fell behind on our mortgage. They demanded a reinstatement amount that was more than three times the actual past due payments. When we questioned them on this, they simply insisted on receiving the amount they demanded and initiated foreclosure. 

We applied three times for loan modification with BOA before we got a trial modification. Each time they denied receiving the application. We successfully completed the trial period but BOA never stopped the foreclosure process in court. 

Three months after we completed the trial modification process, we got a permanent modification package. When we scrutinized the small print in the new loan documents, we discovered that Bank of America had actually increased our monthly payment by over {$60.00} even though their trial modification documents had clearly and specifically stated that our payment would not exceed a certain amount if we successfully completed the trial modification process. 

In fact, the amount by which our monthly mortgage statement could go up was specifically stated in the trial modification documents! All through this period, we were making our monthly payments. However, when we questioned the discrepancy between the trial and permanent loan modification documents, Bank of America stopped accepting our mortgage payments and foreclosed on our home. 

Then, without informing us, they transferred our file to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, sold our home at auction and submitted false $ numbers to the court as the amount they spent in selling our home! Never mind the fact they were the only bidder, or that they bid an amount higher than the actual balance due. Today, we are told that XXXX XXXX, is actually working for XXXX. 

Recently, we found out that the mortgage modification Bank of America gave us was actually not XXXX under the XXXX XXXX federal government mandated program under which we had actually applied. With the "" generic '' modification Bank of America gave us, we lost some rights and protection to which we would have been entitled under XXXX. 

Our mortgage account # is : XXXX and our case file # is : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, Illinois ). We are legally fighting XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Bank of America. We have limited financial resources to continue fighting these big companies for our home. We should not be made homeless because Bank of America is deceitful and corrupt. 

This is part of the reason why there is so much public discontent and lack of trust for these big fraudulent banks and our elected officials."
Mortgage,"Bank of America seems intent on charging us for additional flood insurance coverage on our property that they hold the mortgage on. This is a yearly struggle in which they send us numerous letters stating that the coverage is insufficient and stating that they will charge us roughly {$2000.00} for additional coverage. In the most current year we have been working with the property 's insurance company, XXXX, to supply them with the information since XX/XX/XXXX. While the property ( which is a multi unit resort ) coverage has not changed substantially in the ten years we have owned our condo unit, BofA annually sends us these letters threatening to charge us for unneeded coverage. This past year they have made the process even more difficult. Below is a copy of  the letter I sent them today. 

We have just received the sixth request, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from you for flood insurance coverage on our condo located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, HI XXXX. We and our insurance company, XXXX, have supplied you with this information multiple times so far, yet cant seem to satisfy your need to attempt to charge us for additional coverage, which appears to be your goal. These notices date as far back as XX/XX/XXXX, and we have responded to each and every one with the information requested. 

As recently as XX/XX/XXXX both I and our XXXX representative spoke with your department in an attempt to determine what was still needed, and to supply that information. On that date, XXXX faxed you the entire flood policy for the building that our unit is located ( there are three policies in total that cover the entire resort ). I was told by one of your representatives that this was all that was needed, just the policy for the building that our unit was located in. He could not explain why we seem to have had more scrutiny regarding these policies than in years past, when a policy declaration sheet was sufficient to satisfy your department. Not that it hasnt taken months in past years to satisfy these requests, but this year has taken six months to get to this point, and you still arent satisfied. It certainly appears that upselling additional insurance is the goal here. The basis coverages provided by the resorts insurance company have not significantly changed in the ten years that we have been dealing with these annual requests. 

The latest request indicates that the flood insurance coverage is insufficient, and calls for additional coverage at a cost of us of {$380.00}. This is exactly the same request that we received in a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX, and was responded to by XXXX with declarations in early XX/XX/XXXX. How is it that now we are receiving yet another request? 

This latest request follows another one just received, dated XX/XX/XXXX. In that one your department threatens to charge us {$1900.00} for additional flood insurance coverage. We responded to that exact notice dated XX/XX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX as well, and again on XX/XX/XXXX as outlined above."

Mortgage,"A couple of months ago, while trying to get in touch with customer service at Bank of America, I was transferred to another department who told me out of the blue that I owe a {$290.00} appraisal fee from 2009. As a result of XXXX due to XXXX in the military, my income decreased substantially and foreclosure proceedings were started on my property. When I received back-pay from the XXXX XXXX that was owed to me, I pulled the house out of foreclosure and I 've never had a late payment since then. I did n't know an appraisal was done in 2009 or that I 've owed Bank of America {$290.00} since 2009. XXXX XXXX refused to waive the fee and after I asked to speak to a supervisor she put me thru to XXXX XXXX ( or XXXX ) voicemail. I left multiple messages and he never returned my calls. I called Bank of America 's customer service number multiple times, and sent multiple messages to them via their website, and they continue to refuse to waive the fee. One phone representative said, "" Why should we waive the fee when you 're the one who did n't pay your mortgage? '' I asked them how they could 've done an appraisal back in 2009 without access to the interior of my property, and they said the appraiser walked around the outside of the house. So, I was charged {$290.00} for an appraiser to walk around the outside of my house? I never gave permission for an appraiser to be on my property, I do n't think a 2 minute walk around my house meets the definition of an "" appraisal, '' and it definitely is n't worth {$290.00}. This fee is also attached to the HELOC for some unknown reason instead of the XXXX mortgage. I 'd like Bank of America to waive this fee."
Mortgage,"I have contacted politicians about this issue. No one wants to touch it because the national association XXXX XXXX is a big pac. 
I would like appraisers not to include real estate commissions and bank fees when they use sales comparables for determining the value of a house for sale that is then used for underwriting. Sales commissions and loan fees add XXXX value to a home. They are not a new roof for new sewer line, yet routinely 6 % of the amount shown as what a property sold for recently is included in the "" value '' of a house. The appraisers are supposed to be independent of agents and mortgage brokers, but they often are members of XXXX. XXXX has a conflicting interest to keep their commissions included in the value of homes sold because it means real estate prices are driven up in those locales by six percent, more money for them. Since people buy and sell houses after only a few years, the appraised values of homes are being inflated by 12+ percent above market forces. I personally consider this price fixing. The Real estate roundtable lobbies for this issue to the extreme detriment of consumers. This issue is making the housing crisis worse. It may not seem like a lot but a house overvalued by 6 percent is {$30000.00} on a typical {$500000.00} home. That money should not be part of the appraised value. I'm home shopping and disgusted by this practice. It's industry standard so my complaint is against all appraisers, all mortgage lenders, and all real estate agents."
Mortgage,"After going past my original closing date, the seller was nice enough to sign contract extension paperwork to give me more time to get the appraisal on the house done and underwriting done. But after another two weeks had passed, the appraisal was completed, but I will still not out of underwriting. So when it came time to sign a new contract extension, the seller didn't want to wait on Bank of America because they took too long to get me out of underwriting. So when it came time for Bank of America to give me my denial letter to get my earnest money back, I never received the denial letter. Because of that, I would have been out of {$5000.00} if the seller wasn't nice enough to understand what I was going through and give my money back. Because under normal conditions, a seller doesn't have to give it back without a denial letter."
Mortgage,"For four years, from XXXX XXXX, XXXX though XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Bank of America has never provided written notice on appeal, or any notice detailing the exact reason ( s ) for denial on appeal, or aprovided any statement indicating one can obtain the documentation in which a denial is based upon. 
Upon receipt of my complete RMA application for a foreclosure prevention alternative offered by, or through, the Bank of America mortgage servicer, a mortgage servicer, trustee, mortgagee, beneficiary, or authorized agent, Bank of America shall not cause he recording of a notice of sale or conduct a trustee 's sale while the complete foreclosure prevention alternative application is pending, and until the borrower has been provided with a written determination by the mortgage servicer on appeal regarding that borrower 's eligibility for the requested foreclosure prevention alternative. Following the denial on appeal of a first lien loan modification application, the mortgage servicer shall send a written notice to the borrower identifying with specificity the reasons for the denial and shall include a statement that the borrower may obtain additional documentation supporting the denial decision upon written request to the mortgage servicer. If foreclosure alternative is approved of in writing, servicer can not record an NOD, NTS, or conduct a sale while borrower is compliant with agreement, or has provided servicer proof of funds/financing, or is awaiting the written notice in accordance with California Civil Code XXXX )."
Mortgage,"The company keeps raising the mortgage payment not in accordance with the agreement schedule given to us. It started out 2 years ago with a payment of {$1100.00} and now its over {$1400.00}. This is a loan modification which was a HELOC loan number XXXX where the payment became {$3200.00} at the 2nd phase of the loan.It was impossible for us to pay the XXXXThe load mod was supposed to give us relief. Moreover over payments were put into principal pay downs which were not authorized by us.Further they harassed us with the house insurance ( they said we had none... we sent the declaration page to them ) which we have had since 2004 threatening us to charge us for the insurance we already had.We have all the phone calls and statements and agreements documented but since we have had a death in the family have not had an opportunity to send it all to you.We have been on the phone with BOA for hours and still nothing has been done, Just fake promises."
Mortgage,"XXXX, I have reached out to Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX asked about the refinancing mortgage. I was looking to change my job from XXXX to XXXX. I told Mr.XXXX  that I am looking to change my job and the new job may need me to move to XXXX next year. He said it is not an issue if I do not move before the application is done.

So, I proceed with the application and paid for appraisal and XXXX lawyer fees and application fees that Mr. XXXX introduced me. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( NMLS : XXXX ) called me stating that he needs an email stating that I am currently working from home. So, I provided the email from HR confirming that I am currently working from home. 

I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but did not get any response. So, I reached out to Mr. XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Mr. XXXX called me on XX/XX/XXXX that my application is rejected because they think I will move to XXXX. 
I told Mr. XXXX that all my documents I shows that I am currently working from home and all my documents shows that I work and live in NY. I told Mr. XXXX in a good faith that I may need to move next year which he said fine which should be recorded on the line. 

Mr. XXXX said all calls are not recorded due to COVID and can only refund appraisal but can not pay any XXXX related fees. 

Bank of America agent Mr.XXXX  lied to me that it would be okay. I provided all the documents that they asked, but they still rejected my application."
Mortgage,"I submitted a payment for my interest only mortgage for XX/XX/2020. Instead of my regular payment amount of {$1300.00} being debited, Bank of America debited {$2600.00} and applied half to principal. I dont understand why they did this. 

They have no responded to my secure messages and I can't get anyone on the phone because wait times are over 90 minutes long. I have also asked to be removed from my deferral payment plan and put back on my regular monthly payment plan as it is very confusing on how to pay my regular bill at this point and have received no response."
Mortgage,Notice of representation was sent to Bank of America on XXXX. A letter confirming receipt of authorization along with our request of a verification of mortgage and transaction history were received as requested along with the Notice of representation. After speaking to several representatives in regards to the loan modification our office is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the borrower. This is a stall tactic practice by Bank of America and it 's representatives. On XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Customer Relationship Manager 's state our office is not authorized. This is a violation of the borrower 's rights to legal representation.
Mortgage,"No Single Point of Contact It has been almost two weeks since I found out that Bank of America had set a foreclosure date on my home. 
In XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed complaints on my behalf with the CFPB. 
- During the complaint process Bank of America 's attorney XXXX XXXX, began negotiating a settlement with me. Please see attachments. 
- The CFPB complaints concluded and BOA pulled XXXX XXXX off of my case right in the middle of our settlement negotiations. 
- Very shortly thereafter I found out BOA had put a foreclosure sale date on my home. 
- Since finding out about the sale date my attorney and I have been trying to reach a Single Point of Contact at Bank of America as required by the New Federal Mortgage Servicing Rules. Bank of America has only provided misleading promises of fixing the situation. None of which have been followed thru on. 
- My attorney has been trying to reach Bank of America since XXXX XXXX, XXXX only to be directed to a XXXX XXXX XXXX 's voice mail which does not have call forwarding features. It also does not contain any other contact information. IT IS A DEAD END. 
- I took over calling this week and have experienced the exact same results. 
- Eventually a couple of days ago I found an old phone number that takes me to another department that claims to have no information about my current situation. 
o Some of the representatives at this other number have been able to transfer me to the Case Management Department to speak to another representative. 
o In the conversations with the Case Management Department representatives I have been promised by a supervisor on XXXX occasion and BOA representatives on other occasions, that the phone issue would be resolve immediately. These promises started Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX and my calls still go to XXXX XXXX answering service today Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
- This is now into the second week that I have been unable to reach a Single Point of Contact at Bank of America or any other representative for more than a onetime call. 
o I was told again this morning by a Bank of America representative that XXXX XXXX was my CRM and would be getting in touch with me, then I was transferred to his answering machine "" again '' after I explained to her that he has been left messages daily. 
o I have now lost extremely valuable time to defend my home against their Foreclosure date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX and my attorney has been unable to speak to any representative at BOA who can act as a single point of contact or provide any "" real time '' information concerning my home. THIS IS AN ILLIGAL FORECLOSURE FROM COUNTRYWIDE MISDEEDS. Bank of America 's failure to provide me with a single point of contact is just another way for them keep me from defending my home. 
My desired resolution would be : XXXX Bank of America has failed to provide a Single Point of Contact, to have the foreclosure date stopped immediately and to have XXXX XXXX, Bank of America 's attorney assigned back to my case to continue the settlement negotiation talks/process with my attorney XXXX XXXX who already has approval to speak on my behalf by myself and BOA."
Mortgage,"My loan has been transferred now, but for two years Bank of America tossed me around with making home affordable pulling me in and out of trial plans adding all sorts of foreclosure fees. It wasnt until I began filing complaints and a HUD rep got involved and found many misconducts that it was fixed. Unknowingly I paid my mortgage every month, only they were n't applying it to my loan putting it in a separate account. After all was said and done they were supposed to correct the 20 month negative crediting reporting, that was in XXXX last year still has n't been fixed"
Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX, I submitted via fax my application ( XXXX sheets ) to Bank of America for the Making Home Affordable program. Several days later when I called to speak with XXXX XXXX, my customer relationship manager, he was unavailable and so i spoke with another lady. She informed that BofA wanted me to resubmit a form due to it not being signed. When I did speak with XXXX XXXX 30 minutes later, I asked him if BofA needed any further docs from me, He responded "" No. '' I asked him why, then, had the lady just 30 minutes earlier told me the system showed I did. He responded, "" Oh, do you want me to go over that again with you? '' I told him it was curious to me for him to say I did n't need anything furher when the system clearly showed I did. On XXXX XXXX, I had refaxed several things. I asked XXXX XXXX on XXXX, XXXX XXXX if for sure now I did not need to submit anything further. he stated my fax had been received, and that I did not. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On each of those days I CLEARLY asked him if anything was showing up that still needed to be submitted by me. Time is very much of the essence due to my large XXXX mortgage ( both my XXXX and XXXX mortgages are with BofA ) going to quadruple in its monthly payment in XXXX, of XXXX - with the result bieng I IMMEDIATELY wo n't able to pay it. He 's fully aware of this. I was very disappointed and angered yesterday ( Thurs. XXXX XXXX ). XXXX XXXX had a scheduled appt. to call me. Since he did not go to work, however, another lady called me. I could not BELIEVE what I was hearing when she told me that the system showed that I still needed to resumbit XXXX XXXX of my basis application form - due to nothing having been placed on it regarding credit counseling. I told her I think she is making a mistake scine XXXX XXXX had told me last Fri as well as on Mon, Tues, and Wed. that I did not still need to submit anything. She told me the system CLEARLY stated I needed to submit this before BofA could move to the review phase in the modification process. I asked her if she could see when this request was given to him for underwriting dept. She told me - Friday, XXXX XXXX! I was aghast! His poor performance had cost me a WEEK in terms of moving forward in the process. How much longer would he have told me I did n't need to submit anything, had she not informed me yesterday? -- - I had complained to his supervisor, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) about how he had been rude and impatient and seemed totally uncaring during my talks with him prior to submitting my paperwork. After I left her a message on a Friday, the next Monday, although I thought my appt. with XXXX XXXX was at XXXX PST ( as it had been a number of times ), he called me at XXXX XXXX. When I answered there was no response. Later, a person said the records show he was the XXXX who placed the call. My thoughts were that he was being vindictive due to my having left the complaint about him to his supervisor the previous Friday. When XXXX XXXX did get back with me ( XXXX or 5 days later as opposed to the 24 hours she says she wil lon her voice mail ) she told me that I could change case relationship managers, but that it can take XXXX to 7 days to do it. With my time being so short before I am unable to pay the mortgage - and needing to get it done - I told her I would stay with having XXXX XXXX do it. I thought he would be responsible and not be vincdictive. When I discovered what I did yesterday I believe very much that he was indeed being vindictive - and was actually intentionally delaying the process so that I would not benefit as much as I could. I did formally request a change in case XXXX manager today. But am so disapponted over this man 's poor and perhaps contrived and deliberate attempts to cause me harm. I hope you will investige so he ca n't harm others."
Mortgage,"This this is not a duplicate of CFPB Case number : XXXX as it is a new and separate incident. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after the issuance of the XX/XX/XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX installment statement and immediately prior to the Trustee Sale of XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America bought down the principal balance associated with this account twice, meaning it was bought down XX/XX/XXXX and put back after I called Bank of America on this illegal activity related to a mortgage or Deed of Trust and then bought down again XX/XX/XXXX. 

According to the information and representations provided to me on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX ( Customer Service Department ) and XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX ( Home Retention Department ) Bank of America employees, the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX installment payment amount is {$1100.00}, reduced from {$1500.00}. I was also informed the adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) will adjust between {$1100.00} and {$1200.00} effective XX/XX/XXXX which is supported by information received from the Trustee, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), that the MAXIMUM bid at Trustee 's Sale and public auction has been reduced to {$300000.00}. Obviously, this amount excludes the MHA and CalHFA monies due at time of sale. To date, neither the MHA and CalHFA debts have been satisfied and are currently attached to the account. 

This account is a signature loan as established XX/XX/XXXX and the associated real proprty had not been used as collateral to secure the XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust that Bank of America has foreclosed upon after a seven ( 7 ) year delinquency and after a rejected settlement offer made a year before recording a Notice of Default ( NOD ). Clearly, the Notice of Trustee Sale ( NTS ) ( which I have yet to receive a recorded copy of ) is a retaliatory action related to a mortgage or Deed of Trust. 

All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and mandatory."
Mortgage,"Pulled boa response when they filed into the BK case a XXXX XXXXXXXX forged redacted FHA mortgage. 
The documents are from my case the letter they filed we never received anything from BoA or their lawyers. They claim we closed the loan won't tell us where we closed it. 
We never signed an FHA mortgage with BoA i know they forge mortgages XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"Little over 2 years ago I applied and received a loan mod for my FHA loan. I completed the trial period and was able to pay the loan on time. In the meantime I was no longer able to work due to a XXXX. I applied for XXXX, the waiting period for a court date was 2 years in itself. In the meantime my house hold income was also reduced because of a separation with my wife ( which is still the case ) reduced my monthly income, disallowing me to make partial payments to catch up my arrears. While I was waiting for this I was borrowing money from my parents to pay the mortgage in the interim. I did finally receive my XXXX last XXXX, 2015. I had to use my back pay to pay back my parents the money I owed them and still needed to pay more back to them. I ended up getting behind once again after 5 months or so as I was still paying everyone back. Once I started to get behind ( XXXX payments ) I immediately applied for a loan mod from BOA. During the pre-screening of qualifications they asked a series of questions. I also made clear to them that I did not know if because I had a mod. less than 2 years prior would I still qualify, based on that soley they said yes I would. 
A year went by they continually added hoops to jump through and in fact put hoops I had already jumped through in front of me again. At the end they said I did not qualify for a mod because it had been less than 2 years! Now I am at a point which I have to file for Chapter XXXX to catch the arrears up on my house. If they had told me from the beginning I did not qualify based on the initial information I could have went forward with the chapter XXXX and made it much more affordable to pay this back."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has had ample time to consider my complete as received Request for Mortgage Assistance ( RMA ) application package of XXXX XXXX. 
Bank of America, their representatives, and servicer can not record an NOD, an NTS, or conduct a sale while the application is pending per California Civil Code ( XXXX ( c ) ) and, if application is denied, until 31 days after providing borrower with a written denial per California Civil Code XXXX ( XXXX ) ( XXXX ). 
While there is no consistent or well established Bank of America deadline for borrower 's to submit an RMA application, I submitted a complete RMA application package and all other Bank of America requested documents on and before XXXX XXXX, XXXX without delay. 
Bank of America has decided not to provide a written determination to the XXXX XXXX RMA from the Bank of America Appeals Department to date. While there seems not to be any Bank of America deadline for servicer 's application evaluation and no established deadline to process an appeal, it does n't take over four years to come to a decision and issue a written determination and direction unless the bank has decided to park and stall the modification process indefinitely. However, this park and stall tactic is at odds and inconsistent with the recent efforts to collect on this home loan mortgage account. 
Bank of America, their representatives, and the servicer may not record an NOD, NTS, or conduct a sale until the later of : 1 ) 15 days after the appeal is denied ; or 2 ) 14 days after modification is offered. 
As a borrower must accept an offered modification within 14 days or offer is considered rejected per California Civil Code XXXX ( XXXX ) ( XXXX ), the same standard is to be placed upon the bank and servicer. Since Bank of America has declined to timely process a complete RMA so as to complete the modification process, Bank of America and their representatives and servicer forfeit rights to decline an evaluation, issue a written denial, and foreclose. 
Bank of America has not offered a MHA HAMP TPP based on the XXXX XXXX RMA before or after XXXX XXXX. Thus, I have never rejected a modification in accordance with California Civil Code XXXX ( XXXX ) ( XXXX ) because I have had no option and opportunity to accept or reject a modification timely presented to me by Bank of Americ based on my XXXX XXXX RMA."
Mortgage,We pay tax directly to our town. My wife forgot to pay tax man in late XXXX and early XXXX. When I was notified I sent BOA a payment for XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to get us back on schedule. BOA has been screwed up ever since. After I finally got a person to return our call she ended up asking for us to send her XXXX and they would refund it. We said OK but need this in writing. She ( XXXX ) said they can not put anything in writing to us. Im concerned that they are going to keep this madness going for another year. We have made all tax payments and mortgage payments and need BOA to release us from XXXX payments. All of there branches are closed in NJ and no one can fix there computer problem. They acknowledged that they can see the tax collector has returned 3 quarterly tax payments. They are threatening to take our house and refuse to stop. Help us help them!!! We have not missed a payment in over a year and it was an error. Have been with BOA since XXXX. Help XXXX XXXX XXXX
Mortgage,"I contacted Bank Of America and asked them if I can split my mortgage payment into 2 payments sent in at different times during the month. They agreed. Earlier this month I sent in half my amount due, with the other half being sent next Friday. Today I got a letter from Bank of America stating that they took the funds I sent and applied it to an applied funds account, which means they do n't show me as having paid anything"
Mortgage,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am a single parent of XXXX boys. I purchased a home from bank of america/countrywide. The Seller ( who was BOA ) failed to disclose issues with the home that included significant construction defects and many misrepresentations. They entered an agreement to fix the home but did not complete everything per that agreement. I later became aware that the employees that sold me the home were committing fraud at the bank. It had been reported to the FBI XXXX  NC office. Apparently what they did on my home mirrored what they had done on other properties that involved a fraud for profit or builder fraud for profit scheme or even a straw buyer.

I first came in contact with the BOA former Countrywide employees XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX   because of the complaint I had against the builder, XXXX XXXX   and the realtor, XXXX XXXX who executed a remodel contract on this home prior to ownership in order to take money from me but not put it into the home. They informed me that I going to get credit on it at closing. My chief complaint against Bank of America is that they provided a faulty home, misrepresented the value, misrepresented their own conflicts of interest since the XXXX   brother was one of the contractors on the home ( XXXX XXXX  ) ; they violated the Deceptive Trade Practices and failed to disclose issues with the home that they would have known since they managed the property in all phases of construction. I also found out that the person who signed these so called agreements to me ( XXXX XXXX ) was not an officer at the bank and they used me to cover up their illegal acts within the bank along side the builder, per the whistleblower. I was also informed that all the monies I had put in the home prior to closing on the home should have been reflected on my HUD settlement statement. I never received any credit for anything. Instead I was sold a home with significant defects, non-disclosure of information and no record of any of the funds paid into the home prior to closing and then I was placed in the position of working with contractors direct that should have never occurred. All monies should have been recorded.

This whole situation regarding bank of america destroyed my business and credit, has placed in risk of foreclosure with XXXX XXXX ( my main mortgage servicer ) ; created a negative home equity loan situation with XXXX XXXX XXXX due to the overinflated appraisals that BOA provided and misrepresented to all parties. My family and I are living in a home that is not refinanceable, re-sellable or even habitable in part of the home due to the significant construction defects that were never disclosed by the employees at BOA because of their own conflicts of interests and involvement with the contractors themselves. The total cost remedy of the defects is over {$250000.00}.

In addition, BOA failed to pay and clear a mechanics lien until I sued the title company then the title company sued BOA to remove the lien. This clouded the title.So I should have never even closed on any loans. It cost me over {$140000.00} in fees with XXXX XXXX, over {$110000.00} in fees with XXXX XXXX  and I still risk losing my home due to the financial impact because of it all. I was forced into filing bankrupcty because of all of this with still no remedy of my home due to lack of funds. I had a lawsuit against BOA but I had to withdrawal it due to legal expense and in order to preserve my claims while in Chapter XXXX  bankruptcy. I am hopeful that by me sharing my story, the CFPB can assist me with this once and for all and bring resolution to this highly stressful situation that has caused me and my family a huge financial hardship and compromised health due to the toxic mold in the home. I am providing documents including the whistleblower testimony and the expert report of this case with hopes that you can assist or provide me some guidance for resolution. Please let me know if you want any other documents. I have several witnesses that has been willing to testify against BOA or assist in any way. All of these issues have negatively impacted the value of the home by almost half."
Mortgage,I having problems with BOA with my mortgage an a loan equity. After they had converted the mortgage with the loan equity loan. They still charging me for the equity loan
Mortgage,"This summer I started the process of refinancing my home with Bank of America to lower the monthly payment. 
When I initially spoke to the loan officer, around XXXX XXXX, 2015 the discussion of the configuration of my home was discussed, that there was a guest suite in the lower level of the home. A friend of mine is staying there at this time. There was no discussion that this would be a problem. 

After I satisfied numerous concerns that were raised as to income, insurance etc. there was a call XXXX asking for a charge card so an appraisal could be done. At this point the only concern The loan officer addressed was that the house would appraise at least {$180000.00}. At this point there was no mention of any problems. The fee charged on XXXX XXXX was {$460.00}. 

After the appraisal was completed, I was asked to provide another letter of explanation for XXXX items. After I provided these I did not hear from the loan officer until I contacted him on XXXX XXXX to ask the status of the loan. When he contacted me he stated he had made multiple attempts on getting an update, there was nothing left remaining on my file. He was to double check. 

On XXXX XXXX late in the afternoon I received a call stating that the underwriter had refused the loan because there was a kitchen on the lower level. This was the first time this issue had been raised. This is a fairly common configuration in houses in this area. 

Needless to say I am concerned about the money I have invested in the appraisal of this property and would like to address my dissatisfaction with the way this matter has been handled. If this loan does not go through I would like to be reimbursed for this expense."
Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX I submitted a complaint concerning a mortgage loan with Bank of America. 
I would like to submit additional information I received after XXXX XXXX, 2016. It involves a letter from BOA concerning collateral and insufficient funds. 
The documents I am providing will show BOA claims to be untrue. The banking statements will show there was adequate funds available."
Mortgage,"In this case discovery was never completed, conditioned presedence was never met, no testimony given, no witnesses to alledge factsgiven under oath, statements presented was based on heresay.However on the forth hearing opposing counsel prensented a note with brite blue signitures and the Judge asked me was that my signiture, as I was replying that it looked like my signature opposing counsel interrupted and said `even he admits it your honor`, my finish statement was your honor they can put your signiture on anything. 
Next the Judge said if either party would like to send me any additional information before I make decision you have eight days to do so. 
Below is the additional information I sent to the Judge however I do not believe he got an opputunity to read it prior rendering a decision. 


IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CONNECTICUTJ.D OF XXXXBANK OF AMERICA. N.A. 
PLAINTIFFv. DOCKET NO : XXXX ANDDEFENDANTSXXXX/XX/XX/XXXXMy name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX After losing my job of 28 years I finally found a lower paying job and tried to get a modification but did not qualify. However, in the process I found many inconsistencies in the information that Bank of America provided. On XXXX I sent a dispute letter asking for validation of the debt. I never received a validation from Bank of America. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, two months later after they received my dispute letter a law suit was initiated, DOC # XXXX. Thereby, not conforming to "" conditions precedence '', I have received separate statements from Bank of America in which they stated that they were the creditor, the debt collector and the servicer. 
I also received printout records that evidenced that the debt was purchased while the account was in default which is a violation of FDCPA XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
According to XXXX I.D Min # XXXX XXXX it states that Bank of America is the servicer and XXXX XXXX is the investor, which shows that Bank of America is in violation of the FDCPA 15 USC 1692 E. 
They have failed to show information proving verification. The assignment given as proof of their ownership is riddle with names which have been shown to be ROB0 signers. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, they have been publicly verified as ROBO signers. As this information has been submitted to the court evidencing XXXX distinctly different signatures for each name. Therefore, this unknown debt collector refuse to make full disclosure of information requested through discovery! 
It is my belief that all such information was fraudulently produced. Such fraudulent behavior has already been ruled Res judacata by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ( CFPB ) I am exercising my private right of action in accord with the Supreme Court ruling of XXXX vs Countrywide, and thus rescinding with damages because of such attempts to defraud!

Mortgage,"I have already complained about Bank of America, in tracking number XXXX at this cfpb website. What I complained about were ( from memory now ) 2 things ; 1 was they accepted us into a program to modify our home loan, but dragged it out, while deceiving us, in my opinion, and at the same time confused the heck out of the issue by approaching us thru both avenues from their Legal Dept and Mortgage Dept. They played us and deceived us. - Then, "" BANA '' sold our file to XXXX Bank. 

It is perfectly legal, i 'm sure, for them to sell our file, but, a new problem came up when BANA 's contract legal entity responded to my complaint by saying first that, as if, for a fact that I "" acknowledge they were no longer had custody of ; or in ownership, or control of that file - and I objected - yeah i was angry and it showed, and i 'm sorry to snap back but, there is no way I could have acknowledged that the file was indeed out of their hands and transferred to XXXX Mortgage services, without having seen the legal proof of that. I called them and their work and claims "" sloppy '' for claiming i acknowledged a "" fact '', when, all I could acknowledge was that BANA actually only TOLD me the file would be transferred on XX/XX/XXXX. My original complaint with them was on XX/XX/XXXX. - I was so angry, because it seems everything that used to be good about the USA has been reduced to relying on ignorance and stupidity.. eg : Our 4th Estate ( Journalism & News ) : When they can not get details correct and get sloppy, as in : "" The White House knows exactly where the WMD in XXXX are '', vs the FACT of the matter : "" The White House SAYS they know exactly where ... '' Am I losing my mind? -- That contract law firm should have responded to my anger by THINKING about it, and deciding to be sure that all the i 's were dotted and t 's were crossed, and that the "" Bill of Sale '' or whatever it is called was fully complete, error-free, and legal .... And then respond, and even send me a copy showing the account number, the street address, city, state, - their name, my name, the receiving bank 's name, all spelled correctly so that I can see the proof required for me to "" acknowledge '' a transfer went thru and was fully legal. 

My middle initial is "" XXXX '', and what XXXX used for my middle initial was "" XXXX ''. 
I have a red flag there, and i want to be sure the note is complete and legal, or I will have nightmares forever that "" BANA '' will come after me in 10 years, saying they made a mistake, and the file was never actually sold afterall, because of a typo that showed my name incorrectly, thus null & void and whatever money i paid to XXXX in the meantime was my responsibility to go after, but that "" BANA '' wants payment in full. 

I am not an attorney, but if names and details on any bill of sale are not correct, then in my limited awareness of these things, it was a bogus transfer. 

Therefor, note to "" BANA '' - Show me the legal note of sale for that file. Make sure all T 's are crossed, I 's dotted, and redact the sale price, or terms if you must, but show me the proof the file was legally transferred, and never be sloppy with facts ever again. 

IF i have to come after BANA with some legal force to do this, it eats into my funds I have been saving to prove all these years that we can qualify for a loan modification with XXXX, if that note was legal. 

Seriously, I am not a lawyer, but i expect nothing less than professionalism when it comes to professional people, especially legal people. 

Show me the proof the file was legally transferred, and do n't expect that BANA word is an acceptable substitute for the factual truth - Why is BANA contract legal this sloppy? Is it an industry-wide problem?? 
Too Big To Function is hand-in-hand with Too Big to Fail. 
I think we 're all screwed. 
I want my USA back, and as an XXXX Veteran, I expect no less. 

Thnx"

Mortgage,"I applied for a home equity line of credit from my bank. During the review process there were some missed mortgage payments. I explained to the loan processor that my wife had passed away and automatic payments drawn from our accounts were stopped upon her death. I told them that I was unaware of this due to circumstances related to bereavement. 
The amount of money that I make annually is adequate and is going to be enough not to exceed service to income debt, but what is most is most important is that I do n't owe money except vacation property that is over XXXX more in equity value than when I purchased it."
Mortgage,"As a preferred customer with Bank of America, my husband and I receive a lot of offers to do more business with Bank of America. One day when I was in the bank, one of the staff informed me of a special they were having on HELOC loans, so I sat down to discuss. Prior to applying, I told the bank rep that we had filed for bankruptcy 5 years ago, and asked if this was disqualifying. I was told it was not. I was asked what was the value of our home and how much we still owe. I said we owe {$860000.00} and the value was probably about $ XXXX. I was told that looks fine, so I went ahead and applied. I told the rep we were looking to get a HELOC for $ XXXX XXXX The initial application was a simply two page document. Afterwards, I was contacted by BOA and asked to supply every single piece of financial data on myself, my husband and his business - tax returns, W2s, pay stubs, acct statements, profit/loss statement, etc. Once they had all of my financial information, and had pulled and dinged my credit, I was told BOA only gives HELOCs up to 75 % of value for jumbo loans, meaning we would only be eligible for a loan of less than {$100000.00}, which didn't serve my needs. Next we were told that the loan was denied. When we spoke to a rep on the phone, he specifically requested to speak with my husband and said the loan was denied because of my lower credit score, but that BOA would be willing to approve a HELOC application only in my husband 's name. The formal denial letters sent separately to me and my husband also stated difference reasons for the denial. My letter stated the reason as "" Bankruptcy on file ''. This is problematic because if bankruptcy were grounds for denying the loan, it should have applied to my husband as well. In addition, the BOA rep knew we had filed for bankruptcy before I applied for the loan and before BOA collected all of our financial data. 
In addition, on what grounds can BOA offer my husband a HELOC based on a secured property that we jointly own? He gets all the benefit of the HELOC and yet I share half the risk. Surely, this is against regulation, and it is discriminatory again women in a marital relationship. 
We filed for bankruptcy because of a failed investment debt of my husband 's. It was his debt that was XXXX, not our home nor our vehicles. I am required to share in his debt, however, financial institutions can consider us differently after the bankruptcy given his very high income and my average income. This is discriminatory and gender biased."

Mortgage,"I have a mortgage with Bank of America that was started XXXX of 2012. Please keep in mind this was the end of the real estate bubble bursting. 

My mortgage amount was for {$76000.00}. 

The type of loan is CONVENTIONAL RES WITHOUT PMI / 30yrs / FIXED. 

I want to close my escrow account. The bank is telling I can not do this until my princepal amount is 80 % of the appraised amount at the time of the mortgage. They have stated to me on the phone that this is due to state regulations. I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX and they told me there is no such regulation. 

Here comes the next very confusing detail. The appraisal on the house is for {$33000.00}. What bank does a mortgage at over 200 % LTV and without PMI. The current value of the house is Approximately {$130000.00} to {$140000.00} and I owe {$58000.00}. 

All I want is to do is close the escrow account and I feel like I am being giving bad info so I have to keep the escrow account."
Mortgage,"In XXXX I applied for a HELOC in the amount of {$80000.00} and was approved. In XXXX I requested an increase to {$180000.00} and was again approved based upon an appraised value of {$500000.00} on my home. Instead of increasing the LOC, they created a new LOC as requested, they created a separate LOC in a XXXX subordinate position, so I now had XXXX HELOCs. There was already a 1st mortgage in place of {$300000.00} with another bank. When the recession hit in XXXX, my home dropped in value to {$320000.00} and has not fully recovered. In the past 4 years I have tried to get a modification on XXXX Lines, went through intensive documentation requirements and was turned down without recourse each time, most recently this summer.

Two months ago, the 2nd LOC went to term and the payments increase from $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month. The bank has not worked in good faith to try and remedy this situation which has developed on a loan that should not have been granted in the first place. I can not refinance due to the lack of equity. I owe slightly more than the value of the house. Selling presents a similar problem.

Mortgage,Merrill Lynch sold my loan to Bank of America. Bank of America calculates the interest on the loan differently than Merrill Lynch did. The Bank of America calculation is always either the same or higher. I contacted Bank of America and was told that they are aware of the difference but will not be calculating the interest the way Merrill Lynch did. Bank of America told me that I am not the only XXXX with this issue.
Mortgage,"We are reaching out to you for your help in protecting us ( consumers ) against wrongful accusations from bank ( mortgage loan ) establishments. Attached are documents and letters that will help support our case of wrongful and fraudulent activity committed against us. We originally obtained a mortgage loan from Countrywide Home Loans with a 1st and 2nd loan in 2006. Later on we found out this mortgage was a fraudulent loan to begin with. They used inaccurate income, asset and liability. They also incorrectly reported our principal balance over $ 40XXXXXXXX than the original loan."
Mortgage,"I refinanced my home to get away from Bank of America due to their poor customer service ( previous complaint filed by me through this service ). Due to the processing time with closing, I went ahead & made a payment to avoid any 30 day late reporting to the credit bureaus. Payment would have been received by BofA on or about XXXX XXXX. I called on XXXX XXXX to make sure they had received the payment and asked when my refund would be processed ( the XXXX payment plus some escrow balance ). They originally advised with would take a couple of weeks but I was able to get someone to get special authorization to release the escrow funds early and the check ( in excess of {$1100.00} ) was supposed to be processed and mailed to me the week of the XXXX. I phone BofA this morning to find out what date my check had shipped and was told it was made out to the wrong payee ( XXXX with BofA admitted the payee had absolutely XXXX connection to my account and it was not a business name that I recognized ) and so now the delay was waiting for those funds to be redeposited into my "" account '' so they could issue the check to me properly. I asked if that was going to be done immediately and overnighted to me because they were not paying me any interest on my money that they are now holding without my permission yet I am paying interest on it elsewhere. XXXX was going to try to get it expedited and was going to see if perhaps it could be overnighted to me but that it might still take 3-5 business days."
Mortgage,"As late as XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America has informed me in writing by representing and stating to me, "" Further, Bank of America followed MHA and HAMP guidelines in processing your applications and you no longer have any loan principal balance ( you fail to specify how Bank of America has not followed MHA and HAMP guidelines during the several years that you have applied for a modification ). As a result, it is Bank of America 's position that your Complaint lacks a factual or legal basis. '' Bank of America represents that "" Based on the foregoing, you received decisions on all of your complete loan modification applications and appeals, as well as following MHA and HAMP guidelines. As a result, it is Bank of America 's position that your Complaint lacks a factual or legal basis. '' I am assuming complaint refers to CFPB complaints. 
Bank of America has never provided an appeal determination based on the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX MHA HAMP timely appeals to date. Just to be clear, appeal determinations are conducted by Appeal Specialists, not Customer Relationship Managers ( CRMs ) or single point of contacts ( SPOCs ). The only Appeal Depatment Appeal Specialist review and determination conducted and issued for this account on appeal was XX/XX/XXXX for a non MHA HAMP modification that I did not request, but rather it is required all borrowers be evaluated for all modifications as loss mitigation rules state a borrower must be concurrently evaluated for all bank and servicer modification programs on offer upon receipt of a complete application package at the time of initial review. 
Just to be clear, Bank of America has intentionally withheld material information relating to the true status of this account by misrepresenting the results of the appeal review and determination conducted on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America purposely refused to conduct and has withheld or delayed the issuance of the Appeals Department written determination on appeal upon receipt of my timely MHA HAMP appeal requests based on the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX incorrect MHA HAMP denial letters. Understand, I have only submitted one request for mortgage assistance ( RMA ) since XX/XX/XXXX, as confirmed, that has lead to the XX/XX/XXXX complete RMA received that resulted in the XX/XX/XXXX initial review and the subsequent XX/XX/XXXX incorrect MHA HAMP denial for which a timely appeal was requested that prompted the XX/XX/XXXX Appeal Deepatment Appeal Specialist review and issued Appeal Report granting XXXX XXXX and MHA HAMP TPP. However, I have not been provided with a written determination to date issued by an Appeals Department Appeal Specialist as there is no time requirement to inform a borrower of the results of the appeal review conducted by the Appeals Department. As a result, Bank of America has all the time in the world to employ unfair, poor and deceptive practices to separate me from my home and property during loss mitigation processes as the modification process remains incomplete and pending until thirty ( 30 ) days after a written determination on appeal has been issued by an Appeal Specialist of the Appeals Department. 
Bank of America has repeatedly conceded in writing there is no loan principal balance associated with this account. Thus, there can be no account default. 
It is unclear if Bank of America considers the non-judicial foreclosure process pending. Apparently, Bank of America insists on falsely and slanderously claiming a default on his account and the right, as a matter of law, to begin foreclosure processes by representing the non-judicial foreclosure has not concluded on or before XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America has represented to me the sale of XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust occurred on XX/XX/XXXX at Trustee 's Sale at public auction. 
All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and mandatory."

Mortgage,"This is a follow up complaint to Complaint XXXX. 

A second, distinct complaint is being made because, during a telephone conversation with a person who responded to ( XXXX ) XXXX on behalf of CFPB, the advice given us was to file an additional, new complaint. 

This new complaint, on review, we believe should be viewed as a substantive reply to the Response which the prospective lender gave to our first Complaint. That is what we intend. In a similar vein, we believe the second complaint in CFPB terminology is "" feedback. '' But before phoning and speaking with the person who responded to ( XXXX ) XXXX on behalf of CFPB, we provided formal feedback to your agency of a non-substantive nature regarding a telephone request we left on the voicemail of the person whose name is given as the preparer of the Response which the prospective lender gave to our first Complaint. Incidentally we have not received a response to that telephone request. 

Our Second Complaint and First Substantive Feedback to XXXX is as follows : Respectfully, in order to understand the Response, we believe we need - and so hereby request explanations of the following : 1. Why & how monthly income increased {$300.00} ( from {$10000.00} as advised on XX/XX/XXXX, to the Responses {$10000.00} ) or an increase of 2.9 %. 

This increase reduced the apparent shortfall in monthly income from {$220.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to {$86.00}, a reduction of 61 %. 

2. How our monthly debt ( unchanged from the Responses {$4900.00} ) is arrived at. At a minimum, the traditional meaning of debt is not being used to get to this figure. 

3. The rationale for saying ... no eligible income was omitted when the Response increased our monthly income by {$300.00} or 2.9 %. 

4. Failing to explain in any way our principal inquiry, namely, the failure of any gross-up for significant amounts of our income as to which there are no - or reduced income taxes, whether federal, state or both. 

5. What repetition of an explanation by Mr Allende? There had been none prior to the conversation we had. Nor did he give one. 

He merely said repeatedly there could be no reconsideration ( what we were then seeking ) or response at all, because our application was no longer before the appropriate lender person or entity. 

If anything further is necessary or appears helpful for responding to us in any regard, please inform us of it and we'll make every reasonable effort to provide it."
Mortgage,"I can give you more detail at a later date if needed but the condensed version is that I app applied and was accepted for a loan with Bank of America and through the process the amount that would be payable per month changed 4 times till literally the night before closing it was higher than I knew I could afford. I was not given that amount till I called my loan officer the night before because I did n't even know how much I was supposed to bring to the closing. I was n't given my final disclosure till 2 days AFTER the closing date!!!!

Mortgage,"I filed for bankruptcy XXXX 2012 and my attorney requested reaffirmation papers for my home and Bank of America did not respond. My home was excluded from the bankruptcy due to owing more than the house was worth. The credit bureaus report that my mortgage and equity loans were discharged and closed. I have paid my monthly payments through the bankruptcy and are up to date. I have tried to get Bank of America to reflect this to the credit reporting agencies, to no avail. I am requesting your assistance in correcting this matter."
Mortgage,My home was purchased XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$140000.00} the mortgage was sold several times with BofA being the final owner of the loan. There was a XXXX mortgage taken out with Countrywide of {$39000.00} when BofA purchased the loan from Countrywide the mortgage went from {$140000.00} to {$200000.00} my thought was the XXXX was included in the transfer to BofA. I have since been served with intent to foreclosure from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to have the deed for the XXXX from Countrywide in the amount of {$21000.00}. I have contacted BofA several times on this issue before I received the foreclosure documents from XXXX XXXX. No one can give me any answers on how my mortgage went from {$140000.00} to {$200000.00}! The auction sale of my home is to be XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I have had to hire an attorney to try to stop this foreclosure and to date I have not heard from BofA. I have not missed payments with BofA mortgage my account is current.
Mortgage,"I apologize that this complaint is being filed late - I only recently learned of the service that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection provides. This complaint is related to our mortgage with Bank of America for our property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX because our property was severely under-water ( we owed about {$300000.00} more than the property was worth ), we began the short-sale process. In XX/XX/XXXX, a buyer was identified and we sent the proposal to Bank of America. After months and months of delays, with numerous requests for more and more paperwork ( very frequently it was a request for information that had already been provided, several times XXXX, Bank of America finally approved the short sale. We received a letter from them ( see attached ) outlining the details of the approval. We complied with all requests. As you can see in the attached document, B of A indicated that we would receive {$22000.00} as part of a government program. Once the short-sale was approved, it took the buyer a little longer to get his financing approved - about 3 weeks. Because of this delay ( and despite the months of delay we had experienced with Bank of America XXXX, we were told that we were no longer eligible for the {$22000.00} because the program had expired. This seems very unfair to us because we had been diligent in complying with all the bank 's requests in a timely manner. Additionally, we had a credit card with Bank of America for many years ( unrelated to our mortgage with them XXXX. During the short-sale process, the bank sent us notice that our credit card was discontinued AND that we were no longer entitled to the rewards we had earned on the card ( rewards totaled about {$900.00} XXXX. It just seems that Bank of America acted unfairly with us."
Mortgage,"My father provided me with with a down payment for a house on XXXX acres of land in NH. My mortgage loan was approved for {$150000.00}. After the mortgage loan was approved, the seller stated that he would only complete the transaction if an additional XXXX acres was included in the sale for an additional {$60000.00}. We made a sales agreement for the additional land and paid for it directly to the seller. At the closing the mortgage and deed included the dwelling and the entire XXXX acres. The closing process should have deeded the dwelling and XXXX acres to me as approved on the mortgage application. The additional XXXX acres should have been deeded to my father and mother because they purchased that parcel of land on a cash basis. The original mortgage was held by "" Country Wide ' but is now held by Bank of America. Bank of America will accept an application for release of the XXXX acres. The request application carries a charge of {$500.00} and only provides a review of the situation. I think it is unfair to have to pay {$500.00} to Bank of America to consider my request. In fact, further review of the attached documents will clearly show the said XXXX acre tract was clearly purchased and paid for in-full at the closing. The XXXX acres of land in question, therefore, should not be included as security on the current mortgage loan."
Mortgage,"Telephone conference was scheduled for XXXX XXXX, 2016 at XXXX EST., with the Line of Credit Deparment and the assigned Resolution Specialist ( XXXX XXXX ).

Discrepancies due dates is it the XXXX of the month or the XXXX of the month and 5. Negative information being reported to the XXXX major credit bureaus. The Personal Banker was very helpful but it was upto the LOC to resolve my issues. I contacted XXXX XXXX and left a voice message asking her to contact me regarding our XXXX scheduled telephone meeting. Also, I contacted the LOC department and was placed on hold for approximately XXXX minutes or longer and was discounted. I visited the XXXX XXXX Branch on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and asked the associate to help with my checking account and the LOC and was told to contact the LOC department. This is not good customer service."
Mortgage,"I am selling my home. Bank of America holds the note. When I requested a payoff there was a miscellaneous fee totaling {$1700.00} attached to my payoff. This fee was not a pending mortgage payment or any type of lien, past due bill, tax or outstanding cost associated with the property. It is a fee that they could not explain and the person on the phone even described as strange. When the call was made to Bank of America mortgage division they could not explain what this cost was or had any documents to support how it came about. I have a pending closing that will be hampered by this. They would not escalate the issue for a faster turn around and said it would be 10 days to respond with a letter which would be after closing. Bank of America is demanding the additional {$1700.00} which is not even part of my original deed and has nothing documented that it is valid cost associated with my loan."
Mortgage,"I applied for a HELOC loan with bank of America Back in XXXX of XXXX. My application was accepted, and we were in the underwriting process. Bank of America found that there was a Lien still on my home and stated that they could not proceed unless the lien was released. Bank of America had done the loan modification for me back in XXXX as they were the holder of the note for my mortgage. Bank of America had sold the servicing to another company, and since then I had refinanced from the FHA loan to a Conventional loan. All notes were paid when I refinanced. I reached out to ISN for a copy of the lien release from the modification and they provided it. Bank of America 's underwriting department for the HELOC was still showing a Lein on my house however for the exact amount as the release. When I reached out to the county to get the paperwork that was filed, I was able to retrieve both the original and duplicated lien that they had filed. I am now unable to do anything with my house because of the duplicated lien. ISN has maintained that they do not have such recording of the duplicate, and that Bank of America needs to resolve the issue."
Mortgage,I am currently in a lawsuit as myself and Bank of America is named a defendants I have called Bank of America to ask what is their current interest in the property meaning is Bank of America the beneficiary or the Servicer of the loan Also has Bank of America forwarded the lawsuit to current Servicer if not Bank of America Bank of America current attorneys who sub into the case seems to be supporting plaintiff -when the ask if there is a current mortgage Bank of America remained quiet. As well as is Bank of America provided my mortgage balance pay off demand to a third party - HOA and if so how if Bank of America is not servicing loan.
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX we called Bank of America to let them know we were struggling and see if we could move a payment to the end of our loan. They said that we could get a loan modification and that would help out more. We were told to skip XXXX payment and start making the new lower payment on XXXX XXXX, then after 3 months it would be reviewed and we would know if we were approved. We were approved and everything was fine till XXXX when I made XXXX payment early on XXXX. I started getting phone calls on the XXXX saying I missed my payment. When I answered the phone we would have to go through a major ordeal that the loan was in my husbands name and that they could n't talk to me about it, we had send in a letter XXXX different times giving me permission to talk to them, it would work for XXXX or XXXX phone calls but then we would go through it all over again. They insisted that the payment I made was XXXX and would go all the way back to the payment they told me to skip saying they were all late. I received multiple harassing phone calls daily. It did n't matter how many times I explained they insisted I missed a payment. They never would assign me to just XXXX person to handle the account, I had to call and talk to several people and explain to each XXXX the whole story ( sometimes XXXX a call ). I would finally get someone who sounded like they knew what they were talking about only to be told to call back in XXXX hrs to see if it was fixed. We went through this for a year! Constant phone calls, no results. Finally in late XX/XX/XXXX we gave in and paid some of the fees that they said we owed just to be done with it, even though I have documentation that we never missed a payment. Last month XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a {$15.00} charge on my statement so I called to see what it was for. I was told it was due to a missed payment in XX/XX/XXXX, I explained the whole story and got the same run around, "" I 've submitted it for review, please call back in XXXX hrs to see if it is resolved ''. As of XXXX weeks later it still is not resolved."
Mortgage,"To Whom It May Concern, I have been fighting with Bank of America, hereinafter referred to as BOFA, for well over 6 years now. It has been about 3 years since there has been any real activity on my property. That all changed early last month. BOFA received the servicing of my loan from Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP while the loan, hereinafter referred to as debt, was in default for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. Since BOFA acquired the servicing on this debt, they have repeatedly and constantly harassed me for payment and have threatened to foreclose. I presently have a foreclosure date set for XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I understand that under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, hereinafter referred to as FDCPA, BOFA is a "" debt collector '' since they received the servicing rights while the alleged debt was in default. As a "" debt collector '' they are without legal authority or rights to attempt to collect payments and/or proceed with a non-judicial action against my property pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1692f ( 6 ) ( A ). My husband is now a XXXX  XXXX XXXX member and over the years we have moved around quite a bit. My property is home to me and my family. Although we may leave for a period of time, we do come back to our home. Today I found out that in mid-XX/XX/XXXX, BOFA had some workers go to my home and break the locks on my front gate to gain access to my property. Not only did they break the locks to my front gates, they broke into my home and disposed of some of my belongings I had in my property. Even if BOFA was a creditor, which they are not, entering on property without my permission is trespassing. Breaking my locks and breaking into my home is vandalism. Disposing my property is stealing. I am appalled at the actions of BOFA. BOFA 's actions are a blatant disregard for the law. Under the FDCPA, a debt collect may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect a debt. More specifically they may not take or threaten to possess or disable property when they have no enforceable right to the property. Lastly, BOFA is also in violation of the FDCPA because they are falsely representing the character, amount, and legal status of the debt. Over the years BOFA has told me they were the owners of the debt and then I was told XXXX was the owner of my debt. Pursuant to Commercial Code Section 3118, the statute of limitations for a note payable at a definite time shall commence within six years after the due date or due dates stated in the note, or if a due date is accelerated, within six years after the accelerated due date. The total amount was first accelerated in XXXX. The time for any collector to collect on this debt has expired. I am filing this complaint because I am beyond frustration and anger. I believe if I do not file a Complaint, they will continue to blatantly disregard the law and fraudulently and wrongfully foreclose on my home."

I am asking your agency to intercede on our behalf, the title agent has disclose you have strict regulations on time frames as to before the submission of a Loss Mitigation options as well as time frames after approval has been issued. 
How can they just go up and sell the loan to a servicer than according to my agent is known to foreclosed on the properties and not honor approvals. 
I do not know what to do, we fought so much to move this forward, now they want to take this away, is time these institutions get fined for taking advantage of consumers."

Mortgage,"UNAUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT ACCESS AND CONDUCT CONCERNS Bank of America has been providing my home loan mortgage account information to unauthorized third parties for years. During this time, XXXX the mortgage and service records associated with and related to my home loan mortgage account, the borrower Home Loan Modification Status iportal, the MHA HAMP, and the MHA HAMP TPP process have been mishandled, destroyed, withheld, and otherwise altered to my detriment. This conduct has been intentional on the part of Bank of America and is designed and implemented to coerce and harass through the use and employment of poor and deceptive practices as a matter of standard policy in and during the ordinary course of business with the intention to defraud borrowers of their home while violating written agreements including, but not limited to, the Deed of Trust. 
While Bank of America may hide behind the built-in, go to, standby, default excuse of individual representatives misconduct and their lack of knowledge and skills during and throughout any modification, workout, and loss mitigation processes, Bank of America has no excuses for allowing such conduct to continue and such open disregard for the various and applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, timelines, agreements and their own stated policies, procedures, and code of ethics ( assuming those ethics are in line with those regulated and governed by state and federal laws ). 
I have uploaded XXXX documents submitted with this complaint. I will submit at least XXXX additional documents to the CFPB under this complaint number once assigned later this date."
Mortgage,"I have XXXX loans with Bank of America. They were originally VA loans via Countrywide. BOA handles the servicing of the loans. Shortly after taking over the loan from CW, BOA began adding escrow reserve to my escrow account. My loan does not require me to use escrow servicing, it 's voluntary. Upon adding escrow reserve, BOA raised my minimum pmt. While paying the correct amount, BOA began to claim my payment was short of full. This lead to payments being considered late, late fees, etc. 

Additionally, BOA 's escrow servicing has repeatedly paid insurance to XXXX incorrectly. Payment from XXXX property made to a wrong XXXX. This lead to overpayment to XXXX and a refund to me ; meanwhile leaving the unpaid insurance account short ( as it was never properly paid ). This lead to a repeat of all said above in late fees, etc. 

Most recently, they began foreclosure proceedings on one of my rental properties. This despite having record of sufficient payment made each and every month. The first trustee called off the sale and sent the file back to BOA after I provided them my records. Now a new trustee has been appointed and they 've postponed the sale to review my information. I 'm quite tired of this continual process. 

I have a file XXXX '' thick of letters sent to BOA with minimal response and never any serious attempt at resolution. In my paperwork sent to BOA is included a spread sheet displaying all loans, payments for each year with taxes and insurance and my payments. It quite clearly shows that I 've paid more than was required. Despite this, they have each loan in error and it 's a complete mess. 

This is not the first occasion. In 2009, BOA admitted wrongdoing of all the above and corrected my accounting and all was set current. However, shortly thereafter the whole process began again. 

I 'm not sure if it is a predatory business practice or not, but I 'm sure I 'm not the only one experiencing this. My credit has been ruined and I 've been unable to close on transactions and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

I 've pleaded with BOA to have someone at high level work through the file and find resolution. No success."

Mortgage,"Good Morning CFPB- The BofA has continued to post sale dates while I am in a modification. The sale dates just get put back a few weeks or months as my income continues to increase. I have a pending complaint but the BofA response to your communication continues to be the same standard answer. The bank position is they are satisfied with their reply regarding their pattern of "" dual tracking '', illegal for the last 3 years in California. 

To this I would like to add new information. I once again have been declined for a modification, even though my income has doubled and I am able to pay the monthly statement I receive in the mail. The bank will NOT allow me to pay that amount. I spoke with a bank representative on behalf of my single point of contact. I asked him how much money do I have to earn to satisfy the bank 's demand. His response is that he does not have that information and that the investor sets the income amount. This brings up the 2nd complaint I filed regarding locating the investor. In brief, BofA names XXXX XXXX as investor. When I XXXX their response is that they are not the investor but the trustee for a consortium of ( unnamed ) investors under the umbrella of XXXX. XXXX is Countrywide, and BofA owns Countrywide. This is a deliberate tactic to make sure the homeowner has no access to any entity who claims to be the investor and no one who claims authorship over who sets sale dates, required income amount, etc. When I confront the BofA with this information they say my only avenue is to contact XXXX even after I just told the representative what I have just told you. 

I then told the BofA representative that I am actively interviewing for full time employment and that until I have a firm figure from the BofA regarding my monthly income requirement I can not determine a dollar amount for salary when asked by a potential employer. The BofA rep then told me in his opinion "" no amount of money would be enough. '' And with my sale date being XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the only option is a short sale. 

I much appreciate having this CFPB avenue to describe the position ( s ) BofA has put me and others in, and hope this Bureau will not be shut down due to the recent political election. Can you continue to work on behalf of my particular situation and others facing the same treatment? Once again I would like to mention that this is my family 's home since XXXX, I lost XXXX work due to the downturn of XXXX. I have been working when I can, using the money to restore this classic XXXX XXXX home here in the XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I started with an unlivable home generating no rental income, I am now able to remain on the property and generate {$XXXX} annual. And am working on the XXXX which will generate another {$XXXX}. With a full time job I could be generating a total of {$XXXX} annual. The current annual mortgage obligation is around {$54000.00}. 

Thank you for your continued support. Any cancellation or postponement of a sale date has allowed me to use the time constructively to increase my income, reestablish myself in my field and train in related fields, and continue to restore my home for optimum generation. I have become an activist on homeowners being able to be treated fairly by banks, and have brought this subject to my neighborhood council in which I am board member.

Mortgage,"Hi I am trying to get payoff information on my equity credit line attached to my house acct ending in XXXX that was charged off in XXXX but its still attached to my house. I went through bankruptcy but didnt include my house. There lies the problem.

After little or no help getting payoff and daily run around I sent an email to corporate customer service.

I contacted my attorney who helped me with my bankruptcy ( which I did not include my home in the bankruptcy but we never received communication from BOA concerning the second mortgage during the bankruptcy process so my attorney stated that I would just need to contact him if I have issues, which I did and he recommended I make a complaint with the XXXX and your FL Dept ) I have filed a XXXX  complaint and now filing with you.

I am at my wits end please help me before I lose the third closing with my approved buyer on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"I modified my mortgage with Bank of America in XXXX XXXX. I have paid my mortgage on time each month since that time. XX/XX/XXXX I receive a package from Bank of America stating that some of the documents from my modification contained errors that prevented them from recording the modification with the county. Included in the package were XXXX separate sections needing signatures : The Loan Modification Agreement, the Amended and Restated Note, and a third signature page with the words, "" Page XXXX of XXXX, '' on the bottom, missing any accompanying page XXXX for that particular page. It is a different font and format to either of the other sections, so it clearly is a separate section. 
The package offered a {$500.00} compensation for my inconvenience and offered to send a notary to our home at no cost. 
We ignored the first XXXX sets of paperwork but by the XXXX set we began questioning it. We brought it to an attorney who advised us not to sign it for at least XXXX reasons : the amended and restated note changes the terms of the original modification by adding an entire section titled Grounds for Acceleration of Debt ; and because of the section that includes a page XXXX without the accompanying page XXXX. This is not erroneous, as the packets came with this signature page and no page XXXX in each of the XXXX packets. 
When I called to inquire about these concerns, I was told that the page XXXX was a printing error, and that it was simply a continuation of the page XXXX of the Loan Modification Agreement but that both would still need to be signed. As I noted before, the font and format of these pages are completely different and thus the mortgage company lied to me and is deliberately hiding something from me. They are trying to pressure me into signing this page with false information. With regard to my concern about the additional terms that change the original modification I agreed to, they simply said it had to be signed or the modification would not be recorded and I would have issues when trying to sell the property. 
I am trying to put the property on the market and need this resolved before we find a buyer, otherwise Bank of America 's mistakes will cost me a lot of money. This entire situation is suspicious due to the fact that six years have passed since the final paperwork was signed but only now they 're trying to fix whatever mistake they really made. I need answers and I believe Bank of America 's actions are unethical at best and criminal and fraudulent at worst. 
I have included XXXX sets of documents ; the XXXX is the packet we received XX/XX/XXXX and the XXXX is the original documents from our modification. I have additional documentation if needed."
Mortgage,"I am disputing my Bank of America HELOC loan ACCOUNT # XXXX. 

Bank of America Home Loans has notified me multiple times that my HELOC mortgage is at a zero balance. Multiple times they have offered to mail me a paid in full letter and release of lien letter. I have written correspondence dated XX/XX/2016, from Bank of America XXXX Home Equity Line of Credit servicing company, stipulating the following : If you have a second mortgage Once your first mortgage is permanently modified under HAMP, a second mortgage on the same property may be eligible for a modification under the Second Lien Modification Program ( 2MP ). 

My lender advised me numerous times that my HELOC had a XXXX balance and had been charged off and that my debt on the referenced account was eligible under the United States Treasury 2MP guidelines for a full extinguishment of my HELOC loan. 

I have been misled, decided, and discriminated by Bank of America."
Mortgage,"I lost my job in 2009 and had to move to another state to work. I had to walk away from my home XXXX. Bank of America went to the courts for the permission to recover the home, which the court granted. It has been XXXX years and BoA refuses to finalize the foreclosure because it is not worth it for them finish. This is holding my family hostage. My wife and son both suffer XXXX. Living in limbo and not having a home of our own is having profound impacts on my family. I am a XXXX veteran who needs to buy a home here XXXX, but I ca n't move forward with my life, because BoA is treating my situation unfairly."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is a XXXX participating servicer. XXXX allows for full lien extinguishments I requested and was told that I qualified for full extinguishment of my second loan ( Loan # XXXX ) after I provided all requested documents to Bank of America including the XXXX Certification, XXXX Certification and Occupancy Certification form. I have not received the full extinguishment as promised by Bank of America and have been waiting. 
Under the XXXX Lien Modification Program ( XXXX ), when a borrower 's first lien is modified under the Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ), a participating XXXX servicer, in accordance with any applicable pooling and servicing agreement or other investor servicing agreement, the XXXX servicer may elect to partially or fully extinguish a second lien. 
Effective XXXX 2013, Treasury expanded the XXXX program to include qualifying first liens that have been modified under the XXXX Standard Modification requirements. When a borrower 's XXXX lien is modified under the XXXX Standard Modification requirements and the first lien satisfies the HAMP eligibility criteria, the XXXX servicer must offer to modify or extinguish the borrower 's second lien under XXXX. 
I was told that through the extinguishment program, Bank of America will report to the major credit bureaus that the my second lien mortgage is now "" paid and closed '' and has a XXXX balance."
Mortgage,"I purchased my home in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX. My mortgage was with Bank of America.The closing was rushed and I was never told about XXXX, XXXX also attests that he was never informed of a mortgage with XXXX.My payments always went to Bank of America.There was never a payment sent to XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I lost my job due to XXXX. I applied for a modification which took forever to process because Bank of America stated documents were lost, after I sent them in countless times BOA stated that they needed additional information which had already been sent in. I was finally approved for a modification of around {$740.00} ( unsure of exact amount ). I began making these payments strictly off of my unemployment income. Not soon after I began making payments, a new governor was elected in XXXX ( XXXX ), and he enacted a law that would cancel emergency extended unemployment which completely canceled my unemployment income. My XXXX is XXXX and the XXXX of BOA refusing to process my paperwork in a timely manner began to affect my XXXX, and I began to XXXX and had to have XXXX. XXXX this was taking a toll on me as all I could think of was Bank of America calling me sometimes 3 times a day every day of the week wanting to know when I can make a payment and I had just gotten out of the hospital! I then applied for another modification due to the change in circumstances and this time they came back with an even higher amount due of around {$990.00} which I could n't pay without any unemployment income coming in. I believe this entire time they were still processing the modification as though XXXX was on the mortgage even though he previously signed a quit claim deed. Bank of America also neglected to inform XXXX and I that "" Assumption paperwork '' needed to be filled out at that time. I had found out years later by a BOA acct manager who stated that the assumption paperwork was never submitted. I asked "" What was the assumption paperwork? '' and she stated that it should have been done with the quit claim deed. We were never informed of that. So, I then had to start the modification process again asking them to not include XXXX or child support payments. They again increased the mortgage and it 's continually been a battle since then.The last statement amount to pay was over {$1200.00} Bank of America wants to foreclose on my home and has a hearing date of XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX County, XXXX. Bank of America has hired a substitute trustee to represent them. The substitute trustee is XXXX, Foreclosure dept. XXXX, Firm case no. XXXX ( XXXX ). The attorney over this account is XXXX.I believe the trustee is XXXX. 
The paperwork that was filed in the General Court of Justice states that the noteholder intends to commence foreclosure on the note and deed of trust dated XX/XX/XXXX held by XXXX ... .no one ever signed on with any paperwork from XXXX! They also claim that they are going to '' accelerate '' due to non-payment when the negligence has consistently been from Bank of America not honoring good practices when they were aware of the hardship they placed on me and my family by not admitting to their wrongdoing.The beneficiary mortgage is XXXX.Please do not allow the servicer XXXX to foreclose on my home. I am waiting for The Bank of America to respond to my "" Produce the Note '' request. They have not responded as of yet. 

It would be a hardship for me to attend the foreclosure hearing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX in the XXXX, XXXX County, General Court of Justice. I am now in XXXX due to the bullying tactics of Bank of America and appraisal inspectors knocking on my door. The XXXX was just too much. I thought about selling the house"

Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX We found ourselves in XXXX not able to make our house payments and other financial obligations. We applied to BOA for a loan modification in XXXX of XXXX and continued to petition them for relief under the new modification programs offered by the government. We knew very little about the process itself, so we went along for some time, sending them everything they asked for only to be denied, SENT INCOMPLETE PAPERWORK, or told we did not qualify for this or that type of program, BUT to resubmit our documents again and again. At XXXX point they sold our loan to XXXX and then almost immediately bought it back. Very confusing and again resulted in more packets having to be sent in. 
There was a period of time when we could not get any response from BOA and finally I went to a branch in XXXX refusing to leave until I was able to talk with someone face to face. Again, we filled out documents and brought XXXX XXXX ( a consumer advocate who had helped other homeowners achieve a loan modification ) into the negotiation process. After speaking with XXXX, we were referred to the Office of the president, Social Media Team of Bank of America. It seemed to make some progress, but very slowly. Long story short, after three years of this process BOA finally offered a loan modification that was {$600.00} MORE per month than our original payment. IN ADDITION, to bring the loan current we would have to pay {$85000.00} to be back to our original payment. During the time of our modification process BOA was pursuing foreclosure while we were in a current workout program. It was my understanding that this was an illegal process called dual tracking in the mortgage industry. 
The offer was absolutely NOT a modification and a workable proposal, it indicated to us that BOA did not want to help us but wanted to be able to take our home for some reason unknown to us. We came to the decision to file a chapter XXXX bankruptcy to eliminate the debtand get a fresh start. We surrendered the house in the chapter XXXX and was advised by our attorney to not vacate until the deed changed over to the bank as we would still be responsible for the property. We were given notice again that our house has a sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We are not attempting to retain possession of the home, but to petition BOA for a reasonable offer of compensation for the stress that this whole situation has caused us. We feel it is our duty to report the bad customer service, deceit, and improper if not illegal handling of our loan modification. It is our hope that your office will research BOA and prevent other families from having to go through this process. Three years is too long for anyone to have to wait to eventually lose their home. I believe that Bank of America should be obligated to make restitution to people like us for their mishandling of our case. There is NO excuse that can be given. I would like BOA to offer us a low interest rate loan for a smaller home which would be affordable for our current financial status. We have had stable income for over two years and are ready to move on with our life. We submit this respectfully and with confidence in the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX As of this date BOA did not pursue the sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX and again, no communication from anyone at Bank of America. Bank of Americas attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX out of XXXX has contacted us recently indicating that they will be pursuing the foreclosure of our home. We understand that this will take place, but since the original submitting of our original complaint we have had no conversation from BOA regarding any financial compensation or other offer as we had requested. Again we will leave the home upon the transfer of the deed and are not trying to retain possession of the home. We ha"
Mortgage,"I had original loan with Bank of America for 30 years, which I do not have escrow with them. They were falsely calculate my principal and interest, which lead to false amortization table for my loan. They need to correct the number start on XX/XX/XXXX for me. 
In XX/XX/XXXX they sold my loan to XXXX. My loan at that time had property tax delinquent in the amount of {$21000.00}, so XXXX Mortgage put our loan to escrow with them. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I sent in exact amount of {$21000.00} to pay off the tax delinquent, and request them to close the escrow account for me, but they did not apply my money to pay for the negative escrow. Instead they put my money into the principal so they can keep us escrow with them. At the same time, they jacked up the monthly payment to create the scene that we could not afford to pay for our monthly payment, That way they could proceed the foreclose procedure. I had file a complain to CFPB number XXXX in the year XXXX. At that time I was in contact with one of XXXX employer name XXXX. He kept asking me to wait for the escrow department to fix the monthly payments for me. I waited from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. He sent me an email saying i have to do escrow with them, and said the company is asking me to pay my regular monthly payment in the amount of {$4600.00}. In XXXX I saw they put all fees and charges over {$3000.00} into my loan, so i sent him email to ask him why? He again, asked me to wait for the company to adjust those fees for me. I waited till XX/XX/XXXX, nothing had been corrected. So in the year XXXX i sent total {$21000.00} + XXXX XXXX = {$23000.00} for my escrow account. My property tax year XXXX was {$6300.00} + {$6700.00} = {$13000.00}. 
I added the whole tax year which XXXX sent 2 payment to the tax collector in the amount of {$13000.00} to my negative {$21000.00} = {$34000.00}. 
so if i subtract the {$34000.00} - {$23000.00} = {$10000.00}. This was the negative in escrow account for the year XXXX. This amount by XX/XX/XXXX was totally different from what XXXX mortgage had on my XX/XX/XXXX statement which showed escrow balance in the amount of {$17000.00}. So the different here is {$17000.00} - XXXX = {$6000.00}. Please explain this amount. 
In the XXXX year, XXXX collected my escrow in the amount of {$18000.00}. 
My property tax in XXXX was {$13000.00}. 
So in the XXXX year I used $ XXXX {$13000.00} = {$5000.00}. This is extra money from my payments. 
If i use the negative {$10000.00} carried over from the XXXX year - extra {$5000.00} in the 2015 year = {$5900.00}. This is the negative they supposed to have by the end of year XXXX. 
In the year XXXX XXXX collected my escrow payment in the amount of {$13000.00} for XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX which are total 7 months. 
XXXX sent out one payment to the tax collector in the amount of {$6800.00} I used my payments {>= $1,000,000} - {$6800.00} = {$6900.00} This amount was my extra payment to XX/XX/XXXX. 
I used {$6900.00} - the negative carried over from XXXX which is $ XXXX {$960.00}. 
Which meant when XXXX sold my loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. I supposed to have extra {$960.00}, instead of - {$5000.00} which XXXX told us that 's our Negative escrow from XXXX. 
For XXXX they collected my escrow total {$11000.00} from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. They only paid 5 months tax for me in the amount of {$1100.00} X 5 = {$5700.00}. 
I used {$11000.00} - {$5700.00} = {$6100.00}. This is the extra money I paid to XXXX. 
They finally let me closed the escrow account by XX/XX/XXXX. The only sent me the check in the amount of {$.00}. instead of {$6100.00}. 
All these companies were falsely applied my payments to my loan, and messed up my Amortization table. 
I demand correct detail of my Amortization table up to XX/XX/XXXX from all three companies, and refund my extra money back to me. Thanks."
Mortgage,"We had a first mortgage, second mortgage ( home equity loan ), and third mortgage ( home equity line of credit, {$10000.00} ) all with Bank of America on our home in XX/XX/XXXX. The bank foreclosed on the property in XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, the first and second mortgages were canceled. The second mortgage was completely forgiven in XX/XX/XXXX as part of the bank 's settlement with the Department of Justice. But the bank did n't do anything about the third mortgage. 

During the foreclosure process, the bank told us to keep paying the third mortgage until the process is completed. We have been making the monthly payments on-time every month in spite of the fact that the property has been foreclosed and subsequently sold by the bank. 

Now the bank tells us that our monthly payment amount will triple. We have tried to call the bank and show them that this loan was supposed to be included in the original foreclosure. They now tell us that the home equity loan department and mortgage department do n't use the same system, therefore the information about the foreclosure was n't shared between them at the appropriate time.

Mortgage,"This complaint is in regards to discrepancies between Bank of America and funding from Hardest Hit. There are additional issues around the lack of timeliness and the lack of answering customer inquiries.In the XX/XX/XXXX I made several attempts to meet with BOA in person in order to discuss the loan modification process. I was told that they would not meet with me at the local BOA even though I stated that I had an extenuating circumstance and could not travel any farther at that time. They suggested I complete the process via mail. In XXXX the loan modification application was sent to me. I completed the application and it was XXXX back to BOA on XX/XX/XXXX. 
BOA was to call me on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that they had received my application. No call was received. I called BOA and was told that the documents I had sent were not received. Over the next six weeks, and numerous phone calls later, I was able to confirm that the application was received ( I was told it was there the whole time but the customer service rep missed seeing it ) but that the application was incomplete because of missing documentation. Additional documents were sent ( which were not included in the original packet ). I waited for these documents and then returned them. After the documents were received I was informed again that I needed to fill out more documents. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. I called to inquire if the required documents had been sent and I was told, by the customer service rep, that she left early because of a snow storm. We spoke again on Monday and the documents had still not been sent. I called on Tuesday and was told the documents were still on her desk. It was at this point I contacted XXXX XXXX, who assisted me with my Hardest Hit application, and met with them on XXXX XXXX. As of that date I still had not received from BOA the rest of the required documents for the loan modification. The same customer service rep was assigned to my file from XXXX through XXXX. From XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with several BOA employees from various departments in order to get my questions answered regarding what appear to be billing discrepancies ( please see attached documentation ). Not one person could address any of my questions. XXXX employees stated, after looking at their screens, "" I do n't understand. '' As a side note, I tried to complete the entire loan modification process before the XXXX when I had XXXX XXXX surgeries and was in a XXXX through XXXX. And there is yet another impending surgery. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX I have had at least XXXX, if not more, customer service reps. These reps have not been able to answer a single question, they have passed me along to other departments, who did the same, and have had their assistants return calls. XXXX XXXX Center has also made extensive efforts on my behalf with similar results. 

The issues and time lines are attached. 
Most recently on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with the customer service rep to confirm our XXXX phone meeting on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss foreclosure. We confirmed that she would call me at XXXX central time and I confirmed my number again. I offered to talk to her right then but she said that she was waiting on numbers. I did not receive a call at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I left the house at XXXX and did not return home until later in the evening. 
I have done everything that has been asked of me. 

Recently the State of Illinois declared me XXXX. I am moving forward on applying for another loan modification. It is critical that I stay in my home until I recover from my next surgery. 
Your assistance is deeply appreciated."
Mortgage,"I originally submitted the below complaint on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the Bank of America. The CFPB responded last week and said the Bank of America would be in direct contact to me but I have not heard anything over a week later- I have been told this is quite odd. Please ask the Bank of America to forward me their response and please send me the response that the Bank of America said it was going to forward to you the XXXX. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX "" Dear XXXX, We want to know how the Bank of America allowed the Bank of XXXX XXXX to transact XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Michigan in XX/XX/XXXX given that the Bank of America had first lien position on the property. According to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Bank of XXXX XXXX still has not released its lien position which contradicts the title work that I and my wife , XXXX XXXX XXXX were given at closing on XX/XX/XXXX. We had tried to address this issue with both banks but nobody has replied and details are outlined in the attached letter. Thank you, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ''"
Mortgage,"I currently have a Bank of America first mortgage and I have been trying to refinance my first mortgage. 

Once the refinance process was started and title work was initiated it was discovered that there was a lien on my property as a second note.. Bank of America did do a modification to my loan in 2013 in which the payment and terms were adjusted. During the negotiation of the modification Bank of America never stated that they would be placing a new/2nd lien on my property. 
I have spent over eight months trying to identify who owns & services this lien and how I can achieve a payoff. I have contacted Bank of America, HUD and FHA on numerous occasions and none of them will take ownership of this second lien. Bank of America has told me numerous times that they do not own the lien and do not know anything about it. HUD and FHA have both told me several times that they are not servicer 's of loans and do not hold notes. 
So at this point I am very frustrated with Bank of America, HUD and FHA because I can not get any answers on this lien on my property. If no one owns this second then how and why is showing on my title??? 
With this Phantom lien on my property I am not able to refinance my mortgage nor would I be able to sell my home if I wanted to or had to. I am stuck and feel scammed."
Mortgage,"This is a follow up to complaint number XXXX, which was originally submitted on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Bank of America sent me a letter yesterday ( XXXX XXXX, 2016 ), which was addressed to me and my husband. While my husband is on the mortgage with me, I submitted the complaint on my own behalf. I question BofA 's decision to include my husband, who was not named in my complaint, on the letter. While privacy laws allow the bank to do this, as he is jointly liable on the obligation, I wonder why the bank would share information concerning my dispute with someone I did not name in my complaint. 
Anyway, I am attaching the letter BofA sent me to this complaint, sent from XXXX XXXX, of the XXXX Customer Care Resolution Team. The letter states that "" ... .this communication is from a debt collector. '' The letter itself is sent from Bank of America, not a servicer. Accordingly, I 'm interpreting this letter to mean that BofA, by virtue of calling itself a "" debt collector, '' is subjecting itself to liability under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If that is not the case, then I assert that this statement is designed to intimidate consumers who have either filed an official complaint or have exerted their rights in some other fashion. 
That same disclosure goes on to state that IF the recipient is in bankruptcy or has obtained a discharge ( neither applies to me ), then this letter is for "" informational purposes only and is not an attempt to collect a debt, a demand for payments, or an attempt to impose personal liability for a discharged debt. '' Accordingly, the implication of this statement is that if the recipient is NOT in bankruptcy, or has NOT obtained a discharge, then this letter is NOT for informational purposes only, and that it IS an attempt to collect a debt. The language of this disclosure contradicts itself in many ways, and contradiction/overshadowing in the context of collections gives rise to a claim under the FDCPA, as well as federal and state UDAAP/UDAP laws. 
In the letter, BofA states they need more time to research my complaint and their "" goal '' is to respond to me by XXXX XXXX, which is tomorrow. I 'm not sure what the delay is -- if BofA had proper vendor management programs in place, they 'd be able to determine which of their debt collection vendors personally visited my home and left a debt collection notice on my front door. In my previous complaint I also forgot to mention that after the debt collector came to my home, the very next day I received a XXXX package from BofA with loan modification and assistance information -- again, over a matter of {$74.00}, which I am willing, able and desperate to pay if the bank would only fix the payment issue once and for all and tell me what the actual monthly payment is. The XXXX package coming on the heels of multiple phone calls and the debt collector coming to my home serves to put pressure on me and makes me feel afraid of what the bank will do, even though none of this is my fault. The bank seems comfortable taking its time with its research, while my mortgage payments are falling late, I am being assessed late fees, my credit bureau is taking hard hits -- all because the bank ca n't figure out what I owe. That does n't seem fair -- they take their time, and the result is that I get punished. 
Please note that if this matter is not resolved timely to my full satisfaction, I will file a class action lawsuit in the XXXX XXXX of Illinois, including the claims from my original complaint as well as the XXXX issue and the conflicting language from the letter referenced in this follow up. I also note that my homeowners insurance, which is what caused the payment discrepancy, is through an entity that is related to Bank of America -- meaning they raised my rates unilaterally and then punished me for it by not letting me pay."
Mortgage,"My uncle died last year. He had a balance on his home equity loan which I have been paying the monthly charges on while the courts were working on approving his estate. In XXXX I received Orders of Summary which I sent to the Bank of America Estate Department via email ( Ironically the BOA rep gave me the case worker 's PERSONAL email address. ) When I did not hear back I called and spoke to the rep. I completed the paperwork provided and gave instructions that I wanted to pay-off and close the HELOC. I did not hear back and subsequently the house was sold. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted BOA to get wire transfer instructions and a pay-off amount. ( Almost all their branches were closed in FL due to the pandemic. ) Rather than given wire instructions I was provided the address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX TX XXXX Mail Code TX XXXX. I sent a cashier 's check for the pay-off ( {$23000.00} ) along with a copy of the Orders of Summary and asking for a mortgage satisfaction and a closure of the account. I was also told to fax my request. I did that on XX/XX/XXXX and received notification that the fax was successfully transmitted. Since the loan had not been paid off I also sent another {$130.00} personal check to make sure the loan would be paid off and the mortgage satisfaction received. 

I have waited on hold at least 10 times ( once for 1 hour and 54 minutes, anther time for 2 hours and 10 minutes ). I have been given multiple case numbers and yet the cashier 's check has never been cashed and the loan is now past due. I even posted on XXXX that I needed assistance. BOA indicates they are prioritizing this issue but no one calls me back or emails me. I did receive a form letter in the mail staying they received written communication and will provide a written response of their findings. 

BOA keeps telling me that their conversion did not "" go well '' but I'm sorry this is ridiculous. My uncle 's home is being sold at the end of the month so I am having to have the HELOC paid from the proceeds."
Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I applied to Bank of America ( "" BOA '' ), the servicer for XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ), the lender, for a HAMP Tier 2 loan modification of my mortgage loan no. XXXX, secured by my rental property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MD XXXX ( the "" Property ' ). I transmitted my loan modification application on the BOA required Request For Mortgage Assistance form ( "" RMA '' ), dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, copy attached. BOA then mailed to me a XXXX XXXX, XXXX, letter, copy attached, which letter denied my RMA application for a HAMP 2 modification. The XXXX reasons stated by BOA are stated on the bottom of pg. XXXX and the top of pg. XXXX of the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX BOA letter. The first reason, at the bottom of pg. XXXX, states that the lender DB has not given BOA the authority to modify my loan under the HAMP. The second reason, at the top of pg. XXXX, states alleged reasons which are vague at best. For example, the "" proposed modified monthly payment '' is not disclosed. Secondly, the manner in which the "" proposed modified monthly payment '' was determined is not disclosed. Third, the document which sets "" the required range of XXXX % to XXXX % '' is not disclosed. Fourth, where I fit into the range is not disclosed. Fifth, the calculation formula for the "" verified income '' is not disclosed. I took the opportunity, given on pg. XXXX of the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX letter, to ask for a reevaluation. I faxed XXXX fax transmission sheets, a copy of each sheet attached, with my reevaluation request in the form of a new RMA, dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, copy attached, and with an updated Hardship Affidavit, dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, copy attached. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I faxed to BOA a fax transmission sheet and a revised pg. XXXX, copy attached, of the new RMA, dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Again, BOA denied my application for a loan modification. BOA 's denial letter, dated, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, copy attached, gave as the denial reason that my application did not satisfy an alleged NPV Formula to which BOA allegedly had applied XXXX separate factors without stating the manner in which the XXXX factors have been applied to the XXXX Formula. I then sent BOA a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, copy attached, which listed XXXX reasonable requests on pages XXXX and XXXX of my letter. BOA has ignored my reasonable requests. BOA 's denial of my loan modification application and BOA 's failure to respond to my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX letter under all the facts and circumstances manifest BOA 's bad faith in the processing of my loan modification application."
Mortgage,"BoFa was supposed to close my home loan on XX/XX/XXXX. BoFa 's underwriting department decided on XX/XX/XXXX to change the terms of my loan, and classified my home as non-owner occupied. They told me I need to pay a 25 % down payment, they took away {$2000.00} in lender credit and charged me {$2100.00} in loan amount points. They changed my interest rate from 3.375 % to 3.500 %. BoFa had a promotion going on that if I brought in $ XXXX in new money to BoFa, then they will give me a .25 % reduction in my loan. I brought the $ XXXX over to BoFa and my new interest rate should have been 3.125 %. Underwriting never gave me an explanation on why my place is considered non-owner occupied. I told BoFa that I do n't plan on moving. The seller was purchasing another property, so I did not have time to shop around for another bank. I had no choice but to close with BoFa. BoFa dragged out closing this loan, and I closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I purchased the property that I lived in for the last two years, and the owner did not involve a realtor in the sale of the property. I kept telling BoFa that the non-owner occupied classification was a mistake, but they would not correct this. The loan officers told me that underwriting has already made their decision. It is not right they told me this right before closing. I have no idea how to fight this or what my rights are at this point."
Mortgage,"A settlement account with Bank of America has been paid off since XXXX. Although I have made repeated requests to have the information updated on my credit report, Bank of America has not taken the necessary steps to address the issue and continues to reflect inaccurate information."
Mortgage,"I was notified in am email on XX/XX/XXXX that Bank of America would be updating their home loan system between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. After XX/XX/XXXX everything was supposed to be finished and I should have been able to access my account. As of XX/XX/XXXX I was still unable to access my account as it had been removed from my user account profile, so I sent them a message to ask what was going on with the account and if there was something that I needed to do on my end. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a reply back from them informing me that my issue would be best resolved if I contacted them by phone. I called the phone number provided and was informed once I got into the queue that the wait time would be over 90 minutes. This is an unacceptable amount of time to wait to have this issue addressed. I wrote them in the first place, so I did not have to wait an eternity on hold only to get dropped part way through the call, which I did."
Mortgage,"My loan is not escrowed. I pay for my own taxes and insurance. I also have an adequate insurance coverage amount and type for my loan amount. I also timely pay my property taxes. I have provided proof of adequate coverage to Bank of America repeatedly and consistently since the beginning of my loan. Despite this, Bank of America is continually adding money to my principal and interest amount as "" escrow. '' As this is not part of my loan I do not pay this amount and Bank of America then classifies my payment as late generating late fees. I pay the contractually required amount, have adequate insurance and pay my taxes and insurance on time. I do not know what I am being charged for that is an escrowed item as there are no escrows on this loan account. I have confirmed with Bank of America repeatedly that the insurance amount is proper. 
I have XXXX fire/dwelling policies and XXXX flood policies covering this property. The property has a front and a rear building which and each building is insured separately. 
I have a total XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX dollars in fire coverage and a total of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX in flood insurance. On the front building my fire coverage is {$250000.00} with {$120000.00} in flood. On the rear building I have {$140000.00} in fire and {$140000.00} in flood insurance. Bank of America spoke with my agent and approved the amounts of all insurance in several phone calls. 
Despite repeated assurances of adequate coverage, Bank of America has not charged with force gap coverage for a policy which costs an additional {$3000.00} per year even though the underlying insurance only costs {$1300.00} dollars, and once again, after expressly approving the amounts selected with my insurance agent on multiple occasions. I and my insurance agent have been calling every six weeks or so. This past time we called Bank of America could not provide and explanation as to why due to "" system issues '' ( XXXX XXXX ). We were told that Bank of America could not explain why the force placed coverage can not be removed and refused to provide any further answers. 
XXXX manager XXXX ID XXXX, stated that the issue was because they did n't have declarations pages for "" prior years ''. This is the first time that anyone has stated they were missing declarations pages. Bank of America has charged me various amounts over the past several months in violation of our loan agreement and seemingly arbitrarily."
Mortgage,"My initial complaint against Bank of America was filed on XX/XX/XXXX, complaint # XXXX. 
Since that time, despite, multiple letters from both attorneys and employees representing Bank of America ... .none of the correspondences have included : 1-Explanation of steps Bank of America has taken 2-Explanation on what steps exactly Bank of America intends on taking .

Instead the letters have not only been grossly incorrect is stating the problems but adversarial.

I've had 2 different law firms send me letters informing me of Bank of America hiring them to represent Bank of America. 

Each time, each attorney claims to be the direct contact person for Bank of America. 

The XXXX XXXX XXXX firm, located in my state, provided a number to a third party for me to call for any questions. I called and the company asked if I was attempting to REFINANCE my loan. I informed them NO. I've NEVER requested for a refinance. I've NEVER completed any application for a refinance. Unfortunately, this is another example of how it appears Bank of America 's plan is to not only assist and correct the errors they made but to INTIMIDATE, CONFUSE and intentionally deflect any/all culpability. 

Then, XXXX XXXX ( who I've left numerous phone messages ) has failed to respond to my messages. As a Resolution XXXX with Bank of America, this is poor customer service. 

I was even contacted by Bank of America as the letter stated I had to pay up to {$1800.00} in administrative fees because I, according to Bank of America, was requesting to give up part of my property for an easement ( Subordination of Easement ). 

I had to explain to the Bank of America XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that was not the case instead, I was attempting to have both my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX corrected since Bank of XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and those legally representing my closing interests ) failed do so. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX was gracious enough to listen to me explain the issues. She then informed me the Subordination of Easement was wrong and that she was not informed of the Easement issues. 

Again, this confirms that not only is Bank of America not transparent to reporting accurate information to regulatory agencies but Bank of America is even less transparent at sharing vital information to both it's own employees and customers. 

XXXX XXXX, Bank of America XXXX XXXX, referred to me by XXXX also refuses to respond to emails, and phone messages. 

Each time I receive letters from Bank of America they too state they're the contact person for Bank of America regarding this matter. Yet, they too, NEVER respond. In addition, they never provide contact numbers or email which leaves me having to call Bank of America for days trying to track down a number or email to these employees. And, even then, they simply don't and won't respond. 

It's clear Bank of America has no desire to help me as their mortgage client. 

It should also be noted to that I've consistently paid my mortgage since XXXX Below is an email I sent to Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who like most Bank of America employees will not return phone calls/, emails. 

Forwarded Message -- -- - From : "" XXXX XXXX '' XXXX To : "" XXXX '' XXXX Sent : Tue, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM Subject : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I've received numerous letters from Bank of America since filing a regulatory complaint. 

I was recently contacted (, via letter XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NC XXXX, informing me they represent Bank of America and conducting a title search. 

In addition, the letter stated if I decide not pursue the loan, no further action is required. And, call XXXX for any questions. 

I'm confused. I've already been in my home almost 12 years. 

I called XXXX and they asked was a doing a refinance. 
I AM NOT DOING A REFINANCE. IVE NEVER REQUESTED A REFINANCE. 

What is going on???? 

Additionally, I received ( XX/XX/XXXX ) another letter from another Bank of America employee XXXX XXXX. ( Resolution Specialist/Regulatory Complaint ). I've tried calling her and have left several messages ( XXXX Pin XXXX ), yet she's fail to reach out to me. 

Also on XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX, Specialty Service Advocate III, Partial Release, Mortgage and Vehicle Servicing Operations ( XXXX ext. XXXX ). I was informed there's a Subordination of my Easement initiated by Bank of America. However, that too was incorrect. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( approximately around that time ) Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), informing me he would be the contact person as he has been hired by Bank of America to work with me in resolving issues with my DEED of Trust.

I asked him if represented me and was working on correcting the issues surrounding my Deed, and since he's legal counsel for Bank of America would Bank of America pay any/all fees associated with correcting the issues. To date, I've yet to hear from him or get any additional responses.

Bank of America is having multiple people send me letters and each claiming to be the point of contact. Yet, none are available to provide feedback more less assist. 

Instead, it's just a maze of confusion I believe is intentionally orchestrated to discourage and ignore my claim ( s ), in hopes I will go away. This should not be difficult to believe considering fact I've been requesting assistance from Bank of America since XXXX in regards to the multiple issues surrounding my Deed. 

It's equally disappointing and definitely not consumer friendly that NOONE seems to be able to provide me an extension number to you. 

What is going on? 

XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"New details on a previous complaint I made have been brought to my attention ; I am requesting proof that Bank of America had an "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -- XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' in the summer/fall of 2015. 

For reference, I am attaching official paperwork I signed/received during my mortgage application process during that time. 

Thank you, XXXX"
Mortgage,"It appears the debt attached to the XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust associated with my account may have been sold multiple times between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, and not through a Trustee 's Sale at public auction as represented to me and the public by Bank of America and their named Trustee, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). This deliberate action amounts to fraud ( a knowingly false representation ) on a mortgage, Deed of Trust, or real estate and property and possibly Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act violations as prohibited by law. 

While Bank of America through XXXX caused to be recorded at least one Trustee 's Deed the next business day following Trustee 's Sale at public auction according to county records, Bank of America, through Trustee XXXX, took eleven ( 11 ) days to record a Trustee 's Deed related to my property after the day of auction and sale without explanation as to why such a delay occurred. On the face of it, the reason appears to be the withholding of the recording of a public document until a named bona fide purchaser ( BFP ) XXXX be had and named within and on the Trustee 's Deed, an official public document, thereby attempting to avoid any appearance of unlawful activity related to a mortgage, Deed of Trust, or real property. 

It is to be noted Bank of America has no authority to begin foreclosure and property separation processes while the modification process is pending, as a matter of law. 

All applicable Acts and other regulations, statutes, guidelines, and rules of law. 

All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and mandatory."
Mortgage,"Our mortgage Acct # : XXXX w/Bank of America was paid off on XX/XX/20. We forgot to turn off auto pay and a payment of {$5400.00} went out of our XXXX XXXX account via bill pay to Bank of America on XX/XX/20. Bank of America received the payment and accepted electronically. The payment was deducted from our XXXX account. 

We first contacted XXXX XXXX and BofA on XX/XX/20 to inform them of our mistake. XXXX XXXX said that their was nothing they could to since it was sent electronically and BofA accepted it. But they assumed BofA would reject it since mortgage closed and provide us a refund check. 

BofA, after being on hold close to 2-hours, immediately informed they are going through a system 's upgrade and it could be up to 10-business days before our payment will be refunded. The payment has yet to be refunded to us or XXXX XXXX. 

We can not access the account on BofA 's website anymore since the mortgage has been paid off. 

We have called at least 6-times and waited each time on hold for at least two hours. When we finally get through the customer care person can do nothing more than take notes and apologize for the delay. We have entered case # 's XXXX and escalation # 's XXXX, but nothing ever happens. We have requested return calls, none have occurred. We have been asked to be forwarded to managers, calls are always disconnected. We have called the local branch and they say they can not assist. 

We need your assistance. It has been three weeks and BofA is refusing to refund a payment of {$5400.00} we made on a mortgage that was paid off."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/2018 I have been paying interest only on my HELOC ( BofA ). ( background information : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. They said the term is up and from my XXXX monthly payments ... it will now go up to {$270.00}. a month. 

I asked for a remodification of the XXXX owed. They sent me paperwork for NOT JUST MY HELOC ... but also for my first mortgage. Which I never asked them to do! 

Now I'm getting phone calls and they hang up on me when I try to respond! I will borrow the {$270.00} they ask for ( due XXXX XXXX, 2018 ) ... but am trying to find an outside loan source in the interim to get RID of this company. 

Are all XXXX XXXX  treated this way by Bank of America??"
Mortgage,"My house is being auctioned on XX/XX/XXXX. I listed my house for sale. My house is in default and I 'm trying to get it sold before foreclosure. We got an offer on my house. My package was originally sent to the servicer on XX/XX/XXXX - it was a full package. We were told it had to be initiated in XXXX. It then was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America has taken a full month to request documents. It is XX/XX/XXXX and up until last week they were still collecting documents. They had taken so long to request things, that they still have not done a full review of my property. My listing agent just got a call today from someone to see the property. It 's unbelievable to me that my lender needs a full two months to review short sale documents and NOT cancel an auction. I 'm requesting a postponement so my file can be appropriately reviewed."
Mortgage,House was built new and purchased in XX/XX/2008 for {$180000.00}. The mortgage was purchased and moved to Bank of America from the original loan company. I refinanced for a lower rate with Bank of america a few years ago. Currently my balance is {$130000.00} and the value is {$200000.00}. The LTV rate is 67.8 % but Bank of America refuses to remove the PMI. Every time I contact them they send me a packet of paperwork showing that I have to pay over {$500.00} for an appraisal before they will remove the PMI. A banker at Bank of America even mentioned that their internal proprietary database shows the home value is {$200000.00}.
Mortgage,I have mentioned over and over again that I do not take calls from Bank of America. At this point I will consider any and all calls and messages as harassment and will begin logging the calls. I am certain Bank of America can email or use traditional mail services as I do not trust Bank of America and with one of the past complaints they epitomized why when claimed a phone conversation occurred which indeed never took place. The only possible reason Bank of America does not wish to email or correspond in writing is out of fear of documenting responses as they most certainly have email in their offices.
Mortgage,"Per the attached Home Affordable Modification Agreement, I'm confused by it's wording. I want to pay off the balance early but when I calculate the amortization schedule it calculates out to a 37 year, 1 month payoff schedule. Per the chart in the attached file named "" Existing Loan Information XXXX '' : The listed "" Contractual Remaining Term '' of 37 Years, 1 Month. The listed Contractual Payoff Date is XX/XX/XXXX so only 17 Years 7 Months from date of XX/XX/XXXX and not 37 years, 1 month. 

In addition, page 2 of the HAMA shows years 1-21 and  total monthly Payments of XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX. I understand and accept there is a deferred principal balance balloon payment of {$21000.00}. I'm disregarding that balloon balance in my calculations but using my current balance of $ XXXX 4.00 % interest and a current P & I payment of {$1200.00} to calculate amortization schedules. 

I need a knowledgeable representative from my current servicer Bank Of America to contact me and explain the amortization to me. I would also like some options in paying it off early."
Mortgage,"The company Bank of America offered me to apply for a new modification program in XX/XX/2012. Which I will receive significant principal reduction and would reduce my monthly payment up to 35 per cent. When I accepted the offer I didn't hear back from Bank of America. However, doing my inquiry about the reduction, I was told it would show up at the end of the loan. When I requested paperwork to show these modification 's. The bank is now saying the modification 's isn't there. I said that l don't understand. Now Bank of America is stating it's to late for the modification. I feel that I have been taken advantage of and wasn't ensure fair treatment. Now all I'm getting is the run-around, costly surprises from by servicers. Bank of America should have told me about my options and given me time to apply and be still considered for loan modifications under the same guidelines and better alternatives. Immediately."
Mortgage,"we had one of the countrywide loans which was an interest only equity loan, at 2 % that originated in XXXX. the bank was Bank of America. around XXXX, my now ex husband and I started divorce procedures. he was refusing to sign off on the loan or be part of a modification. since the bank would n't modify the loan with just me on the more, and refused to accept payment, I was stuck and the loan went 5 years being unpaid until XXXX came around in XXXX. they explained that they were going to forclose on the note and would not offer me any help to modify and or allow me time to sell the house. I had rented the house right before all of this and the BANK OF AMERICA sent a rep to my house and disclosed all of my personal information to my tenant and told him that I had not paid the bank for 5 years without explaining why and My tenant became enraged and said I was lying and DESTROYED my home. he also stopped paying rent for 6 months at {$2000.00} per month which was money I planned to use to pay the bank with hopefully. when I got the house back he had done so much damage as a result of the two visits from the bank, that I could n't sell it. it needed all new carpet, new Windows, new appliances, rock work, new doors and a new garage door. the damage was estimated at {$40000.00} and that was if I did the work myself. 
so going back to when the bank foreclosed. I asked XXXX to send me the deed to the house which they did not have. they did not have our signatures.and the contract they had was fabricated. I have the original documents. they did n't match up at all. they never listed the sale in the paper and they stopped taking my calls. 
then in XXXX they told me to submit a modification application which I did. I was being reviewed and thinking they would work with me until the morning of XXXX when I got a call from tje auction house saying my home was going to be auctioned. and a half hour later that is what they did. 
the house was sold within seconds of being for sale. they took my home with all of the money I had ( OVER {$200000.00} OF EQUITY ) and they sold it and demanded me out. 
not only were they outside of the jurisdiction to even collect on this loan in California ( 4 years max ), they had falsified all of the documents and lied and misled me and were reviewing documents for a modification when they knew they were never going to consider me this is criminal on a giant scale. they are no different then a thief. I am homeless. I have XXXX kids. that equity was all of the money I had and now I have awful credit and a XXXX has left me unable to work in the capacity that I am used to working. 
sometimes I sleep in my car. my kids have to stay with their dad all of the time until I figure out how to deal with this. that kills me. they broke so many laws I ca n't even begin to list them. and it had devastated me and my family. all so that the bank of America could get a measly amount of money to them but a life changing amount for us. and you ask why I did n't fight them? with what money. my savings are gone. I have slept on the beach with my dog. the lawyers all wanted money up front to fight and when I say no one I mean after making hundreds of calls to help me there was not one including any state or federal people that offered. oh I get to tell my story here. it was a cut and dry thing. 
on top of all of this I had explained that I have a XXXX that is life long. my XXXX made it almost impossible to follow through with the procedure to fight them. I was stupid enough to tell them that and they capitalized on it."
Mortgage,"I am a homeowner, and also in Pro Per against XXXX XXXX XXXX, servicer, and Bank of America, beneficiary. I have a straight forward case : approved and a written Trial Plan Agreement was memorialized. When it was memorialized it was sent to their Quality Control Department which sent the documents back to the Loan Mitigation representative to change the payment dates and then mail the documents to me, the homeowner ; he happened to quit that day and the Bank never followed up on the file. I, the owner, followed up by making over 41 calls ; the bank representatives that I talked to on the phone continuously told me my loan was in the Quality Control for review. When I called XX/XX/XXXX ; someone found my file in "" XXXX '' XXXX XXXX Report ; at that time the Bank proceeded to foreclose on my home XX/XX/XXXX. ( The Bank eventually rescinded the title ( XX/XX/XXXX ) back into my name, but never modified the loan. I have continuously lived on my property since XX/XX/XXXX. {$50000.00} later I find myself in Pro Per, because I can not afford anymore legal fees, I represented myself during the three day trial, in which I am not an attorney and did not know the court procedures and was at a grave disadvantage. The Court and the Banks would not allow the case to continue, because there is a "" Five Year Rule '' which I did not know about until I asked for the continuance. 
During discovery I discovered my application was fraudulent as well. There are so many issues regarding my entire case that there needs to be a higher power to look into my case and help me. I filed my complaint with the Independent Foreclosure Audit team and received {$6000.00} ; so there must be some validity to my case. Presently I filed my Objection to the Statement of Decision and Proposed Judgement ; I do not want to lose an opportunity to plead to someone who understands the issues. In the meantime, during Litigation, my loan is sold to XXXX XXXX that does not have a reputation of helping homeowners to obtain a loan modification ; their reputation is in selling the homeowner 's home. 
I want to stay in my home ; I have paid my mortgage payment on time for 22 years, and the year I have a hardship and approved for a loan modification-the Bank failed in their Fiduciary responsibilities.

Mortgage,"My mortgage was initially with Bank of America. In 2007 Bank of America transferred our mortgage to XXXX. In checking my credit report. My mortgage is being reported as XXXX times 90 days late in 2007. Our mortgage was never late!!! We paid Bank of America on time each and every time. They or XXXX is falsely reporting this. Also, it is listed in 2007. When XXXX got the loan they began charging us approximately {$690.00} per month in PMI on a XXXX dollar mortgage. This has to be against the law and unethical at least, price gouging a consumer. I have tried numerous times to get this straightened out with XXXX but never get anywhere. I feel we are being held hostage by this mortgage company who then just in the last two months has transferred our loan again to someone called XXXX. I have asked for our original mortgage documents, they said they would send them but I have not received them. This has been one month ago. I had never seen the late reporting from Bank of America until we went to our credit union to refinance our mortgage because we ca n't afford the payment which continues to go up and is now at {$1900.00} per month because of the PMI. Our loan officer at the credit union could n't understand why my credit score was in the 600 's until she kept looking and found the 90 days late for XXXX times being reported from Bank of America!!!! Help!!! How can I get this removed, it is false and damaging information."
Mortgage,Bank of America denied me with the answer with are NO LONGER reviewing your home loan assitance
Mortgage,"I sent a Qualified Written Request to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, because the servicers informed me that this bank is the trustee of the alleged trust that they say is the owner of the alleged loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX received my QWR on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I sent the letter certified with return receipt. Up to this date I have not received the acknowledge of the receive of my letter as it is required according to Respa, they supposed to acknowledge the letter five days after receiving the letter and then, up to 30 days to answer. Due of the conflicting information and the fabricated copy of the alleged original note from the servicers, I believe, that the alleged trustee can give me the correct information. First, I was told that a XXXX XXXX is the legitimate lender/creditor who provided the funds for my loan on XXXX, this information was disclosed to me at the beginning of this year XXXX. The original lender identified on my trust deed and note, was not the lender, and I was not informed that the XXXX XXXX XXXX investors were providing the funds. Furthermore, I was never informed that the alleged loan was securitized. I checked the records of the alleged securitized loan and found out that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX was dissolved on XX/XX/XXXX due of fraud, in addition this alleged loan was satisfied even before the trust was dissolved by the credit swap insurance. Bank of America has collected payments and inflated fees from me from XXXX up to XXXX, XXXX, then it transferred the service to XXXX XXXX that collected from me from XXXX, XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and transferred the service to XXXX XXXX XXXX, who has been collecting from me since XX/XX/XXXX and current. Since these servicers have failed to proof that they have rights to collect on this alleged, not existent loan, I'm requesting answers from the alleged trustee of a trust that doesn't exist. I want to know if it is part of the scheme, or its name is just been used. For that reason I want a certified copy two sided of the original note and trust deed with all assignments and endorsements. Or otherwise a letter stating that this bank is not the trustee of this non-existent trust."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a response e-mail to XXXX ( Teller ID XXXX ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( see attached documents for the e-mail and the documents attached to the e-mail. ) In this e-mail I advised XXXX that I was in receipt of her letter dated XX/XX/XXXX regarding the available options to me for mortgage relief. 

I informed XXXX that I wanted XXXX XXXX XXXX   to be aware that my mortgage which is under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) was part of a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. With this said, said settlement agreement stated that Bank of America must provide relief to consumers. Some of that relief would be in the form of principal reduction and loan modification that would result in numerous homeowners no longer being underwater on their mortgages and finally having substantial equity in their homes. 

While I was in negotiations with XXXX XXXX XXXX they only thing they offered me was to modify my loan with a lower interest rate and putting all past dues amount, fees, etc. and the principal amount to the end of the loan as a balloon payment. Also, the terms of my loan where not extended they remained with the same end date as the original loan. 

Bank of America/XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX XXXX   have not complied with the Department of Justices Settlement Agreement of XX/XX/XXXX nor have they complied with responding to my first letter to them regarding the consumer relief that is owed to me under the said settlement agreement. They have violated their agreement with the Department of Justice and have failed to provide me with all the allowed relief for my mortgage loan. 

I request that they provide me with answers and with the consumer relief that is due to me under their agreement with the Department of Justice Settlement Agreement of XX/XX/XXXX. The relief is not only a lower interest rate, a loan modification but also principal reduction, forbearance or forgiveness of first lien. Please see in the attached document Page # 5 Consumer Relief for further information on the consumer relief that is to be provided to homeowners.

18 days later I called Bank of America to ask about the status of the refund check and was told that it could take up to 30 days for the check to be released. 

Effectively, Bank of America is borrowing MY money at zero interest. This is clearly wrong ; Bank of America ( and any bank in a similar situation ) should be compelled to refund such an overpayment immediately."

Mortgage,"Our initial purchase was in XX/XX/XXXX, mortgage was through XXXX. As part of that transaction, we chose to pay our insurance directly, only taxes were escrowed. 

Bank of America purchased our mortgage from XXXX shortly after we closed in XX/XX/XXXX. No incidents, all proceeded smoothly until XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX flooded our home. We requested and received a forebearance of six months ( we actually only missed 5 ). We asked whether we needed to pay all back at once, or add five months to end of mortgage. When it became clear that adding five months to end of mortgage was going to require a re-application and perhaps re-negotiation, we said "" no thanks, here is the money we owe you. '' A check for {$8600.00} was sent to them in XX/XX/XXXX. 

At approximately the same time that we were deciding whether to pay back missed payments or to modify the loan, we received a letter reducing our monthly payment by {$10.00} because of overage in escrow. ( Letter date XX/XX/XXXX, to be effective XX/XX/XXXX. ) We continue to pay this monthly amount since the XX/XX/XXXX payment, and have not missed a mortgage payment -- or been late -- since we re-started payments in XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, within days of receiving the decreased monthly payment amount notification, we then received a notification that our monthly payment was increasing by {$500.00} because of the loan modification to include INSURANCE into our escrow account. As stated in paragraph 1 above, we have never paid insurance as part of our escrow, and do not wish to do so. I pay the mortgage from my bank account in an easily manageable amount. My husband pays the insurance monthly due to his long-standing and excellent relationship with XXXX. This works for us. Bank of America contacted our insurance company WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION TO US OR AGREEMENT FROM US and simply changed the account payor to them. We immediately asked XXXX to change it back, which they did, and they refunded the month to Bank of America. 

As stated above, we continue to make payment monthly in the amount given to us by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, {$1600.00}. Bank of America is  holding our payments until enough is received to meet their new modified payment ( {$2200.00} ) which we have never accepted or agreed to. In a call to one of their many service lines on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that we are behind in payments in the amount of {$1100.00}, AND the amount of {$3300.00} is being held by them until we catch up on payments. 

Bank of America continues to inundate us with "" offers '' to modify our mortgage. At least three packages for "" permanent modification of loan '' have been sent to us, which say, "" to accept the terms of this modification, sign and return or simply make payment in the new amount. '' We called and told them we would not be accepting their offer when we repaid the total monthly payments. We are not going to make payment in the new amount. We do not wish to sign and return the modification documents. WE DO NOT WISH TO MODIFY OUR LOAN. 

Along with constant "" offers '' we receive letters advising that we are behind in our mortgage. We also receive letters saying "" please contact us, we want to help you avoid foreclosure. '' A phone call to any of their numerous customer service lines ( which are nothing but phone banks/call centers ) means a half-hour to an hour spent on the phone explaining to someone with no authority what our problem is and what we want. We receive a comment like "" Ah, no problem. I can fix that. '' ( Problem - we do not wish to pay insurance as escrow. Bank of America thinks we want to delete escrow. Person says "" I see, I will clarify that you do not wish to delete escrow but only the insurance portion of escrow. Here is your confirmation number XXXX. '' ) Within 2 days, we receive a letter saying "" Bank of America regrets that it can not comply with your request to delete escrow. '' We have multiple copies of that letter. 

I have just sent a detailed letter to Bank of America with copies of what I believe are the relevant documents. Phone calls to them are a total waste of time, as no one who answers to phone has the authority to cut through the red tape and see a simple problem, and no one who you can get on the phone knows anything about the previous dozens of calls made. I will include my letter to them in the documents I provide to you."

However, my doctor has rendered me totally XXXX, I am trying to find out how to work during COVID and BofA wouldn't qualify me for a loan modification or refinance option due to being on XXXX. Please help, need guidance. XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"We have been dealing with XXXX Bank and Bank of America for more than 4 years trying to work out a loss mitigation settlement on our home. This story is hard to tell without giving some details. We stopped paying our mortgage in XXXX 2011, after seeking the advice of several professionals ( real estate agents, attorneys, and financial advisors ). Our property had lost half of its value, and we were literally throwing money away. We had tried to refinance with our lender for 2 years before we stopped paying. 
After losing my job, we put our house on the market hoping for a short sale. Over 4 years, we had XXXX short sale offers XXXX XXXX, a cash offer for the fair market value of the property ). Every time we had a sale, we would submit the paper work to get approval for the short sale. Every time it was rejected. Recently, we have been trying to get a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, since short sales are no longer happening in our area. Buyers are not willing to put up with the red tape involved with a short sale. 
We feel that we are dealing with a conflict of interest -- -- - Bank of America who owns the mortgage and XXXX Bank servicing the mortgage, and another arm of XXXX servicing our HELOC. We have to work with XXXX Bank regarding all the paperwork, but they tell us that Bank of America 's investors will not give us a deed-in-lieu, but with no explanations as to why. Bank of America was ordered by the courts to resolve these situations with the government settlement they received. 
We had never missed a mortgage payment and had excellent credit, until the housing crash forced us to make some difficult decisions.We did nothing to cause this situation. Our home was supposed to be an investment to supplement our retirement. Now we start retirement with a damaged credit rating and a house we can no longer afford. 
This system is entirely broken. We have spent countless hours filling out paperwork, working with professionals, and doing research. We have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of the banks to deny anything which benefits their customers or the XXXX economy. Our tax money bailed them out, but they are not helping those who were hurt by their reckless behavior. 
Any assistance or advice you might provide would be greatly appreciated. We feel strongly that hearing our story might spur future legislation curtailing the power of the Banking Institutions in this country."

Bank of America continues to refused verbal and written request to close out Deeds of Trust on current XX/XX/XXXX title report. They're attempting a default on our building using these paid off and closed out Deeds of Trust. You should be aware the Office of Comptroller and SEC have also began investigations on this. 

This is a new way for Banks to cover up fraudulent lending practices and bully customers into paying fees and charges under threat and duress. 

We need your help, please. 

Thanks ' in Advance."
Mortgage,"XXXX # XXXX. I have been in contact with Bank of America, and they submitted initial explanation of my original inquiry, however there are still questions. I have reached out twice to the representative, and left two voicemails, however have not heard back. I understand that since it's XXXX XXXX / XXXX week, communication is a little delayed, however I would like to receive a final response on "" other deferred amount '' totaling {$3800.00} pertaining to the Home Modification loan of 2010. My question is, is the deferred amount a fee of the modification loan process, or is this amount corresponding to missed payments? At no time during this time was a payment missed, but rather the payments were purposely withheld by BOA so that I could qualify for the XXXX XXXX loan. Therefore the deferred amount previously mentioned is non-existent. I would like to have clarification on this question. Thank you very much in advance."
Mortgage,In XXXX / XXXX I had trouble making my mortgage payment. I did not have a job and was out of work on a XXXX. I entered into a loan modification program with bank of america in XXXX. The mortgage had not been paid from from XX/XX/XXXX until the modification in XX/XX/XXXX. So it had been twelve months without making a mortgage payment. The mortgage was backed by XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage was transferred / sold to XXXX XXXX. My complaint is that Bank of America performed mortgage fraud. They were paid for the total mortgage amount that I had owed by the insurance company or XXXX XXXX 90 days after I went into default. So Bank of America did not own my mortgage. So that also means that XXXX XXXX has been taking my mortgage payments and is also performing mortgage fraud. Please perform a Forensic Securitization Forensic Mortgage Fraud Audit.
Mortgage,"Over the years since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been trying to resolve the issue of getting behind in payments through loss of income by various methods. My request for loan modification in the earlier years were never approved. Today, Bank of America has  filed a Notice of Default against the HELOC, recorded XX/XX/XXXX. Today I mailed a QWR to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX again. I had sent several QWRs over the years and never received an adequate response. I also have mailed two Rescission Letters and appropriate measures were not taken according to the law regarding the rescission process, therefore the Deeds of Trust and Notes are void.

I have attached the correspondence.

Also, the CA statute of limitations ( CCP 336a ) has passed for any attempts to collect on a note or deed of trust and the alleged servicers continue to attempt to collect an alleged debt, also violating the FDCPA as the alleged debts were never legitimately validated."
Mortgage,"I have a 15 year mortgage with Bank of America taken out in XXXX, now in its last 4 months of payment. I have never missed a payment nor ever paid late. As a matter of fact Bank of America has taken payment automatically from the checking account which I maintain with them on the first of the month with funds being available every time the payment hit the account. 
Around XXXX I noticed on the paper statement that is sent to me, a statement in bold type, that my mortgage account was "" subject to a bankruptcy case or discharge ''. I have never filed or been involved with a bankruptcy. I called several times over the years to try and get this removed. To no avail. The issue of this statement appearing on my statement came into critical focus as a potential problem when another institution which I have applied for home financing asked me to send them a copy of my mortgage statement. I have asked Bank of America to send me a "" clean '' statement, which I have yet to receive."
Mortgage,"I have XXXX mortgage accounts with Bank of America. They are not applying my "" principal only '' payments to the principal balance. All of my "" principal only '' payments are being made after my regular mortgage payment and prior to the next month payment, as I was told to do by a Bank of America representative. XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 I made over 20 "" principal only '' payments and none were applied to the principal balance. I spent over 9 hours during multiple phone calls with representative, supervisors and the managers of supervisors attempting to get this situation resolved. No one could tell me the process to get my "" principal only '' payments accurately posted to the principal balance. They said what I was doing should have worked. They attempted to blame it on a new software program and did not offer me an appropriate solution. I have to work extremely hard to get extra money to make "" principal only '' and it is extremely frustrating when my money is applied to future payments ( principal and interest ). My loan can be paid off early without penalty but Bank of America Home Mortgage has made it difficult to do this. I need to know the process to make sure my "" principal only '' payments are applied appropriately."
Mortgage,"I have a HELOC that expired on XXXX XXXX of this year. Before that I tried to refinance it, but we did not qualify. Immediately after hearing that, I contacted Bank of America to modify it, and that date was XXXX XXXX. I was told I would be contacted within three to five business days. No one contacted me. I made a few calls and was told this gentlemen was in charge and he would call. He called at the end of the month. I immediately submitted all forms needed and he would then set up appointment times, but would not call for those appointments. He would not call at all or call that day at a completely different time. Apparently he could not get in his head that I am in CA and he is in FL and there is a XXXX hour time difference. Anyway, after all of this I also called his supervisor and left messages ( XXXX ) for her, with no return calls. The last time he was supposed to call me he did not, so I called and got someone else. This was the week of XXXX XXXX I believe. She told me that I was denied the modification because they were looking at the interest only payment and not the new payment which would include the principal ... ..in other words, the payment went up from {$280.00} to now $ XXXX. I am XXXX and live with my boyfriend. I can not afford these payments, and they know this. I have now been told to appeal this decision, after a conversation with a very rude person in that department. This is all so totally unacceptable and I feel it should be reported."

Mortgage,"Our loan started out as a revolving credit line, but then matured into a mortgage some years ago, a second trust deed secured by our home. On the date of its maturity, the bank cancelled the associated credit card and precluded any further credit charges. The loan was converted from a credit line into a mortgage as far as usage and loan servicing is concerned. So far, everything as we agreed. 

The problem is that the bank is refusing to change the loan category to a mortgage. With the loan reported in its obsolete pre-maturity form as revolving credit, the credit reporting agencies add the outstanding principal to our credit card debt, artificially inflating our debt-to-income ratio. This is ruining our credit, preventing us from refinancing this mortgage or any other mortgage. According to XXXX, the bank could switch from reporting this as credit card debt to mortgage debt with a simple and quick setting changeWe are requesting that you compel the bank to make that setting change now, and report what has matured into a mortgage as a mortgage. 

Please note that we are not asking any of the data reported about the loan to be changed, only that the bank stop characterizing it as revolving credit so the credit reporting agencies reclassify it with our mortgage where it belongs. As far as the loan itself goes, all payments have been made on time throughout the history of the loan."

Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Master Servicer Bank of America acted intentionally, fraudulently and in conscious and callous disregard for the rights of the borrowers. The damages caused by wrongful foreclosure are tantamount to intentional malice. 
A beneficiary or trustee under a deed of trust who conducts an illegal, fraudulent or willfully oppressive sale of property may be liable to the borrower for wrongful foreclosure. A foreclosure initiated by one with no authority to do so is wrongful for purposes of such an action. 
Master Servicer Bank of America, its assignee or an agent acting on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX instructed Master Servicer Bank of America Home to initiate and complete a  nonjudicial foreclosure sale at the same time borrowers are in a active current workout and making monthly trial modification payments for over a year. The borrowers challenge the wrongful foreclosure and the authority of Master Servicer Bank of America who claims it by assignment. The borrowers wrongful foreclosure claim is based on allegations that the foreclosing party Master Servicer Bank of America acted without authority because the assignment by which it purportedly became beneficiary or trustee, under the deed of trust was not merely voidable but void. 
1 ) Bank of America to put into writing who the true secured lender is? 
2 ) Bank of America to put into writing they foreclosed on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX its assignee or an agent acting on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, gave the authority and instructed the trustee to initiate and complete a nonjudicial foreclosure sale. The borrowers assert Master Servicer Bank of America lacked the authority to foreclose ; because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who invoked the power of sale isnt the true beneficiary. 
Therefore, Master Servicers Bank of Americas inability to follow appropriate foreclosure procedures, have caused them to participate in acts of unfair and deceptive practices including, but not limited to, the following : a ). failing to properly identify the foreclosing party ; b ). charging improper fees related to foreclosures ; c ). preparing, executing, notarizing or presenting false and misleading documents, filing false and misleading documents with courts and government agencies, or otherwise using false or misleading documents as part of the foreclosure process ( including, but not limited to, affidavits, declarations, certifications, substitutions of trustees, and assignments ) ; d ). preparing, executing, or filing affidavits in foreclosure proceedings without personal knowledge of the assertions in the affidavits and without review of any information or documentation to verify the assertions in such affidavits. This practice of repeated false attestation of information in affidavits is popularly known as robosigning. Where third parties engaged in robosigning on behalf of Master Servicer Bank of America, they did so with the knowledge and approval of Master Servicer Bank of America ; e ).  executing and filing affidavits in foreclosure proceedings that were not properly notarized in accordance with applicable state law ; f ). misrepresenting the identity, office, or legal status of the affiant executing foreclosure-related documents ; g ). inappropriately charging servicing, document creation, recordation and other costs and expenses related to foreclosures ; and h ). inappropriately dual-tracking foreclosure and loan modification activities, and failing to communicate with borrowers with respect to foreclosure activities."

Mortgage,"Additional complaint against Bank of America Loan went into forebeafance and then deferment due to covid-19. 

Bank of America called and mailed correspondence specifically stating that payment would resume at same amount post deferment and interest & Escrow would remain in a separate interest free account until Loan is satisfied or home is sold. 

This was reiterated verbally as recently as XX/XX/2020 and prior to that in mail and over the phone. 

Then in XXXX monthly payment was increased {$26.00} a month to re-pay escrow deferment and I was told foreclose and loan delinquencies would occur if extra {$26.00} was not paid for remainder of loan!"
Mortgage,"As I write this I'm still in disbelief over the events of the past year that have led to my home being listed for foreclosure/trustee sale in less than 30 days. A foreclosure would not only be devastating to my family, but it would also impact the families living around me by further dropping property values already suffering from XXXX XXXX levels. 

Below is a timeline of events : XX/XX/XXXX my home loan is current, no late payments since XXXX when I had an accidental over site and the account went 30 days late. Prior to this I had not had a late payment since XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America reaches ( BoA ) out regarding a special disaster forbearance available. The BOA representative said I qualify for the program and I would not need to make mortgage payments for 3 months. He explained the agreement could be extended in 3-month intervals for up to a year and the missed payments would be added to the end of my loan. 

XX/XX/XXXX A BoA representative calls me and said the 3 months of payments need to be paid in full or I could extend an additional 3 months. I explained that I was told the payments would be added to the end of the loan and not need to be repaid all at once. He said they didnt have any options to add payments to the end of the loan at that time, but they were working on additional options which may be available at the end of 3 months. I put repairs to my property from the flood on hold. We have significant damage to our dock, boatlift and bulkhead which was not covered by insurance. 

XX/XX/XXXX BoA representative said I no longer have the option to extend the payments or add payments to the end of the loan. He stated I would need to pay the 6 months of missed payments in a lump sum or apply for a loan modification. He agreed I was initially told the special forbearance could be extended for up to a year but due to a directive from upper management they could no longer extend. He said he would have a manager call me but no one ever did. In the midst of this, I decided to start recording my conversations with BoA when possible. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called BoA and started the modification process. Again, its explained to me this would put the past due amount at the end of the loan XX/XX/XXXX I file a complaint with the CFPB due to the misleading communication by BoA. I was in shock a corporation as large as BoA would deceive their customers experiencing hardship as a result of a disaster. On XX/XX/XXXX, BoA sends a letter regarding my inquiry with the CFPB, stating the forbearance plan notices state any portion of your monthly payments which you are not required to pay during the period will become due and payment upon conclusion of the forbearance plan unless you have reached an agreement with us or other arrangement before that time the letter also stated they could not locate any conversation in the system in which I was informed extensions of additional forbearances would be granted. ( I do have this recorded conversation ) and, of course, I thought the verbal conversations with BoA reps were other arrangements. 

XX/XX/XXXX Receive congratulations notice from BoA that Im approved for a trial modification. Trial monthly payments are {$470.00} higher per month compared to same time the year prior and started XX/XX/XXXX. I was not expecting a payment increase. I told BoA I couldnt afford this payment and didnt understand the calculations. I was told a manager would reach out to help explain. I received a call from XXXX XXXX, a manager with BoA. He called my cell phone and I was unable to record. Mr. XXXX discussed having the modification re-reviewed, specifically escrow shortage figures which appeared to be duplicated. He said I may be able to go back to the initial 30-year term, which would decrease the payment. He said adding the payments to the end of the loan wasnt an option. He advised me not to make the trail modification payments if I couldnt afford them because the perm modification payment would be very similar. He said he would get back to me. I left numerous messages for Mr. XXXX after that conversation and never heard back. 

XX/XX/XXXX I faxed the number on the trail modification letter ( XXXX ) with a letter explaining my conversation with Mr. XXXX as to why I wasnt making the trail payments. I also called BoA and spoke with a representative explaining my conversation with Mr. XXXX. I asked the rep to please have Mr. XXXX call me back. I kept leaving messages with Mr. XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX received a letter from BoA that Im no longer eligible for the modification due to the missed trail payment. The letter stated there were possible options to avoid foreclosure like Short Sale and Deed in Lieu. I contacted my case manager ( XXXX XXXX ) and he directed me to the BoA appeals/audit department to understand the figures and how the trail payments were calculated. The BoA appeals dept said they couldn't help and referred me back to the case manager and then transferred me to Mr. XXXX voice mail again. 

XX/XX/XXXX contacted BoA regarding my options to keep my home. BoA suggested I apply again for a loan modification. On XX/XX/XXXX I started the modification process again, due date for all docs is XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX received notice from BoA that the modification submission complete and in review. XX/XX/XXXX BoA called for additional documents. XX/XX/XXXX received Notice of Trustee Sale from XXXX XXXX XXXX with a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX spoke with BoA and confirmed they have received all needed documents for review of the modification. They said there is nothing I can do at this time to postpone the foreclosure sale date and to "" check back ''. 

I realize how very fortunate I am compared to the devastation others faced due to the hurricane. I truly, truly appreciate anything you can do to help me keep my home."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX I paid off the mortgage with Bank of America so that I could sell the property thru XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Oregon. Several months later I received a cashier 's check dated XX/XX/XXXX for overpayment on the closed account in the amount of {$560.00}. I was told that the check was good for 5 1/2 months. When I took the check into the XXXX, Oregon branch of Bank of America I was told it had been reported as lost or stolen which was impossible as I still had the check which had not been endorsed. Later I was told by the bank manager that the wrong number had been recorded and the bank would send me a replacement check. I have been trying to get my money returned to me. These are the ID # I have been given during this process -- XXXX. During the last ticket # I was told as all of the other calls that check would be sent. I have never received a check. Every time I have dealt with Bank Of America I  have made sure that they had my email address, my new phone number and my new mailing address in XXXX, Oregon. I have faxed a copy of the original check to B O A on XX/XX/XXXX. I have closed all accounts with B O A and bought a new home that is completely paid for in XXXX. Please help me recover my money from from this irresponsible bank."
Mortgage,"Our issue began this year, because of a mortgage default. We attempt on several occasion to rectify with Bank of America. Currently we have experience a lack of communication by our appointed point of contact, and customer retention manager ( CRM ). We have receive notice that we qualify for a short sale, however after only two months of marketing we were informed that our marketing period had ended. We have research and informed the bank that in our current market the time frame to sale is at a minimum of 120 days. We have set varies appointment with the CRM, in which no effort to make contact was made by BOA, neither to us or to the Realtor on file. When we attempt to call the bank the representative who answer tells us that our CRM is not currently available, and attempts to help us with a limited capacity/ while informing us that we would have to make another appointment with the assign CRM. Our Realtor, using the XXXX system has submit, a offer ( cash ) that has been waiting in the equator system, for almost a week. Upon calling Bank of America, they informed us that the offer has not been reviewed, and that current the reviewer is not available. Furthermore that the Customer Retention Managers do not have access to the very system they are should using to help us with the short sale. As a Veteran of XXXX, I expected a little more cooperation. I have repeatedly ask that the property be reevaluated, as the values in our have are on a continuous decline. I am not sure where to turn. I am even willing to complete a deed in lieu, however upon asking the bank, apparently that is not an option. How is that not an option if the foreclosure sale date was already set."
Mortgage,"Reference Complaint Number XXXX. On or about XX/XX/2022, obviously materially altered check # XXXX ( XXXX XXXX Bank of America for payment of Home Equity Line of Credit account number in memo line scrawled over to read XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in the amount of {$4200.00} was cashed with an improper endorsement and deposited into XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America account which leads one to allege a Bank of America employee was a co-conspirator in the theft of funds. XXXX XXXX Bank paid the altered check and sent the {$4200.00} to Bank of America, so XXXX was complicit in this fraud and theft. As soon as my husband and I became aware of the fraudulent theft of the {$4200.00} at approximately XXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/2022, we began calling both XXXX Customer Service, and Bank of America, Customer Service and Mortgage Departments, and filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department. On the morning of XX/XX/2022 my husband spoke to Bank of America and was able to ascertain that XXXX XXXX XXXX had an account at Bank of America he requested that this account be frozen, and our {$4200.00} be restored to us immediately while I went to a XXXX branch to file a Fraud Packet as instructed. Subsequently, we have been made to jump through hoops, to fill out numerous copies of basically the same forms, delver the forms and evidence, etc., and still our stolen money has not been restored. Following this we have been forced to open a new checking account with XXXX, Bank of America froze our line of credit, so we did not have access to the funds for several weeks, and changed our account number : it appears we took a new line of credit and I am not fully confident they removed the late charges. I believe that both Banks are making a concentrated effort to ruin our credit rating while not restoring the {$4200.00} they are complicit in stealing from us."
Mortgage,"Bank of America provided oral instructions by telephone on a recast of my mortgage. I followed the procedure and submitted my letter of intent along with a payment of approximately {$15000.00} to be applied to the principal to complete the recast process and have a lower principal balance on which to calculate my new payment. My check for $ 15,000+ was applied to the principal upon receipt, but I never heard from Bank of America XXXX After repeated phone calls over a one month period, I finally reached someone on the phone who told me that we were denied the recast. There was nothing to be done about the {$15000.00} payment that had been applied to the loan. My payment remains the same. No letter of denial of the recast and no letter of apology for shabby treatment was ever sent to me."
Mortgage,"About 5 years ago our loan was with Bank of America, and it was an adjustable rate mortgage, which the Attorney General of the United States told Bank of America to refinance all unfavorable mortgages ( ie adjustable rate ) but BOA refused to do that for us. Our payments increased and so we tried to get a loan modification but since BOA messed up the payments so bad and refused to refinance the mortgage for us, they sold the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After about 1 year of working with XXXX we were finally granted a loan modification and all the payment issues that BOA messed up XXXX got fixed. Then in XX/XX/2018 we were advised that our loan was going back to BOA as of XX/XX/18. In XXXX we received a letter from BOA stating that we had 60 days to provide proof of homeowners insurance or they would force place insurance on our loan. I reached out to XXXX asking for the name of the CEO or COO names so if I had any problems I had a contact. Well I was given the name of XXXX XXXX at BOA and of course he is in EST and I am in CST so we can never connect and NEVER got the name of the CEO. I went online and found the name of XXXX XXXX who is the CEO and have reached out to him several times and never get a response from him. I have called the 800 numbers they have and asked for the CEO 's name and the COO 's name and are told we don't have that information, they would not even verify an email address stating we don't have that information. I had asked XXXX NOT to return my loan to BOA and was told BOA called them and wanted the loan back. Since then I have had nothing but problems and still trying to fix a problem from XXXX. My homeowners insurance is escrowed along with my property taxes with the modification that XXXX got us approved for to save our home from foreclosure. Back in XX/XX/2018 XXXX paid my homeowners insurance from my escrow account, and when the loan went back to BOA. On XX/XX/18 BOA took {$1000.00} out of my escrow account again to pay my homeowners insurance, when I called them on it, I was told we got an invoice and it was misread and it was paid a second time. I advised that they needed to put that money back into the account as it was not MY error and they needed to take a bank loss for the amount they took out in error. It has taken until XX/XX/18 for them to correct the account supposedly but I have not yet received proof of that money put back into the account via regular mail. In XX/XX/2018 I got a statement stating my mortgage payment was increasing due to a shortage in my escrow account, It has been over 3 weeks since I was told it would be fixed. On XX/XX/18 XXXX XXXX told me they they do not fix problems and take losses like that and then she found out from a XXXX XXXX that it was a bank error and that it was being fixed and that the escrow account would be re-reviewed. I asked for a corrected escrow statement by XX/XX/18 and never received that, and also confirmation that my payments would not be increasing. XX/XX/18 I got a call from XXXX XXXX advising the money was back in my account BUT I needed to call the escrow department and have them review it again. I said no that is not my responsibility as I did not mess up the account that they needed to do that. All the emails I have sent XXXX XXXX I have NEVER received a phone call from him. I even asked for the address of the corporate office and was told that customer service people did not have a physical address so someone could send a written complaint to the CEO. I have spoke with a XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I have asked that since BOA is making mess of this loan that I wanted them to write the loan off and provide me with a paid in full on my account and BOA take a huge bank loss for all the problems I have experienced in the past and present, or they find me a bank to refinance my loan at my current interest rate since we both had to file bankruptcy 2 years ago to save our home. BOA has been nothing but problems and they need to be held accountable. Currently due to BOA error my mortgage payments are going from {$780.00} to {$840.00} to compensate for the error. Not my error and it needs to be fixed by XX/XX/18. I as a consumer should not have to jump through all kinds of hoops to fix a BOA problem. BOA needs to stop messing up and take responsibility. I filed a complaint with the XXXX almost 2 months ago and they have not responded back to the XXXX and I have not heard from the XXXX on the status. BOA keeps calling me and I get upset and hang up the phone as I do not want to listen any longer to the lies they are telling me."
Mortgage,"Five year ago, during my financial struggles, I was found to be deemed eligible for HAMP program through Bank of America. My home loan was modified and I received all of the benefits and protections available to me during that 5 year time period. Customer Service was first class during the 5 year eligibility and no one could touch my account outside of my assigned account manager. Well let 's fast-forward 5 years, my eligibility period has ended, no assigned account manager and ALL protections have ended ... Bank of America attacks like pitbulls. XX/XX/XXXX, I call several times disputing with BOA over PMI that I wanted removed immediately from my account. I received push back. I advised them of my rights as a consumer and threatened to report them, so the removed the PMI reluctantly. In XX/XX/XXXX, I am informed by BOA that my escrow will increase by {$150.00} because of an "" anticipated '' shortfall. I called and email pleading my case. Customer service was horrific and rude! I requested a manager perform a new analysis of my account, because I would NOT be able to handle the increase. I never received the new analysis or a return call. So, I go with the program, I find myself in a state of XXXX thinking, I can't go against this banking bully or giant. XX/XX/XXXX rolls around, I find there to be a {$500.00} dollar overage in my escrow so I email and call requesting my funds be reimbursed. Feeling bullied and threatened, BOA denied my request. I was irate. For 5 years, I was treated like Royalty under the HAMP program, now you are treating me like trash. My mortgage was being paid timely. There was no late payments. I was doing EVERYTHING right, but I the consumer was being treated like a second class citizen. XX/XX/XXXX, I go to make my mortgage payment online. My mortgage has increased by {$55.00}. I was NOT notified! Reviewing my statement online, the have once again INCREASED my escrow amount. Their methods and reasons are unethical, illegal and unfounded. They had just performed an analysis 6 months prior. There was an overage going into XX/XX/XXXX. There should NOT be any PMI on my account. What is the justification for the increase? I was NEVER informed! I paid the requested amount, ONLY to prevent late payments. I am requesting that BOA unethical practices be fully investigated and exposed! I am requesting my overage be reimbursed. I am requesting that the escrow increase be removed from my account dating back to XX/XX/XXXX."

Mortgage,"Hello and Thank you for your help. I am the owner of a mortgage with no collateral ( property ) with Bank of America due to negligence from XXXX XXXX, title company and Bank of America. 
"" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX, XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXXFrom : Atty. XXXX XXXX Set forth below is a synopsis of the bases for my position that the titlle to Unit XXXX is flawed : On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, the then owner of Unit XXXX, Building XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, executed a mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, recorded in XXXX XXXX District Registry of Deeds, Book XXXX, Page XXXX.The mortgage to XXXX was eventually assigned to XXXX XXXX Bank , Trustee.

Legal notices for the sale were published in the XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.Because the assignment of the XXXX mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX not executed until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and not recorded until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX did not have title to the property at the time that it conducted the foreclosure sale and subsequent conveyance of the property. This conclusion is based on the holding of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Trustee vs. XXXX XXXX ( and a consolidated case ) XXXX Mass XXXX, wherein a lender tried to claim title under identical circumstances and the Court ruled that because the assignment of the mortgage to the foreclosing entity had not been recorded prior to the foreclosure sale ( and, specifically, prior to the XXXX publication of notice ) the foreclosing entity did not have good title. 
Accordingly, the foreclosure of Unit XXXX is void and title did not pass to XXXX XXXX XXXX by virtue of the deed recorded in Book XXXX. XXXX XXXX who bought the property from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX."

Mortgage,I sold my house on XX/XX/2014 and paid the money at closing to Bank of America. They went and reported me late to all XXXX credit bureaus thus causing an issue with buying a new home. It still shows up on my new credit report.
Mortgage,"We are residents of North Carolina, and visited Bank of America in XXXX XXXX, NC XX/XX/XXXX to apply for a mortgage. XXXX XXXX researched the property on the BOA system ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NC ), and informed us that because it was a multi-dwelling property that consisted of a main house and XXXX unattached cottages, that the required down payment was XXXX %. It was not possible for us to give a XXXX % down payment, so we did not pursue the mortgage. Earlier this year, we were told by our real estate agent that borrowing rules had changed, so we revisited Bank of America again. We met with XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX BOA branch. We explained our prior meeting with XXXX XXXX and asked if lending rules had changed. As we reviewed and discussed the property on-line together, she informed us that if it was owner occupied the down payment would be XXXX % rather than XXXX %. She pre-qualified us for a 25 year mortgage with a XXXX-XXXX dwelling property for XXXX % down. We proceeded to go through the underwriting process. The bank did the appraisal, we had a survey and inspection done. Over 3 weeks after we applied for the mortgage and spent {$1800.00} on the appraisal, inspection and survey, XXXX XXXX called and said BOA needed an additional XXXX % down on the property due to it being a XXXX-dwelling property. This information was relayed to her SEVERAL times during the process, as well. She knew full well from our initial meeting and after reviewing the property on the BOA system, it 's exact layout, and she knew full well that we could not afford a XXXX % down payment from our initial meeting ( that is why we did n't pursue the loan with XXXX ( her predecessor ). 
My complaints to the bank have fallen on deaf ears with XXXX XXXX 's superior, XXXX XXXX. He stands firm that XXXX XXXX did NOT know the property was a XXXX dwelling property. This is an outright lie, and XXXX XXXX knew exactly what the property consisted of, and what we could afford from our initial meeting. She even said that she would only include the income from "" XXXX of the XXXX cottages '' for us to qualify. We can not proceed with the mortgage and are out {$1800.00} ( {$700.00} appraisal, XXXX, inspection, and {$490.00} survey ) due to XXXX XXXX 's lies and her inability to do her job properly. 
Bank of America refuses to credit us the lost monies ( will not even reimburse us for their appraisal ). BOA employees misled us, and have stolen our money! Had XXXX XXXX done her job properly, we NEVER would have pursued a loan with BOA. I believe they should be required to refund us our lost monies. They have deleted emails from my hard drive ( and have admitted to doing so for security purposes after a certain amount time ). The only back up I have is the pre-qualification letter stating that it is a XXXX-XXXX property dwelling requiring a XXXX % down payment. One can see on-line in the public arena the EXACT layout of the property, and it was exactly such on the system the BOA uses which was shown to me at my initial meeting with XXXX XXXX. We are hardworking individuals with a 30 year banking relationship with Bank of America and have been treated unfairly. That money is ours, and should be refunded due to their incompetence. I see that BOA has had XXXX mortgage complaints since XX/XX/XXXX. They are thieves, and I believe they are running a scam, as many complaints against them are the same as ours. They mislead folks, then ask for a higher down payment, or say they can not find comps, and then will not refund their appraisal fee. We are entitled to compensation due to their inability to properly do their job. My complaint has fallen on deaf ears, and they say ( after deleting my emails ) that I have nothing in writing to defend my complaint! XXXX XXXX 's superior is XXXX XXXX."
Mortgage,"Bank of America, through their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), has or will cause to be recorded a Trustee 's Deed upon the sale of their XXXX interest held by the XXXX Deed of Trust to a third party. 

As dual tracking is prohibited, Bank of America and XXXX have no authority to record the Trustee 's Deed based on the unlawful recording of the Notice of Default ( NOD ) and the subsequent Notice of Trustee Sale ( NTS ). 

This property has been held by me under a claim of adverse possession upon meeting all requirements of law. Therefore, my property and home are not subject to foreclosure or Trustee Sale and no NOD or Trustee 's Deed should have been reorded. 

It should be noted Bank of America has made no default claim on the XXXX Modified Deed of Trust to date. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX the agent of the XXXX ( XXXX ) came out to my home and could see the published and posted Notice of Ownership through Adverse Possession which establishes the fact the XXXX may no longer claim lack of knowledge of my ownership of the property through adverse possession. Although not required, the Adverse Possession Declaration is still posted on the property to date and will remain until a court order is issued to remove the notice from my property. Additionally, upon being told they would have to put me out of my home, the XXXX agent replied, "" We 're not trying to put you out. '' An indication there are no plans or intention to reside upon the property. 

All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and mandatory to include all fees and charges included under the XXXX Making Home Affordable ( MHA ) Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) Modified Deed of Trust including, but not limited to the charges related to the XXXX XXXX Deed of Trust."
Mortgage,"It all started in XXXX when I made my house payment to Bank of America on the XXXX, and it cleared my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. They mistakenly applied the entire amount, ( including {$100.00} extra to principal, which I do every month ) to principal instead of house payment, Who in their right mind would make a {$1200.00} payment to principal and not make their house payment. I have tried the entire month of XXXX and XXXX to clear this up. I ended up making my XXXX payment over the phone, and getting a confirmation number because the local branch where I usually make the payment wouldn't accept it. I made that payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and it cleared my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I recently made my XXXX payment over the phone as well, and got a confirmation number because B of A keeps sending me letters saying that I owe {$2700.00}. Every time I speak with someone it is a minimum of an hour and a half on the phone, and they always tell me that it shows I have made my payments, but due to their error, they are not being processed correctly. I spoke with someone again this morning and told them they have until next Wednesday to clear this up or I would be contacting you."
Mortgage,"My mortgage account was paid off, and I expected refund of the escrow balance + unused interest. The bank did not send the final statement and cut off my online access. Luckily, I kept the web records, and calculated that they quietly reduced the refund. When questioned on the phone, they reluctantly admitted that they charged different fees. No such fees were expected, disclosed or authorized by me. I specifically asked the new lender, who received the payoff requirement, and have the emails explaining that only the interest was the factor and would be prorated based on actual payoff date. The bank representatives were putting me on hold and could not come up with the straight story about the fees. On XXXX XXXX, however, with my persistence, they agreed that there was {$130.00} added and promised to send a check for {$60.00} stating that remaining {$75.00} they could not refund : Supposedly, it was a recording fee to my county. My new lender had all the settlement fees disclosed, and everything was covered by the new loan. I think that they are hoping that I give up. It is very difficult to reach someone using the customer service number they provide, they do not direct you to a helpful department without much pain, use long holds and make promises like sending a statement or making a case that would be acted upon that they never plan on executing - one manager even admitted that."
Mortgage,"BoA, after collecting {$680.00} for a credit check and appraisal, was unable to get underwriting approval for my refinance because my home is subject to a leasehold, aka ground rent. In XXXX, ground rent is public knowledge and is available online via a simple address lookup from the Land Records Office ( XXXX ) and Dept. of Assessments and Taxation ( XXXX ). Furthermore, I chose a loan officer in XXXX to avoid issues like this - ground rent is common in a few states that I know of : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. If BoA knows it can not close a loan on a property subject to a ground rent, then it should not accept money or string customers along. In this case, I applied XX/XX/XXXX and on that date, paid for the appraisal ( {$670.00} ) and credit report ( {$15.00} ) and was denied at the end of XX/XX/XXXX! XXXX help me if this cash out refinance was to help with medial bills or school and not home improvements - I would be XXXX feet deep or a drop out because of the negligence and possible fraud committed by BoA. I have contacted BoA regarding a refund for the appraisal and credit report several times via my contacts on this loan ( Retail Sales Manager, XXXX XXXX ; Mortgage Loan Coordinator, XXXX XXXX ; and Home Services Specialist XXXX, XXXX XXXX ). I have n't even begun to calculate damages for stringing me along for XXXX months. 

I was extremely disheartened yesterday when I learned that a fellow XXXX resident had the same thing happen to him. I have encouraged him to file a complaint as well. The bottom line is that BoA is unfit to do mortgages in XXXX. Plain and simple, no questions asked. We have XXXX cases of extreme negligence bordering on fraud. Cut BoA off from these deceitful practices in my state!!! 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"If have been trying to get a loan modification for nearly a year. I have been getting the run around and I have been lied to on several occassions. I have applied for previous loan mods at least 3 -4 times over the past 3 years. I applied when I made more money but was not eligible for a loan mod and got turned down. I applied again when I made less and was still turned down. I appears to me that they are unwilling to help me. Since the most recent attempt to get a loan mod I have been told that documents were not received when I had confirmation that they were delivered via fax. I was sent notices to a database when I never set up to receive documents or communication that way. I was supposely sent documents from the lender but did n't discover it until I called for follow up. Had I not followed I would have missed significant deadlines that would have disqualified me entirely. I was promised that the point of contact would check in with me on a regular basis and that did not happen, I was asked to send more documents when I had already sent them. All of this confusion with the mortgage company took more time to than it should have and in the process my job ended. ( So now I am not approved for a loan mod nor eligible to refinance. ) I am in a Option Arm loan with an interest only payment option which will be done away with and this will subsequently make my monthly payments unaffordable as I used the interest option because it was most affordable. It is my belief that Bank of America has never had any intention to help me keep my home. A loan modification would help me avoid a catastropy of potentially losing my home of 17 years. <P/>My last loan modification attempt was denied in XXXX 2017. A letter was sent on XXXX XXXX 2017 appealing their decision and requested a reason for the denial because it was ambiguous and nothing was received from the lender. I called yesterday and today and finally got through and was told that today was my deadline to appeal the decision. Imagine if I had n't followed up again what would happen? I believe the lender is trying to set me up for failure. I can not refinance my house due to my employment status. I am seeking assistance in making my home affordable. <P/>The name of my lender is Bank of America. My loan number is # XXXX. My point of contact is XXXX XXXX, Home LoanTeam Point of Contact. XXXX XXXX, Resolution Specialist in the Executive Mortage Servicing Compalints Unit."
Mortgage,Bank of America sold my loan to XXXX and never notified us. I found out when I tried to pay my mortgage and now XXXX will not let us make a payment until XXXX XXXX. We need to pay it now because we 're closing on the XXXX of XXXX on another property and all the paperwork is reflective of the payoff amount minus the last payment.
Mortgage,"We were in trail modification payments with Bank of America XXXX ( XXXX ) times and they never gave us a final modification. We paid over {$30000.00} in trial payments to Bank of America.

Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I got an FHA loan for a home in XXXX XXXX Missouri with my wife. We were both low income and were able to make the payments, until the market downturn. In early XX/XX/XXXX I enlisted in the military due to not being able to make ends meet even after working 2 jobs and my wife working. We tried to sell the house, from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, but there were a number of foreclosures on our street and this was after the housing bubble burst. We applied with Bank of America, the mortgage servicer, for loan modification, short-sale, and deed in lieu, but was denied at every turn. After I went into the XXXX, we decided to let the house go into foreclosure. AS it turns out, Bank of America found out I joined the military and stopped the foreclosure process. We communicated with Bank of America for years, we told them we would sign off on any waiver needed to allow them to follow through with the foreclosure. We were told by Bank of America that it was not our decision to make. Finally, in XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America finally filed suit in XXXX XXXX, MO county court to get a default judgment against us in order to foreclose. At that time, I put a complaint into the Missouri State Attorney General for unethical business practices for holding the foreclosure for 6 years. Bank of America returned with a statement saying that they did nothing wrong, the lengthy time was due to court proceedings, however, they could produce no evidence that they had filed anything with the court prior to XX/XX/XXXX. While this was going on, they decided to let us try a short-sale. I spoke with the short sale specialists there and was under a program where loans that were in delinquent status were offered a short sale and they would also pay the consumer {$10000.00} if a short sale is closed. At the same time, they also had a lawyer working on getting a default judgement though the court. In XX/XX/XXXX, we received a short sale offer on the house. We started the process of the short sale. Two weeks ago, I received news that everything had been put on hold due to the fact that Bank of America has decided to sell our Mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Just before finding out that our loan had been sold, we were also given a consent judgement from XXXX XXXX county court. So the short sale was going through, and the foreclosure was finally moving forward, then they decide to sell my mortgage to a predatory lender. I believe that Bank of America has acted in bad faith toward me and my family and I do n't know if any laws were broken, but they have definitely acted unethically toward a now XXXX veteran  who served his country for over 6 years. I would like Bank of America to pull the mortgage back from the sale and follow through with the short sale or foreclosure.

Previous inquiries ( 3x last being XX/XX/XXXX ) indicated that the loan is held by the original lender yet the lawsuit ( filed XX/XX/XXXX ) reflects the owner XXXX XXXX. 

So I agreed to a stipulation under much time pressure to consent to judgment in exchange for more time to seek financing or sale of the house. That very day after consent was made, a proposed judgment amount came in and was not in line with what I envisioned. Moreover the co owner of the property came to the realization she did not retain the attorney I had used to make this deal. So I filed a XXXX XXXX to see if the bankruptcy court can help arrange a payment plan that takes into account the long and tortured history of this loan and any statue of limtations that can deduct amounts or arrange the debt to make it affordable."
Mortgage,"My forbearance began in XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX was Informed by Bank of America XXXXhat I had three possible options, repayment plan, modification, or deferment of payments to the end of the loan. I was later told I did not qualify for deferment since I had a missed payment. After evaluation, it was determined that repayment would not be an option because the payments would be too high. The best option would be to apply for a modification. I completed my initial application for assistance in XX/XX/XXXX and provided the requested documents. In XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America had questions about bank statements that were submitted. I provided letters of explanation. 
My initial paystubs were deposited in my daughter 's checking account-provided letter of explanation to Bank of America XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX was informed that the letter was not satisfactory-BOA was requesting my daughter 's bank statement. My daughter did not want to share the information .BOA would accept letter from my daughter 's bank verifying account. The bank did prepare that letter for BOA. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that the information was not sufficient and assets could not be verified. I have resubmitted a request for mortgage assistance -my paystubs are now deposited into my account. I received a letter from BOA that assets could not be verified. I spoke to BOA and was asked to re-submit the application. I re-submitted the application and again received the same response. Bank of America has received all updated documentation but is sending the same response."
Mortgage,"I filed a complain previously about this : I purchased a home in XX/XX/2018 through the XXXX  home buying program. I went through all the appointments and classes to make sure that I was ready to purchase a home and that I knew my affordable mortgage amount due. I closed on XX/XX/2018. I was told my mortgage amount would be {$1100.00}. A year alter, I was told by my Mortgage company that my new payment amount would be {$1300.00}. When I closed on the home, the title company told me that I was issued a credit because the sellers paid the property taxes for the home up until the day of closing. A year later, come to find out, they did NOT. Bank of America paid the difference and assessed it onto my mortgage. 

They followed up with a BOGUS call back number. I have called the number 15 times, left numerous voicemails, and can't get a call back. 
They are croooks!"
Mortgage,"Bank of America refused XXXX mortgage payments from me & returned them all to my personal account stating the amounts were incorrect with no further explanation. They refuse to reaffirm my mortgage after Bankruptcy and I 've been making payments until I lost my job in XXXX 2015. I pay homeowners insurance and property taxes via escrow, yet I 'm being treated like a renter. I applied for modification during my job loss & have made several attempts to make payments. Bank of America took payments in XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX and has refused all others. I have been assigned to XXXX different account reps within a very short period of time & no one has any answers regarding my payments being rejected."
Mortgage,"This is a complaint about the CFPB process. I submitted a claim against Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX, and was told I would receive a status update in 15 days. 
On the XXXX day, the "" status update '' was that it would now be 60 days to hear anything back. 
Having talked to CFPB personnel by phone, I was told that companies are allowed to request up to 60 days time once the XXXX day has been reached. 
Did Bank of America request more time? What was the decision process to grant them more time? Is there any evidence they did anything on this complaint in the first 15 days?"
Mortgage,"I was in process of completing a loan for the purchase of my first home with XXXX. I went into where I had my current checking account at Bank if America here in XXXX XXXX. When I went to send the wire the banker stated they would not charge me for the wire if I spoke with their mortgage banker to review their offer. I then sat with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He then described how if I wrote an email to him stating I had a certain rate and points from XXXX he would be able to match that quote. He then proceeded to write the verbiage I needed to say. He told me to copy paste what he wrote and sign it for him. The rate he gave me initially was at a 1 point cost. He said with this letter he could waive that point cost. I later found out that due to the type of loan program and amount I was putting down that Bank of America didnt even truly offer that product for my situation. I felt very uncomfortable, almost like I was committing fraud. I called my mortgage banker and explained how I felt. I realized I wanted to write this report to explain how I felt and did my own research realizing that the process of XXXX writing the letter for me and using an letter to quote match is not actually the correct process to complete a quote match."
Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX, we respectfully filed a complaint with the Florida Attorney General against Bank of America for failure to abide by a stipulated agreement on XX/XX/XXXX. In exchange for a loan modification, BOA demanded that we sign a consent to judgment. What happened next will blow anyones mind. After the consent was signed, BOA failed to provide a loan modification and instead transferred the loan to fraudulent Rushmore which they tried to sale our home a few times while ignoring many mortgage assistance request. BOA entered into a consent to judgment in all 52 states including Florida for Unfair Business dealings in regards to loan modifications. BOA failed to abide by its own consent to judgment with the United Sates of America in connection with our loan. The last correspondence from BOA they indicated to have a resolution by XX/XX/XXXX. As of today XXXX XXXX, BOA not only failed to provide a resolution but also failed to answer the complaint to the Attorney General. Sanctions should would be appropriate at this juncture."

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) acquired the XXXX Mortgage loan from CWF after obtaining approval from CWF for a Subordination of the HELOC in XXXX XXXX. Complainants commence this complaint alleging fraud, fraudulent inducement, breach of promise & violations of General Business Law ( "" GBL '' ) XXXX, known as the Deceptive Practices Act against CWF-BA & XXXX. In addition to compensatory and punitive damages, complainants seek a declaration that the Subordination agreement signed in XXXX XXXX by CWF & XXXX on behalf of complainants is null & void, and to enjoin the enforcement of the notes & mortgages as unenforceable against complainants. 
-In XXXX XXXX, the US Dept of Justice ( USDOJ ) announced a {$330.00} XXXX ( M ) settlement with BA over discriminatory lending practice at CWF XXXX USDOJ also found that BA discriminated against qualified XXXX & XXXX borrowers from XXXX to XXXX - minority borrowers who qualified for prime loans were steered into higher-interest-rate subprime loans. Further, the USDOJ in XXXX XXXX reached a {$16.00} XXXX ( B ) settlement with BA to resolve Federal & State claims against BA & its former & current subsidiaries, including CWF & Merrill Lynch. As part of this global resolution, BA agreed to pay a $ XXXX penalty under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery & Enforcement Act ( FIRREA ) and provide XXXX of dollars of relief to struggling homeowners, including funds that will help defray tax liability as a result of mortgage modification, forbearance or forgiveness. The settlement does not release individuals from civil charges, nor does it absolve BA, its current or former subsidiaries & affiliates or any individuals from potential criminal prosecution. 
-Notwithstanding, In XXXX.

6. PA statue of limitations due apply, if this assignment have any merit. 

MERS and Bank of America continue to deny me information referencing these outdated liens/ assignments that are not present on my property deed nor credit report."
Mortgage,"To Whom It May Concern : I am XXXX XXXX, and I have been attempting to obtain the Lien Release Statement and/or the Grant Deed in Perpetuity for my home, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX # XXXX, from Bank of America XXXX and only after a very long and arduous process of first having to determine ( and then overcome ) the true facts and chain of events regarding the true ownership of the property in question, due ultimately to a very severe and fairly sophisticated case of Identity Theft, unfortunately involving myself, my identity, and said property, among many other issues, fraudulent actions, and scenarios. 

My ex-partner, XXXX XXXX, now deceased, in cooperation with the I.D . Thieves themselves, deliberately attempted to obscure the true chain of events surrounding this property, including the fraudulent taking my 50 % ownership interest in the property from me, XXXX XXXX, with XXXX himself actually being recruited to join the I.D . Thieves cause, directly attendant upon our joint purchase of the property in question in XXXX, and which XXXX did whole-heartedly and enthusiastically, if not with much innate natural proficiency, luckily for me! 

The perpetration of this I.D . Theft involved several individuals actually, who fraudulently took my home from me in XXXX, under what was purportedly a foreclosure of the property for our failure to consistently pay our Bank of America Mortgage. The mortgage was in actuality moved by these persons at this time from the mortgager I was familiar with, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to Bank of America ( at the time XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) without my knowledge or consent, where it remained for only a very short time until it was eventually paid off quite early. 

And even this early payoff would be effectuated with monies also stolen from me and intended as compensation for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I suffered for my XXXX XXXX, and as the result of a medical malpractice class action lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX, in which I was entered as an unwitting participant. I was totally unaware of said lawsuit, the information of which was very effectively kept from me, again by my loving partner at the time, XXXX XXXX. ( I tell you, I wish I had XXXX more, just like him! ) This early payoff was essentially done in efforts to resolve the probable beginnings of a threatened foreclosure of the property, perhaps indeed initiated by XXXX deliberate failure to pay the mortgage while I was forcibly away from the property for a Court-ordered XXXX  Evaluation XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which lasted for 78 days ), before I was eventually successfully able to return home, although it was a very close call as to whether I would be able to return from this Evaluation ( and XXXX  ) at all! Interestingly, it was clearly obvious by the perpetrators reactions to my triumphant return home that I was never actually expected to have been able to have done so! 

Thank Goodness this was the case, too, as I was supposedly facing over a two-year prison sentence, a fact which I was totally unaware of at the time, having actually been arrested for actions my I.D . Thieves had themselves perpetrated, albeit under my name and identity! In fact, to date I have now been arrested a total of fifty-one times, which totally destroyed my existing employment at the time, which was working for a local government public employer, as well as my ability to probably ever utilize my XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX for any future employment possibilities as well. Although, as I am very fond of telling anyone who will listen : If XXXX out on the streets after fifty-one arrests, theres something wrong with me, something wrong with the XXXX, or something else is going on here! 

The I.D . Thieves were also able to steal my entire accumulated XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, too, with which they then successfully retired early as me, XXXX XXXX, an income they were receiving for about XXXX years before I was able to comprehensively explain the nature of the fraud to XXXX, which ended said income to these people, although I have not yet been able to address and rectify the situation with XXXX, ultimately to begin receiving my rightful income from said public service career, of about 15 years, all told. ( And I remember thinking at the time that the XXXX Pandemic could not have come at a worse time than it had for anyone as it had for me, shutting down all public departments, agencies, and entities as it did, for a further XXXX years or so! ) But, back to the property in question, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  The first, or original, mortgage loan number for this property, as assigned to it under B of A when the loan was first taken over by Countrywide XXXX XXXX, and which was, in actuality, a simple refinance of a pre-existing mortgage from a prior lender, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is lost to history, and apparently as a result of the mandatory keeping of records for such loans being only XXXX to 10 years. This is an understandable, if regrettable, aspect of this particular case. That primary, or first, mortgage was definitely paid off early, however, resolving the budding, and purposeful, foreclosure proceedings on the property, once and for all. 

That loan was, however, as I have said, paid off in full, but not before another, though apparently intended as only a temporary, loan number was also assigned to the property, this as a result of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, under which we qualified for mortgage loan modification measures and directly as a result of said XXXX. XXXX and I were each given a substantial reduction to the existing outstanding mortgage balance we owed to Countrywide at the time as a result, which no doubt greatly facilitated XXXX in the early payoff of the home as well! The proof of this mortgage debt reduction can be seen in the form of XXXX IRS XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX and XXXX respectively, denoting said XXXX of XXXX. That temporary loan number is XXXX, and is XXXX of XXXX loan numbers still active in regard to this particular property, if only erroneously, as I will now attempt to further explain. 

In fact, it was paperwork regarding the XXXX XXXX XXXX  Crisis which came to me at my newly acquired apartment after having left the house, XXXX, and our relationship, which first apprised me that Bank of America was somehow involved at all, as the enclosed paperwork stated we, had had a loan serviced by Bank of America, a company I truly despise! ( And this is no doubt the reason the I.D . Thieves and XXXX chose B of A to take out the fraudulent refinancing of the existing mortgage. ) After clandestinely moving the existing mortgage from XXXX  XXXX to Bank of America, XXXX then immediately complicated the issue further, and deliberately so in my opinion, by causing yet an additional and third loan number to be created against the same property while this temporary and second loan number was in place for the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Crisis. XXXX, by some mysterious manner unknown to me, was able to take out a {$15000.00} H.E.L.O.C. Loan against the property, without my knowledge and certainly without my consent, under that temporary loan number, XXXX # XXXX. ( Interestingly, this action was also accomplished at the same local XXXX, CA XXXX of B of A which had also entertained XXXX and my I.D . Thieves on other occasions, such as the original fraudulent refinancing of the property. This third loan number, generated for purposes of this {$15000.00} XXXX Loan alone, is Loan # XXXX, and is represented by Document # XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, and recorded on XX/XX/XXXX, by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

It is interesting to note, however, that this document is no longer to be found, nor have I ever been able to find it, currently or otherwise, in said XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, despite the ostentatiously obvious Recorders Stamp to be seen on the document and done again, as I suspect, in obvious collusionary efforts at obscuring the true ownership records for the property, and most especially from me, XXXX XXXX. 

Interestingly, although my name does apparently appear on the Trust Deed documentation for said additional H.E.L.O.C., Loan # XXXX, I am just as definitely not a co-signer on the associated Promissory Note for the same loan, and I was definitely not present at the creation of this additional H.E.L.O.C. against the property. Additionally, these Promissory Note documents are not typically recorded along with other loan documentation for financial vehicles such as represented by this fraudulent H.E.L.O.C., thus making it very difficult to locate and obtain any of the loan documentation for this property and its associated loans, as B of A will not release any loan information to persons not also listed on any associated loans Promissory Note, regardless of the names which XXXX, or XXXX not, appear on the other loan documentation or ownership documents for that same loan or other associated mortgages, as is the deliberate case here, and specifically in regard to me, XXXX XXXX. ( Nevertheless, I include said documentation, sans the Promissory Note, for the loan in question, saying only that a business or company is only as good as that representative one gets in person or over the phone, and that some B of A Employees are more assiduous in observing their companys protocols than others. ) The last and final document which I feel is relevant to the resolution of this situation, and also received only as a result of those most recent of my ongoing phone calls to B of A, is Document # XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, and recorded on XX/XX/XXXX, and which is, of course, a Substitution of Trustee and Full Reconveyance which would seem to pay off the erroneously remaining XXXX. Loan encumbrance on the property, and thereby will hopefully enable the issuance of the long-awaited and anticipated XXXX XXXX XXXX which is itself apparently currently impeded by an erroneous foreclosure hold code preventing that specific action, and which I hope assistance from the XXXX will help address and overcome. 

Thank you for your attention to this, admittedly bizarre, matter. I append with this Cover Letter to the XXXX those documents and correspondence I think relevant to the situation and its hoped-for resolution, which I have found and/or previously composed and sent to B of A in my personal efforts to resolve this issue, having failed for some reason or technicality to XXXX the assistance of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to whom I recently applied for assistance with this matter, which subsequently declined to take my issue and case, but nonetheless did refer me via written response to your agency as perhaps the best such entity to help me resolve this absurd and altogether far too lengthy an issue with Bank of America. Let us hope this is the case, as I am about at my wits end in dealing with Bank of America and its sprawling network of possibly-involved Units, XXXX, and Persons! 

Sincerely, I am, XXXX XXXX"

I told them I want to buy a house in XXXX county MD and specifically in Zip Code XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. They told me they will not give me a loan to buy in those zip codes. They said that they will give me a loan if I buy in certain zip codes only. We have excellent credit score, have assets more than the loan amount. The reason they don't want us to buy in those zip codes is that they said my wife have only one line of credit even she have more than 700 credit score which is excellent. For me I look it like this. Most poor people don't have more than one credit card ( line of of credit ) and they want those people to buy only in certain zip codes may be they don't want them to live in good neighborhood. The loan office is : XXXX XXXX. e-mail : XXXX Phone : XXXX His manager is XXXX XXXX e-mail : XXXX Phone XXXX. I talked to the manger and and he told me the same reason. Also the manger told me that even we have good income, good credit score and enough asset for down payment and so on, we are still risk borrower. We are XXXX XXXX and we emigrated to this country and we suspect that is the reason they don't want to loan to us.

Based on discussion with a XXXX  Loans representative, the payoff was made with a wire transfer on XXXX/XXXX/20, which was the agreed upon disbursement date on my Closing Disclosure. Bank of America claims they did not receive payoff funds until XX/XX/XXXX and charged me 7 days of interest ( {$460.00} ) instead of 4 days ( {$260.00} ) as I expected, based off daily interest of {$66.00}. Bank of America also did not provide confirmation that my loan was paid off with a final statement or otherwise until I specifically contacted them to request the transaction history.

Mortgage,"Bank of America is refusing to modify my HELOC on my primary principal residence.

Bank of America states I don't qualify for a loan modification. I have made numerous attempts to apply for a loan modification and have been denied.

I recently in the last two months modified my 1st Mortgage with XXXX XXXX with no problems. XXXX XXXX modified my loan in less than 20 days with no hassles. Bank of America is not making any attempt to help me stay in my home. It is frustrating to get the run around with Bank of America when applying for a Loan Modification."
Mortgage,"After an initial denial of a modification request based upon a job loss resulting in an income decrease of XXXX figures, Bank of America sent us a "" settlement offer '' which stated unconditionally that our second mortgage of XXXX would be reduced in principle to XXXX, with resulting payments, etc, and not to accrue interest. The letter stated that it was a "" settlement in full ''. There were no conditions mentioned, nor any restrictions. We contacted our "" recovery analyst '' with a few questions. Would there be any pre-payment penalty? No. Were there any conditions on the settlement, including conditions on the sale of the home? No. After making these payments for 8 months, we decided that since were were no longer under water, to get a better handle on our finances we needed to sell and move into a rental home. Nearing the close of escrow, after a request from the escrow agent, B of A stated that the payoff balance was XXXX! The original XXXX, less the payments we had made since the "" settlement in full ''!! They have told us that the payoff can not be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the home. This is the XXXX time this was ever told us. We spent thousands on repairs and inspections. We will now fall out of escrow. After being lied to ( It 's the law '' they told my husband. I, an attorney called back and stated I wanted the Code section on which they relied, then they stated it was probably an internal rule ). They consider this a short sale now. My request ( which would be for them to accept the XXXX, XXXX without regard to the origin of the funds, so we can sell our home, but I know this is not realistic ) is to provide better communication and information. Also, B of A has a "" notice '' problem. This condition was never stated in writing, nor orally. They MUST be required to publish this information. It is a critical condition and materially affects the terms of the "" full settlement '' which is not really a full settlement, more like a conditional forbearance. They have a legal problem with this, and when they get someone who has the time and patience, they will be facing another class action. What I really want now is to let our first foreclose, and let B of A get 100 % of NOTHING."

Mortgage,"Regarding equity loan with bank of America that required balloon payment in XXXX 2015. I requested extension or modification of this loan in early XXXX to avoid any potential negative effect on my loan. Bank did not approve loan modification until XXXX. During the approval period, I continued to make all payments on time and in the amount due or more. Upon approval I was notified of a three month "" trial '' period for some unknown reason before loan would be finalized. During this "" trial '' period I could only make payments in the amount due even though I offered to pay more, even an amount to the total of the three month period to expedite the approval period. The bank would NOT allow such a payment plan, only the amount due each month. Even though my loan was approved, the bank then submitted a delinquent notice to the credit agencies. In turn my credit rating quickly dropped from XXXX XXXX very good XXXX to XXXX XXXX fair ). I have responded to all bank requirements regarding this loan in order to avoid any negative credit reporting. The bank did not advise me that upon loan extension approval that I would be reported as delinquent. The bank misrepresented the consequence of the loan extension and unfairly and unjustly damaged my credit rating. I feel that consumers need to be protected against such improper banking practices. Full transparency must be a requirement. I request that the Bank of America be required to fully disclose their delinquent and unfair handling of my account so that I can restore my very good credit rating."

Mortgage,"SInce XX/XX/XXXX we have been working on getting put into review for loss mitigation. This is our second time filing a complaint as nothing was resolved the first time. We filed the first complain ont XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America only followed up twice on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX and took a month to get an answer after that and the answer was still no. The reason we are being denied getting put into review for XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America wants the borrower 's son who is listed as a co-borrower to sign some documents. Here is where lies the root of the problem as the borrower 's son filed a quitclaim deed on XX/XX/XXXX right after filing bankruptcy to dissolve any personal responsibility from loan and dissapeared. The borrower has not been able to get in touch with her son as she has no idea where he is. Yet, Bank of America persists that they will not go through a review for loss mitigation unless the son is able to sign certain loss mitigation documents."
Mortgage,"The responses offered did not fit my situation. The ones I chose were closest to it. 

I recently received my XXXX mortgage interest form from Bank of America. It was not correct. My XX/XX/XXXX mortgage statement stated that I paid {$22000.00} in interest. My XXXX, which was available online on XX/XX/XXXX, stated the amount was {$20000.00}. I called during the 1st half of XXXX and was told by the person that they would send a revised form. As of XX/XX/XXXX I had not received the form so I called again to find out the status. The phone system says a new form was sent XX/XX/XXXX ( it wasn't posted online and I didn't receive a copy in the mail ). When I reached a person ( XXXX employee # XXXX ) she explained that since I have prepaid 4 months of my mortgage, they would only report interest through the scheduled XX/XX/XXXX payment ( which was made in XXXX ). I mentioned that the Table 1 Instructions for IRS publication 936 ( page 10 ) states that "" You can deduct all of the interest you paid during the year on mortgages ''. When I asked to speak with someone that could answer why BofA was interpreting mortgage interest this way she would not forward me to anyone else. She said that both the Tax Area and Year End Department were closed for the day ( this  was at XXXX in the XXXX  EST )."
Mortgage,"Bank of America accepted mortgage payments from me, giving me a confirmation number for the payments, then, failing to apply them to my loan, they have attempted to return them to me. They are trying to foreclose on me, saying that I defaulted on my loan, when they have both failed to apply payments and failed to accept payments, erroneously claiming I had defaulted on my loan. They are now trying to foreclose on me by a "" Summary Judgment Motion, '' suggesting their claim that I defaulted is irrefutable. I hope to refute ( and disprove ) every allegation, but can not find a specializing lawyer to take my case on short notice. ( My attorney has quit ALL mortgage law cases, and I am left stranded. ) For XXXX years Bank of America has treated me in an unethical and fraudulent manner. I do not know whether the judge will listen to/look at my arguments/evidence and proof that they have committed many violations and are falsely alleging many things to give the appearance that I missed or defaulted on loan payments."
Mortgage,"Having XXXX XXXX as my loan officer was the worst thing that could have happened to me during this entire experience as a first time homebuyer. 

He gave me a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout out entire correspondence he was constantly needing new things from me - letters, paperwork, forms. Each time I gave him what he needed as soon as the next day. Then I wouldn't hear from him for days. My attorney tried to reach him, my realtor tried to reach him, at one point, the seller was threatening to cancel my contract because XXXX was not timely in sending my loan papers to them. When I would get a hold of him, it would be more things that he needed, all of which could have been done and provided weeks before coming up to the closing date. Not once throughout this process did he tell me the truth that the closing date was going to be delayed. So I scheduled movers, I packed my entire life in boxes, I scheduled XXXX to transfer my internet, I informed my roommate that she would be able to move in the coming weekend. Come the day before closing, surprise surprise, he's not ready to close. And there's more paperwork that needs to be done AND a 3 hour homebuyers course that he forgot to send me. 

I'm absolutely LIVID and STRESSED because this man doesn't have it together. I've done everything he's asked of me and I'm now dealing with the consequences of his inability to do his job. Now I need to ask my landlord if I can stay and pay for an extra month 's rent. He's inattentive, slow, and unapologetic- pretty rude too. He blames it on the underwriter, the process, me. He's not transparent as I'm still waiting to hear from him a new closing date. He tells me he'll call me back - doesn't happen unless you call him first. 

If it wasn't for this grant I was getting and how far in the loan process I am in already, I'd fire him and stick with XXXX XXXX. This man has royally XXXX me over and I know he's getting a commission from my loan that he absolutely does not deserve. 

Do NOT get a loan with XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX for that matter unless you like ripping out your own hair."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has shut off communications ( see Exhibit 1 ) and has refused to correct its mistaken duplicate lien that it added onto the subject property. Bank of America has failed to submit a title insurance claim to XXXX XXXX ( see Exhibit 2 ). 
Bank of America points its finger at XXXX. However, XXXX, the mortgage servicer only, was not the responsible mortgage note holder that created a duplicate erroneous lien ( see Exhibit 3 ) Bank of America was. Moreover, XXXX is a company that is out of business, and the fiduciary of XXXX corporate corpse accepts no responsibility ( see Exhibit 4 ). 
To repeat, Bank of America acquired the $ XXXX mortgage, for which the complainant has been paying for ever since then as part of her consolidated mortgage ( see Exhibit 5 ). But Bank of America, obligated to ensure that its new lien/mortgage didnt duplicate another lien/mortgage, failed to do so ( see Exhibit 6 ), leaving the complainant with extensive damages!!"

I spoke to various level in the mortgage supervisory chain and know one has fixed the problem. my complaint control number is XXXX. I have spent more than 8 hours on hold waiting to speak to someone, know one is fixing my problem. I included a letter signed by me with specific instructions to apply the payment to principal. In addition, i wrote apply to principal balance on the check. This is probably my 5th or 6th extra payment with the same instructions included each time."
Mortgage,"Bank of America sent me this FRAUDULENT DOCUMENT : IRS form XXXX for XXXX. 
How do I know if is fraudulent? It is because Bank of America has not held my primary mortgage loan since XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
See letters attached from BofA dated XXXX, XXXX, and from XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I never received any money from BofA, or any correspondence from them ever. I never was awarded any loan modification. I was never paid any refund or credit, nor notified of any overpayment of interest. 
The outstanding principal information on the form is not correct as recorded. 
I had applied to the Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for mortgage assistance on loan # XXXX ... .. due to financial hardship. Instead of replying to my application, without warning, they sold my loan. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called I called, four times, the customer service number on the letter XXXX and got the following explanations and responses : This amount was from a loan modification ( I responded "" I did not get any loan modification '' ) The amount was missed on the XXXX tax statement ( my loan was sold in XXXX XXXX ) The amount reflected overpaid interest in XXXX The amount was missed on the XXXX tax statement XXXX received overpay It is a write off on taxes I requested that they send me XXXX and XXXX tax records I was transferred to the YEAR END DEPARTMENT ( XXXX ) in order to get an explanation on the tax form. I was told the following : something was mentioned about a "" post modification bank '' I questioned what this was and was told it was about my loan modification I told them that I never got a loan modification and that my loan was sold XXXX XXXX. 
The person I spoke with said it was to my benefit, and was all good. And, that I just have to give the form to my accountant. 
I questioned this as the form represents income I never received. 
I went to the IRS website to research the form XXXX and saw that it represented a payment or credit. 
I made my FOURTH call to customer service and I talked to someone named XXXX who reviewed my earlier calls. She set up an inquiry and gave me a case number"

Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received an escrow overage check for XXXX from my mortgage company, Bank of America. The same day I also received documentation of an analysis that was completed on my account, and upon further review I noticed that my county taxes were not included on the new analysis projected amount and my house payment went from {$120000.00} to a new payment of {$1000.00} effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called BofA at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and spoke with a woman named XXXX to inquire on this since it did n't make sense to have a lower house payment and I wanted to ask why my taxes were now being excluded from escrow. I was told 'someone ', they did n't know who requested for that to happen on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, ( which my husband and I neither one did no such thing ). After much discussion I requested BofA to do a stop payment on the check, ( BofA wanted me to cash the check and make a 'payment ' back to them which also made no sense to me. I refused and requested the stop payment because I knew the money would not get applied back correctly to my escrow account ). At that point, I was told my issue was being sent to the 'escalation department ' and that I could call back on that Thursday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and everything should be taken care of. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I had to explain my entire scenario all over again and was given a Request ID # XXXX for the stop payment and was told funds would be reissued back into escrow. I was also told I would receive a phone call back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX central time to let me know the progress of the corrections of the stop payment, the correction of my house payment being restored to it 's original amount and when my XXXX taxes would be paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX. No one ever called. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received XXXX separate pieces of mail from BofA 1. 'Notice of Mortgage Payment Change ' stating my new total payment effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was now {$1000.00} and 2. A new loan analysis stating effective XX/XX/XXXX my new payment will be {$1500.00} with a shortage amount in my escrow account of $ XXXX. I called yet again and this time spoke with the manager of the floor ; XXXX XXXX. She strictly read the numbers off of the paper to me and basically said the analysis was correct. After much back and forth I came to the conclusion that the overage escrow amount of XXXX had not yet been credited back to my account. XXXX too, stated she was going to call me back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX p.m. central time and let me know where my account stood. She was going to have answers for the house payment amount, the stop payment on the check, let me know when my XXXX county taxes would be paid, let me know why it took 8 months for an analysis to happen IF it was requested on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. BUT, like the other person, XXXX never called me back either. On our XXXX/XXXX/XXXX call XXXX did give me her direct number since I stated my fear of not getting a call back. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I left her a voicemail at XXXX XXXX central time and have yet to hear from her. When my husband called in our house payment over the phone on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX he was told he owed a payment amount of {$1500.00} was due at which point he told the rep that he was paying {$1200.00} since these issues were being worked on. My fear however, it that these issues are just going to get shuffled away and we are very concerned. We have filed Chapter XXXX, but our house was not included on our bankruptcy. Since the bankruptcy department is the only department that will speak to us we feel we are at our last resort for help. I almost feel that these issues are intentionally happening since we are in bankruptcy and I am highly concerned our next letter we receive we will be threatened with foreclosure."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2023, I applied for a HELOC loan. I was given the terms and documentation needed to process my application. Over the past week or so I submitted the requested documents as need or as they became available to me. I spoke to the loan processor on couple of occasions, to give updated or he is giving me updates on additional information needed to process my application.one of the requested documentation was child support order, which I provided to them. Later on, I was asked to provide the 2nd page of the child support order. The second page to the divorce papers did not have anything to do with the child support order, which I advise them of that, however they still wanted page 2 of the divorce papers, so I provided to them. Couple days later they start asking for things I felt was not relevant for the processing of my application. I question the loan processor and was told that they believe that the second page of the divorce paper I sent was pretty much fake and believe it did not come from the divorce paper but came from somewhere else. The second issue was they asked for the proof of child support payment coming from the payee. I had the payee provided me with a 6-month history of wire transfer child support from his Bank of America account to my Bank of America account . Then they said that's not good enough we need to have proof that it went into your account, even-tho the wire transfer clearly shows the transfer coming from the payee account with his name and information to my account with my name and information. As time goes by it seems like they start asking for things that is impossible for me to provide them with or information of private and person nature. I asked the processor at one point, what are they allow legally to ask for because I felt they are beating around the bush to get thigs they are not legally allow to ask for but is finding a way to get it without straight out asking for what they trying to get. Then they said the property is not appraising where it needs to be. I asked for their appraisal and was told it's not available because a true appraisal was not done. At this point pretty much all the things they keep on asking for was provided to them, they also wanted a Proft and lost statement. I was not sure why a Proft and lost because I am a realtor not a business owner. I did provide it to them. Then they asked for my ex-husband to sign an Authorization to release information. I question them on the reason why he would need to sign that form when he is not applying with me and was told that they need information and the mortgage. I said I already provided you the mortgage statement and anything else you need can be obtain my you the bank as to the evidence of title. I told them that my ex-husband will not sign that form. The loan processor stated he will consult with his manager and get back with me. I received a call back from the loan office stated that they can not process the application if my ex-husband doesn't sign the form. I asked again why he would need to sign the form if he is not applying with me, I was then told that they need to see if he had any late mortgage payment. I stated that if he had any late payments that should have no bearing on my ability because I am the one getting the loan and my credit is the only credit that is being used. I also mention that I am not on the mortgage, and from my understanding all my ex-husband would have to do is sign the paperwork at closing acknowledging that I am taking out a loan. I was then told that if he had any lates on the mortgage that it will not be counted against me, well if that is the case why do he need to sign the authorization to release form. Then I was told that they need to know the kind of mortgage and the interest rate in order to proceed with the application. I said I am lost, I thought was important was to make sure the mortgage is current and there is no lien and any negative issue that would affect you extending the credit. It seems like anything I told them is impossible to provide is what they say they have to have to procced with the loan. Then they ask for the full divorce decree, I advise them that there is private and sensitive information in it that I am not at liberty to disclose to them regarding my ex-husband. I also offer to provide whatever they need specifically form the divorce decree. But of course, they stated that they want the full divorce decree and for him to sign the authorization to release information in order to continue with the application. At this point, I feel that they are intentionally imposing unfair requirements on me just to not give me the loan. I feel this is boarder line redlining and predatory lending practice. the 2 documents that they know I can't provide them is the only 2 documents they are using to deny my application."

Mortgage,"I previously did a complaint with Bank of America on this matter and only one of two issues were resolved. They did advise that their XXXX loan on this land was transferred to XXXX BUT they did NOT resolve the issue on the mobile home which sits on this property. 

In XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX received a loan from Bank of America which put a lien against the land located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA AND the mobile home located on said land known as "" XXXX XXXX, Model Starcrest, Serial Nos. XXXX ''. 

In XXXX the XXXXXXXX XXXX refinanced this property again with Bank of America, and said loan is still being paid at this time and we are NOT asking for a release for this loan. What we are asking for ONLY is for Bank of America to remove their lien from the mobile home as the XXXX loan was paid in full in XXXX. Attached you will find the XXXX Title Search showing the lien on the mobile home is specifically for the XXXX loan ONLY as the loan in XXXX did not put a lien on the mobile home. I have also attached a copy of the 1st page of the XXXX Deed of Trust and the Full Reconveyance that was recorded in XXXX which removed the XXXX lien off the land but not off the mobile home. 

I have been advised over and over that THIS loan ( XXXX ) was transferred to XXXX in XXXX but you can not transfer a paid/closed/release in full loan since it no longer exists. If BofA was able to record a Full Reconveyance in XXXX for land they are also obligated by law to release the lien from the mobile home that was secured by the same XXXX loan that has been PAID IN FULL. 

Please make sure that someone from BofA has a representative that is familiar with how mobile home liens work deal with this complaint because the regular loan parties just are not understanding this matter."
Mortgage,"Bank of America recently "" updated '' their system "" to better serve their customers. '' Part of this update, though, was not done to serve their customers, it was done to reduce customers ' savings on interest after making additional payments towards their principal. Prior to this update, when additional principal payment was made with a regular payment, the "" principal curtailment '' was applied PRIOR to the regular monthly payment. This reduced the interest and increased the principal payment proportional to the additional principal payment for that month 's payment. Now, the principal curtailment is applied AFTER the monthly payment which makes the interest savings from the additional payment not apply until the next month 's payment. This is nothing short of a sneaky way for Bank of America to increase their bottom line. Just for my account that takes about {$7.00} out of my savings each month. Spread this across the millions of accounts Bank of America has and they are likely taking millions of dollars from their customers."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received Mortgage Satisfaction, Letter from Bank of America. Called Bank of America, to inform the paper work was Incomplete. File complaint on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Bank of America called me on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America is unwell to give me a date when they will release missing title to my home. On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America received payment Of XXXX to close the loan. It has 146 days and counting And still I can not prove I own the home I live in."
Mortgage,I did a refinance with Bank of America. I have owned this investement property for 10 years and have paid a total of {$35000.00} in PMI as the loan to value was not XXXX %. the PMI payment is {$300.00} a month. currently the LTV is over XXXX %. Owe XXXX and appraisals are coming back at {$410000.00}. I have requested 5 times total to remove and they refuse. Also apparently they changed the terms in the refinance that it is now XXXX % LTV and minimum 2 years before they will look at it. I have offered to make a one time payment to reach the XXXX % and they said they would be happy to take my money but would have to again apply to get PMI removed. I do n't understand. Unprofessional. Bank of America is taking advantage of there consumers and not notifying them of these line items.
Mortgage,"Bank of America and myself have had a very long history on my home mortgage. I purchased the house in XXXX-refinanced with Bank of America XXXX, home equity loan which allowed me to pay my own taxes. In XXXX. Bank of America changed the terms of the agreement and began to escrow the account to cover homeowner taxes, insurance, water, sewer and trash bills ( {$2500.00} ) a year. In XXXX, I refinance the home loan with another lender. Bank of America provided information that all my XXXX taxes, insurances, water, sewer and trash bills would be paid from the accumulated escrow applied to the back end of the loan. I only owed {$46000.00} on the exiting loan, however Bank of America added over {$10000.00} in escrow amounts to the loan. I had never been late of the loan monthly agreed mortgage payments, they claim this escrow was for taxes. I recently received a tax bill from XXXX. The total pay off amounts where at the end of XXXX XXXX, total pay off of the loan was XXXX, which was pay off by another banking company. There should not be any taxes still owed in XXXX, according to the documentations and information provided to me at the time of the pay off of the exiting loan. Bank of America refuse to provide me with a refund of the differences in escrow at the time and now I owe for XXXX. This procedure can not be accurate."
Mortgage,"Recently Bank of America foreclosed on my families home ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) after they failed to follow through on a home modification ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). After my wife became unemployed due to a matter concerning our children we began to have difficulty making payments. The loan was acquired in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and we began to have major difficulties in XX/XX/XXXX. We attempted in XX/XX/XXXX to get help right when we notified them of my wife 's unemployment, but were denied. We were told as long as we stay within 2 months of late payment were were fine so we kept making payments. Eventually we started to get foreclosure information from Bank of America and after applying for a modification two more times BOA agreed to a modification where we pay XXXX per month for a year to pay the past due balance for 3 months ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). Initially, we were only falling 2 months behind ( XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) before we were able to pay our regular payment, but they forced us into 3 month behind so they could create an agreement though technically we were only 2 months behind almost XXXX. After we successfully completed the agreement of 12 months from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( We never missed a payment on the modified payment plan agreement and followed the plan as stated XXXX in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as scheduled we were to return to our normal regularly scheduled payments which were set to start XXXX XX/XX/XXXX according to the modification agreement we had signed a year earlier in XX/XX/XXXX. However, they did not allow us to return to our regularly scheduled payments, instead they demanded that we pay over XXXX the same month we were to start our payments back ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) saying we were past due and the home is in the foreclosure process. Each month they kept increasing what we owe. We could n't understand how when we followed the agreement. BOA made us feel as if we did something wrong and said for us to keep applying for a modification to help with over XXXX past due bill. Eventually BOA stated we had to pay what was due on the loan about XXXX plus XXXX. We kept applying for assistance for modifications ( from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and they denied us over and over even though my wife had gotten a job during the process and the income had increased some and we reported it. BOA kept sending us through a harsh application process and would misplace papers, not respond, etc. Finally, after they broke the contract agreement and wrongfully foreclosed on our home XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which forced us to hire an attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and we filed a suit against BOA in XXXX XXXX. We are a family of XXXX that includes XXXX children we have had to go through having random people for months show up at our home, people knocking on the door asking if we want to stay and they will buy the house, but we can pay them, which scared our children. People walking around our home during numerous times of the day and peering through out windows. The humility of having our home online under foreclosed homes for sale. Now the case have been in federal court for months ( XXXX, TX ) and BOA recently tried to negotiate with our attorney to have us get the loan back from them and start back make payments after they wrongfully took our deed by breaching a contract and wrongfully foreclosing on our home. BOA wishes to proceed as if they never violated a contract and wrongfully foreclosed on our home causing us to suffer mistreatment and expenses due to their actions. They know the contract stated for us to return to our normal payments, not submit any balloon payment. We would like assistance. BOA has mistreated us for a long time and they still are attempting to get away with mistreatment. We are not accepting such deal and would like to see consequences for their actions. They are not exercising good business practices. We would like immediate action to be taken against BOA."
Mortgage,"I never received this Withdrawal Letter and and loan application from XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, # XXXX/XXXX  XXXX, CA, XXXX Who has an zip code with XXXX XXXX 's at the end. Never had the phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I never had liens of {$140000.00} and had no subordinate financing of {$9000.00}. I never spoke with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2008. This is fraud. I never had assets of {$200000.00} and then seven days later have another {$4000.00} in assets on the refinance. I didn't know who Countrywide XXXXome Loans was until I received my first billing statement in XX/XX/2008. This is why I never received copies of anything from Countrywide for the HELOC and the refinance because they falsified my loan documents after I sent them back by mail. Also, if your implying I told Countrywide Bank by telephone I had all these assets they would have had to have verified it and itemized it for the loan. I sent in documentation as to my income. I find it funny that the other two loan applications were from XXXX, Arizona from XXXX XXXX. The licensing for these loans was in Arizona. For the refinance, Countrywide Home Loans Inc. # XXXX  ,XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA., XXXX was closed in Arizona on XX/XX/2008. So where did the money go if I didn't sign a loan application until XX/XX/2008. You can say you were just the loan servicer and you consider this closed but now I'm sending all information to the Attorney General 's office with all the proof including my promissory note. Do you think if I had all those assets I would have lost my home. I don't care how old this is. Your falsifying a document that should have been sent to me last year when I requested all documents from my file. Bank of America also falsified another document. So I have two documents one from Bank of America and one from XXXX XXXX. This is far from over."
Mortgage,"We were selling our home and needed a closing statement for our Home Equity line of credit of {$250000.00} from Bank of America. The closing was XX/XX/2020. I called Bank Of America on XX/XX/XXXX requesting the closing statement be sent to my Attorney. There was a XXXX  balance on the account and I was told the statement would be received on XX/XX/XXXX. My Attorney did not receive the Closing Statement. When I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by Supervisor XXXX there was a {$620.00} early closing fee that needed to be paid before the a the account could be closed. We transferred {$620.00} to the account that day. Again my Attorney did not receive the Closing Statement. To complete the sale of our home and the Title Company had {$250000.00} held in escrow until a Closing Statement was issued. 
I again called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX about this matter and spoke with XXXX XXXX and later with Supervisor XXXX. XXXX told me the delays were due to a "" System Conversion ''  and we would receive the Closing Statement on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX this account has not been closed and my Attorney has not received the Closing Statement. We were given a Reference Number XXXX when we last called."
Mortgage,"In XXXX 2010 we filed an official application for HAMP with Bank Of America and provided some XXXX pages of documents with the application.For an entire year, even though they confirmed receiving the documents each time, they continually lost our file. And they continually gave us false information about the HAMP Program.Then they sent us to another dept. and did a HARP refi and told us it was a prerequisite to HAMP-the refi cost us {$8000.00} in closing costs and did not lower our payment enough to stay in the home and we defaulted.When we reapplied for HAMP they told us the HARP refi made us ineligible for any further modification with HAMP-the opposite of what Bank Of America told us.Now we are facing foreclosure and have no modification programs available to us because Bank Of America cheated us out of getting in the HAMP Program and sold us the worthless expensive HARP."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2023 I notified BOA agents over the phone of my COVID positive results causing XXXX XXXX from work with lesser pay. I requested a forbearance at the same time and was told I didn't qualify. I told them I can only make partial payments with the XXXX checks that I'd receive from work. Over the phone agents told me I can make partial payments, but when I attempted to make the partial payments in person, they refused my payments telling me they can only receive full payments. I was told I was good for XXXX so I made a payment for XXXX using my last check from work for wages earned in XXXX. I again asked for forbearance. They again refused. I had to wait to get my checks from XXXX to make my next payment, but again they would not accept partial payments. I had to save 3 checks to pay 1 full month. I also explained this to them. I informed them I was to be on XXXX XXXX from XXXX. I made payments as I could. The last payment was made in XX/XX/. I received a Delinquency notices on XX/XX/XXXX  & XX/XX/XXXX  for the months of XX/XX/, XX/XX/, and XX/XX/XXXX  and if I didn't bring account current I was going to be charged for foreclosure fees and foreclosure. They applied these foreclosure process fees on same month, XX/XX/. I received another notice on or about XXXX by courier I believe who stated he had to give me the envelope & take pictures of the outside of my house. He confirmed BOA started the foreclosure process because I was behind on my mortgage and in the envelope was the delinquency notice again reading that I'm late on payments and will be charged as mentioned above. Also charging me the {$800.00} for starting the foreclosure process. I called them again telling them I recvd their notice sent by person and told them they started the foreclosure process too soon as I was not 120 days past due. I asked again for repayment option as I was returning to work on XX/XX/. The agent on the phone said there's no way for me or them to know if I am returning to work on XX/XX/XXXX  and that the only option I had was a modification denying me the repayment option. I told her I have a 1.125 % interest rate now and modifying it to todays rate is not beneficial for me as it's over 6 %. I again requested the repayment option she refused and the call ended. I have not been able to make payments online nor in person for months already and now I am far behind on my mortgage. I've tried making payments, but they were not and are not being accepted. It was not been 120 days behind per TX Federal Rules & Civil Codes. As BOA reported to the credit bureaus, my last payment was made on XX/XX/. They reported they started foreclosure proceedings on XXXX, but they sent someone on XXXX. Therefore, they started the foreclosure process on XX/XX/. Now I am more than 120 days behind on my mortgage payments. I did return to work on XX/XX/2023 and would like to have my mortgage loan reinstated so that I may continue to make my payments. I noticed that my payment went up over {$200.00} and when I asked BOA abou this, they couldn't really carify. I believe it is for the escrow going up though. I can still pay the monthly payments and would like to start paying again. Can you please help me with this issue?"
Mortgage,"I have had a home loan with Bank of America for 8+ years on my personal residence. I have never had an escrow or impound account with B of A on ANY property. In late XXXX Bank of America fraudulently charged me on this loan for property taxes they mistakenly paid on a different loan/property that no longer existed, I had previously sold a property in XXXX and all debt was paid off to B of A. B of A refused to remove that charge. After numerous complaints and finally a CFPB complaint they finally removed the charge and admitted the "" error ''. B of A finally corrected this current loan. 
Now, just a few months later they appear to be purposely harassing me again. I have never had a impound or escrow account for my property taxes or insurance. Bank of America has now made a payment on my property taxes without my permission an opened another impound/escrow account on this loan/property. B of A has starting charging me for taxes and insurance and applied my extra payments in a way that I do not authorize. I have called B of A on XXXX and asked for an investigation and they have never corresponded or even called back as they have promised. Since then I sent the payment for the property tax payment and my regular P & I. B of A has fraudulently applied my payment to double the normal amount of interest, some to principle, and only a partial payment to the property taxes. This is outright FRAUD. How could you they apply DOUBLE the interest from on time payments? 
Previously I waited several months for this to be resolved so I could refinance. Now that I am in the middle of a refinance to get away from B of A they will undoubted misrepresent the payoff amounts and try to keep money they are not entitled to. Bank of America can not be trusted to service a simple existing P & I loan."
Mortgage,"I have submitted 2 complaints with CFPB # XXXX and # XXXX for Bank of America Home Loan account no # XXXX. Now the bank is retaliating and has suspending my account, claiming that my payment is past due. BofA hasn't corrected the issue and is showing balance on my account incorrect ( it's been many months and I see random activities on my account daily from BofA ). Additionally, I am on auto pay from my BofA checking account so there is no way I could be late on my payment. I am totally disappointed on BofA and feel mistreated and harassed."
Mortgage,I realized my bank had made XXXX payments for homeowner policy when they notified me that my escrow account was short and it resulted in increased monthly payments.
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, 2011 the law showed up and our home to evict us due to foreclosure, along with my children one week before XXXX. We had fought with Bank of America for 1.5 yrs, trying to resolve when my husband and I both lost our home, we even had payoff which Bank of America refused, why, because the mortgage was wrote off and the sell of my home was profit only for Bank of America. We were told we would receive the paperwork we needed to sign and return so keep our home within two weeks, they came and went no paperwork, we called again withint two weeks, this went on and on. Needless to say we lost the home in which i grew up in and my children grew up in a house i had paid off XXXX mortgages for. Not only did Bank of America force us into Insurance that raised my payment from {$640.00} to {$1100.00} per month, they lied and would call us XXXX or more times a day or their machines would call us. We went to the debt counselors required of us and they to said we could keep our home if we followed instructions which we did to no avail. So, in the settlement we got a grand total of around {$800.00}, which was nothing more than an insult. We moved into a house which by all rights should have been condemned, we stayed there as long as we could getting together the money to move, we now live in a place that at best is barely standing, i have elderly family ( father ) that i have to stay close to. I hope anyone reading this never uses Bank of America, my husband and i both work and do not receive government assistance in any form. Yet, we have lost everything, there was nothing then nor now to help us recoup anything we lost, our credit our home was stripped by Bank of America while they gave themselves million dollar bonuses with the money i work and pay into taxes. Yet, no one was there to bail my family out. I know just in my area there were several that went through the same problems my family did. So much for the American Dream!!!"
Mortgage,"We have had mortgages with Bank of America for many years dating back to about XXXX. About 4 years ago we refinanced our mortgage on a 30 year ARM with a balance of {$140000.00}. Since the refinancing we have paid the balance down to about {$70000.00}. 
In XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from the bank that they needed our most recent insurance policy naming the bank as an insured party. My insurance agent faxed the policy a requested on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we received another letter indicating they had no record of the policy. I contacted BofA at the number provided and ultimately spoke with their representative XXXX XXXX. He acknowledged there was a miscue at the bank regarding our original fax, and provided a specific case number and direct fax line for my agent to use to send the policy. That same day, XXXX XXXX confirmed to my insurance agent that BofA had received the policy. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the bank made a premium payment of {$4500.00}, an amount more than XXXX times my regular homeowner 's insurance premium, with no explanation as to the rationale. The amount of coverage on the bank issued policy was XXXX times the mortgage balance and in excess of XXXX % of the full replacement cost of the property. The online record says the Bank 's records indicate they are responsible for paying premiums although, to my recollection, we never have had an escrow account with the bank. As a result of the payment there is a {$4500.00} deficiency in the escrow account. 
We learned of the payment by reviewing our on-line activity on XX/XX/XXXX, at which time we made phone contact with the bank. I requested to speak with supervisor and was directed to XXXX XXXX ( sp? ). After reviewing the record, she informed me she would speak with the proper authorities about reversal of the payment charged to the escrow account. She also committed to frequent contact with us concerning disposition. After no contacts from XXXX XXXX, We left phone messages on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX requesting an update. We have received no responses to our phone messages. 
We therefore seek the assistance of the CFPB."
Mortgage,"I have a Countrywide mortgage that originated in XXXX. Bank of America states that they service the loan for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America wrote to me ( letter attached ) : "" After reviewing the new documents and information you provided to support your appeal, the loan is still not eligible for the following program ( s ) for the reason ( s ) indicated below. Since the reason ( s ) your loan modification wasn't approved hasn't changed, you may not request another appeal review. 

Bank of America Loan Modification Program : your loan isn't eligible for this program for the reason ( s ) stated below : Under applicable program requirements, we seek to reduce the monthly mortgage payment to equal a target payment that is a specified percentage of your gross monthly income through a series of steps that include evaluation of the impact of eliminating interest and amortization on a portion of the principal balance of your loan by forbearance of this portion ( subject to the requirement that it does not exceed a specified percentage of the amount of your loan. Because your gross monthly income of {$520000.00} is so low relative to the outstanding amount of your loan, the portion of the amount of your loan as to which we would need to eliminate interest and amortization would exceed the specified percentage. '' On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Bank of America Resolution Specialist, Regulatory Complaints, wrote to me in response to a Complaint I made to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( letter attached ) : "" On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America received a request to appeal our previous decision that this loan was not eligible for a loan modification. Further research indicates there was no additional information or income provided for the appeal, than what was originally submitted for the initial review. Our records indicate we used the average of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX rental income to calculate the gross monthly income of {$5200.00}. Please understand that when considering rental income, there is a vacancy factor of 75 percent and debt services ( i.e. outstanding mortgage on a rental property ) that are accounted for. The enclosed letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, advised you the loan modification appeal you submitted had been denied. '' XXXX XXXX was the first person at Bank of America to explain to me that when considering rental income it had been reduced by 75 percent. This was not explained in the XX/XX/XXXX letter to me. All that was explained was that my "" gross monthly income of {$5200.00} is so low relative to the outstanding amount of your loan, the portion of the amount of he loan as to which we would need to eliminate interest and amortization would exceed the specified percentage. '' The XX/XX/XXXX letter quoted a gross monthly income which was not correct and which had been reduced by 75 percent. I only had rental income for the months of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I was never informed that the appeal needed more information and it was understood that all of the financial information I had provided was everything that I had. 

I was appealing the figure of {$5200.00} as not accurate. Nobody informed me that that amount was arrived at by reducing my rental income ( which was all of my income ) by 75 %. The appeal was to figure out how my income of over {$15000.00} per month had been reduced to {$5200.00}. 

If a customer earning {$20000.00} ( 4 x {$5200.00} ) or {$15000.00} ( 3 x {$5200.00} ) is not told upfront that their rental income ( which was my only income ) will be reduced by 75 percent and is not told when they are denied but only told when they file a complaint with the CFPB what does that say about how Bank of America is handling old Countrywide loans? Is this reasonable? Bank of America was not clear in their XX/XX/XXXX letter about how they arrived at such a low gross income and in factthe gross income figure of {$5200.00} was arrived at by reducing my gross income ( all of my income was from rental income ) by seventy-five percent. This was then used to state I would not be apply to afford the monthly modification payments. 

The normal industry standard is : "" They usually use 75 % of your total reported [ rental ] income 25 % is subtracted to account for potential vacancies and ongoing maintenance. https : //www.valuepenguin.com/mortgages/claiming-rental-income-for-mortgage. 

In addition, My Countrywide loan has been the subject of different class action settlements and this settlement : https : //www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bank-america-pay-1665-billion-historic-justice-department-settlement-financial-fraud-leading https : //www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/countrywide-settlement-fact-sheet/ The settlement states : These goals are achieved with a number of loan modification options, including : A reduction of the interest rate to as low as 3.5 % for five years, at which time the loan will be converted to a fixed interest rate set at the greater of the Fannie Mae rate or the introductory interest rate on the loan. If that rate is still unaffordable, the reduced interest rate can be extended for another two years ; A reduction of the interest rate to as low as 2.5 % with annual step rate increases, subject to a lifetime cap on the interest rate on the loan ; A 10-year interest-only modification, with an interest rate reduction to as low as 3.5 % for these modifications and yearly step rate increases, subject to a lifetime cap on the interest rate on the loan.

My Countrywide loan which has been at 6 percent since XXXX and has never been modified, is eligible for modification under the above settlement, following the above guidelines and should have already been modified.

Mortgage,"Statement of the CaseAround XXXX, we began to experience the same devastation the economy was having on many others. The loss of income and deaths of XXXX un/under-insured family members further contributed to our financial hardship. In fear of getting behind on house payments, I contacted Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX requesting a loan modification ; only to be told that our income, at the time, was only about $ 1000/month short and that we did not qualify according to XXXX XXXX XXXX 's pre-qualification criteria. By this time XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, we still had no additional income and had used all our savings ; which resulted in our first late house payment, subsequently followed by others, along with further loss of income. Borrowing from friends, co-workers, and family, we were current on payments by XXXX XXXX ; but only to get behind again due to further loss of income. The overwhelming financial stress climaxed into a medical emergency in XXXX XXXX when I had to rush my wife to the ER, XXXX resulting from stress, according to the attending medical professionals. In XXXX XXXX, I was rushed to ER, XXXX for a medical condition in which I had no knowledge nor forewarning. I was told the condition could have been triggered by tremendous stress. 
From about XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX, we applied for mortgage loan modifications at least 18 times.

Mortgage,"**See Printer-Friendly PDF version of this complaint ( Complaint vs Bank of America.pdf ) ** Hello, I am filing this complaint against Bank of America ( BoA ) for unfair lending practices which include the following : 1. Not applying mortgage payments correctly 2. Mismanagement of escrows 3. Misreporting mortgage account status to customer and credit reporting agencies 4. Requiring unnecessary mortgage insurance premium ( MIP ) 5. Charging unnecessary additional fees Since XX/XX/XXXX, I started paying my escrow on my own and only paid my Principal & Interest ( P & I ) to Bank of America due to mismanagement of my escrows and continued assessment of mortgage insurance premium even though Ive owned my home for over 16 years. Below are the details of my complaint : On XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America to inquire about unscheduled increase in my mortgage payment. My monthly payment had increased from {$2000.00} to {$3900.00} to {$4100.00}. I was informed by the representative that I had a {$1000.00} escrow shortage. ( See attached BoA Escrow Shortage Pmt XXXX ) I paid that amount in full over the phone to bring my escrow current that day. I was told that my mortgage payment would go back down to {$3900.00} once the payment was processed in the system the following month or the billing cycle after that. That did not happen. 

Five months later, in XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage payment increased once again to {$4100.00}. I was not aware of that increase until XX/XX/XXXX when my mortgage again increased yet again to {$4200.00}. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about these payment increases, I was told it was due to another shortage in escrow. That same day I paid another {$930.00} over the phone to satisfy the shortage in escrow. ( See attached BoA Escrow Shortage Pmt XXXX ) Once again, I was told that my mortgage payment would go back down to {$4100.00} once the payment was processed. The Following month the mortgage statement was still {$4200.00}. 

After making all these payments toward my escrow, my account never went back to {$3900.00} nor {$4100.00}. This led me to conclude that BoA is willfully incompetent in managing my escrows and/or deliberately using escrow mismanagement as a way to : 1. increase customers mortgage payment and 2. charge unnecessary mortgage insurance premium Because of the escrow mismanagement and unfair practices, I appealed the increases and the MIP charge over the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. When I did not receive a response, I once again appealed in writing on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX ( See attached BoA Letters_Attachments.pdf ). I requested that BoA do the following : 1. Remove escrows from my mortgage payments and allow me to manage payments of my taxes and insurance on my own.

2. BoA to reassess the value of my home to take into consideration the current estimated home values from independent third parties, specifically, XXXX, Redfin.com and XXXX and discontinue MIP charges. 

I provided BoA with copies of the above third-party reports ( See attached XXXX XXXX XXXX ) showing the current average value of my home at {$630000.00} not the {$510000.00} that I paid for the home 15 years ago that BoA continues to use to value my home. As an alternative, I suggested in my letter that BoA may conduct its own appraisal to have a more accurate value of my home if the submitted estimates were not sufficient. 

On XX/XX/XXXX BoA denied my request on the basis that I lack equity in my home ( See attached BoA Denied Letter to Remove Escrow.pdf ). BoA indicated that my loan-to-value ( LTV ) was 83 % and needed to be at 80 %. They refused to use my current home value which is nearly {$150000.00} more than the original price in XXXX. They indicated that they only consider the sell price. However, the LTV stated in the denied letter is not consistent with neither current value nor the sell price. 

BoA accepted the monthly P & I payments without fail, through XX/XX/XXXX. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the branch to make my monthly P & I payment, the teller indicated that they can not accept my payment anymore. To ensure my payment would not be late, I made my payment online via ACH from my bank. After the payment was processed electronically, BoA refunded my account on XX/XX/XXXX. ( See attached BoA Monthly Mortg Pmt Branch XXXX and Mortg Pmt Transactions From XXXX showing all payment transactions from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ) To ensure I maintain my monthly payment to BoA in a timely manner as Ive always done, I again made my XXXX P & I payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Once again, BoA refunded my mortgage payments back to my account a week later on XX/XX/XXXX ( See attached BoA Returned XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I have since transferred my mortgage payments to a savings account at XXXX XXXX  and will continue to do so until this matter is resolved. Also, since XXXX, I paid my taxes and insurance separately on my own ( See attached BoA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Insurance Overpayment XXXX ). BoA, however, have overrode my payments resulting to overpayment of both my taxes and insurance. I have saved all taxes and insurance funds as well as the last 2 months of P & I payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an Intent to Accelerate letter from BoA ( See attached BoA Notice Intent to Accelerate.pdf ). They have also sent me notices assessing me the following unnecessary charges : On XX/XX/XXXX, {$290.00} Title Fee ( See attached BoA Title XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, {$17.00} Inspection-Occupied fee ( See attached XXXX XXXX XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to get an update on my account because my online access has been disabled, BoA informed me that I am already in foreclosure."
Mortgage,"My Credit Report dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 is showing several delinquencies for late payment. These periods are a part of a XXXX modifications. My Bank of America contact person for the modification told me that they are fixing all these once the modification is approved but I still see these payments marked as late. I send a letter to the bank disputing the late payments because I was never late and they send me a letter telling me that the information that they provide to the credit report is accurate and that information is the same as the credit report that I was dispute with them several months ago."
Mortgage,"Sir/Madam, Bank of America is still continuing to not give me the runaround about Mortgage Forbearance I applied for. I have been ill and was laid off from my job. After spending almost all my saving to continue to pay my mortgage I could pay it any longer so I informed Bank of America and requested for Special Forbearance which is the FHA government assisted program for homeowners who are unemployed or sick and therefore are unable to pay their mortgage. The Special Forbearance program was for the Banks to suspend mortgage payments of unemployed homeowners for 12 months until they get a job to resume paying their mortgages.
Bank of has been giving me the runaround like saying they have not received all me documents after telling me that they had received all my documents and that it going for a review. Then will turn around and send me another letter that they have not received all the documents. At times, when I called about the conflicting statements they would tell me to ignore the subsequent letters and that they are being generated automatically. This has been going since  XX/XX/XXXX , and I had to file a complaint in   XXXX   with CPFB. After asking me to resubmit the whole application package again, they let me know again in  XXXX  that they have received all my documents. The time I insisted that they put this writing in a form of a letter which they did by sending a letter dated  XX/XX/XXXX  stating that my application is complete and that they evaluating for the loan assistance programs.
Later I received a letter from Bank of America dated  XX/XX/XXXX , stating that I only qualified for Short Sale of my house.They had tried this Short Sale on me in  XX/XX/XXXX  and I told them I needed Special Forbearance according to the FHA regulation.
The Special Forbearance which I actually applied for and which I am qualified for because I have been ill and unemployed, they are now telling me that I did not qualify for it because they said I am delinquency exceeds 12 months. But actually, my delinquency have not exceeded 12 months. Despite their attempts giving me the runaround to have to make delinquency exceeds 12 months, it has not because my first complaint to CFPB forced them to work on my application. After I have pointed this out to   XXXX   XXXX   and   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    respectively, they could not give me any specific or reasonable answer why I am within the 12 months of delinquency and they have not considered me for the Special Forbearance which was the program I applied for straight from the beginning of my application.
According to FHA regulations - The Special Forbearance ( SFB ) - Unemployment Option is a Home Retention Option available when one or more of the Borrowers has become unemployed and this loss of employment has negatively affected the Borrowers ability to continue to make their monthly Mortgage Payment.
The Mortgage must meet the following condition at the time the SFB - Unemployment Agreement is executed : be at least three months past due ( 61 Days Delinquent ), but not more than 12 months due and unpaid As a matter of fact, FHA came out with a new regulation in  XX/XX/XXXX  which has asked banks to "" Eliminate the minimum 12-month delinquency term to qualify for FHAs special forbearance option, which will allow servicers extend this option to unemployed households sooner in their delinquency ''.
More importantly, I have been offered a job by a government contractor and I have to do a Federal Security Clearance. My preliminary investigation came last week and they preliminary denied my clearance because of the Bank of America delinquencies which Bank of America reported to the Credit Bureaus. When I was filling up the forms I explained to TSA, the agency, why I was in delinquent and that I was working with Bank of America to get Special Forbearance to suspend my mortgage and allow me to find an employment.
Anyway, I was informed that the best way I could get the clearance is to show proof that I have paid the delinquent amount or get the Special Forbearance and present TSA with the Special Forbearance letter. So I really need the Special Forbearance which I qualify for to allow me to get the clearance to start working I pay my delinquent amount."
Mortgage,"My father and stepmother ( both passed away in XXXX ) had taken out a home equity line of credit with Bank of America in XXXX. After the passing, we put their home up for sale. We found a buyer and the home was supposed to close on XXXX. The title company located this XXXX line of credit and showed it was still in force. No one was aware that this deed existed prior to the title search. The closing attorney in Georgia attempted to contact Bank of America on several occasions to get the deed cancelled. They were unsuccessful. As Executor of the estate, I told matters in my own hands and went to my local ( XXXX Florida branch ) on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to try to resolve it. I was put in touch with an investigator, who told me that the deed was not in their digit system. This would require a hand search. He told me that it would take 3 to 4 days to get solved. The case number was assigned ( # XXXX ). Today XX/XX/XXXX, BOA notified the closing attorney that it would take 15 days to resolve this. This is completely unacceptable. I have buyers who are ready to walk. I have allowed them to move in pre-closing because I thought this would be resolved this week. BOA 's failure to resolve this is costing the Estate and the buyer money for each day this goes on. This need to be resolved yesterday and not 15 days from now. The latest correspondence from BOA is below : Thank you for submitting the necessary information required to review your lien release. Please be assured that we are working to fulfill your request. We ask that you allow 15 business days for completion. Status updates are not available via email. For all status and questions, please contact Customer Service at ( XXXX ) XXXX and provide reference number XXXX."
Mortgage,"part of the National Mortgage Settlement, BofA Modified my first TD and was to extinguish the 2nd Mortgage Lien. This is included in the judgment. its also listed on page 12 of the National consumer Law Center "" understanding the National Mortgage Settlement '' it states : Bank of American delivers additional second-line mortgage relief to homeowners through an extinguishment program. The bank sends borrowers including those who have filed chapter XXXX or chapter XXXX bankruptcy, a one page letter describing the program. A Homeowner who does not want the mortgage lien extinguished must contact Bank of America within 30 days. if the homeowner does not respond, the second lien is released and the associated debt forgiven. Given the opt-out structure, participation rates in the program are reportedly extremely high. Bank of America reports these extinguished debts to credit bureaus as paid in full. .... this is my case, i currently have a creditor who is trying to foreclosure on my property relating to the 2nd mortgage that was extinguished through the National Mortgage Settlement judgment. They have filed for a notice of sale and was force to file Bankruptcy because they do not want listen and review the National Mortgage settlement act. B of A did not complete the process and filed the Recon to release the lien as stated in the law suit. My first was modified and part of the principle was forgiven. The company who is acting as the lien holder for the 2nd does not want to acknowledge and is requesting for the foreclosure proceedings to continue. Its been so much pain going through this process again knowing they dont have any rights for try and collect on a 2nd mortgage that was included in the National Mortgage Settlement judgment."
Mortgage,"This complaint is in regards of mishandling of our fixed credit line loan by Bank of America. On XX/XX/XXXX, we have signed loan documents on a fixed rate loan from B of A, with an amortization schedule and a Note, reflecting a Principal/Interest payment of {$820.00}. 

However, when we have noticed that our automatically withdrawn payments are all being applied towards interest only, we have started contacting the originating loan officer and the bank 's customer service and research department. 

At first, we were constantly told that our payments are applied towards both principal and interest, as intended at the origination, however, after persisting to look more in depth, the customer service department did in fact confirm that the payments were applied ONLY towards interest, but not the principal. 

After many frustrating and LONG phone calls, on XX/XX/XXXX, we were finally assured that the errors on bank 's behalf have been corrected, and we have been sent a letter and corrected amortization schedule from B of A 's ALS Research department on XX/XX/XXXX. However, when we checked our statement, our XX/XX/XXXX payment yet AGAIN was applied towards interest only. 

We have tried to contact the person who initially stated the corrections were made and assured us that no more mistakes will be seen, and the originating loan XXXXfficer. However, no one has replied to our requests. 
Furthermore, once we called Customer service on XX/XX/XXXX, we were told that not only our past and XXXX payment were applied towards interest only, but our XX/XX/XXXX payment is also scheduled to be applied towards interest only. 

As of right now, on XX/XX/XXXX, we were told that the errors are going to be corrected again."
Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 a repersentive from HUD stated "" Bank of America submitted a new variance request over to HUD today and we have approved this and let BAC know and they will now be moving the file forward. Let me know if you need further assistance. "" As of today, XXXX/XXXX/2015, BAC has not moved the file forward in the 7 days since then? The variance was approved. The offer I sent on XXXX/XXXX/2015 meets the minimum net and is not requesting any closing cost assistance. We should have an approval letter by now. Why is BAC dragging their feet? 

Also, BAC has scheduled a foreclosure sale on this property despite having the short sale contract package since XXXX/XXXX/2015."

Mortgage,"Back in XXXX, my husband and I were behind on our mortgage with Bank of America, I did a quick deed and my home was put in my name, Bank of America did nothing to help us, they transferred our loan to another Mortgage Company who helped me stay in my home, my husband passed away in XXXX. I have been current on my mortgage, I went to refinance my present mortgage and was devastated to find out I owed Bank of America XXXX! I was shocked and depressed over this and I am close to XXXX XXXX XXXX, Why wasn't I informed about this? Nothing was ever sent to me in the mail, why in the world wasn't this amount transferred to my new mortgage company?? I keep getting letters addressed to my late husband 's name, my name is no where on this letter, I am so confused and upset, I will never be relaxed about this hanging over my head, I am ashamed to tell my children, I called several places to no avail, if a Bank transfers your loan to a new servicer why would you not include this? A lot of people are telling me something is wrong somewhere when they transferred my loan to my new mortgage company, please look into this for me, I Truly believe that Bank of America charged me outrageous fees back then, please clear this up for me? My XXXX big question is if they transferred my old loan for XXXX which is what I owed Bank of America why do I owe a partial claim for XXXX? Something has to be wrong with my situation.Thank you for listening."
Mortgage,"Greetings to whomever is addressing this. I am  XXXX   XXXX  and back in the fall of  XXXX   (  probably between  XXXX  and  XXXX   ),  I sent a letter to our past President Obama regarding a previous home foreclosure my former spouse  XXXX   XXXX  and I encountered back in  XXXX   XXXX  via Bank  of America   (  BOA ). My family and I was directed to move out via a move out agreement which we complied with and vacated the property in  XXXX   XXXX  as we were instructed to do. Evidently President Obama got you all involved and a formal complaint was submitted. The foreclosure occurred as a result of my attempt to do a home loan recodification at that time. The complaint number is  XXXX  Hopefully you can retrieve the supporting documentation from there. But as I recall,  BOA  officials informed you that in fact there was no foreclosure in  XXXX  and they had tried to work with us to resolve the issue and that the actual foreclosure did n't occur until  XXXX   XXXX . Which was n't the case at all. Additionally I am a retired veteran. I served over 20 years in the  XXXX  and I had a VA loan at the time. I am also declared  XXXX  by the Department  of  VA and was at the time of the initial foreclosure in  XXXX   XXXX . While I did fall into somewhat of a financial crisis, I made an all out attempt to be proactive and apply for a loan modification in an effort to avoid foreclosure but to no avail. In  XXXX   XXXX  I was informed via phone call from a representative from the BOA that they were getting ready to foreclose was of the home in  XXXX   XXXX . I initially thought it was a joke and someone was trying to get over on me. Once I realized it was not a joke I informed them that I was instructed to vacate and I did as I was instructed and was currently living in an apartment and was under a lease agreement. I literally, was told to break the lease and just move back in the house that I previously had. My next question was, you expect me to break my lease after I was evicted due to a foreclosure. She informed me that I could either do that or try to short sale it or a deed in lieu. I informed her that I was confused about what was going on and I would get back with her. I then consulted and hired an attorney and took the case to court. Which was about the time you all got involved. However, the case ended up being thrown out of court based on the move out agreement from the initial foreclosure back in  XXXX . I appealed the initial ruling and the ruling was upheld at the district court level. I appealed that decision making  2  attempts to have my case reviewed at the Supreme Court level but it was n't picked up either time. That was a late as  XXXX   XXXX .   The court case is/ was  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  al. v. Bank  of America, N.A. ,  XXXX .  XXXX   XXXX .  XXXX  Here 's what concerns me. If I were to go rob a bank I would have committed a crime, a felony to be exact and would be facing time in prison and other forms of punishment. Yet the banks needed a bailout using tax payer funds and apart of the agreement was loan modifications and the criteria that was set in place for the bank bailout from the government using tax payer funds. As a tax payer I 'd like to know what real and legitimate methods of accountability were implied?   Also as a veteran I 'd like to know how many other veterans were affected by this horrific practice? Do n't they owe the VA back too?   It seems to me that with the government backing VA loans, if the banks foreclosed on a VA loan, they were reimbursed by the VA and still recouped from the actual resale of the hous e ( usu ally by auction ). Also did n't the banks use tax payer funds from the bailout as  one of the  means of funding the modification program/ requirements?   My questions/ concern are as follows : How is it that BOA can tell you al l one  thing to get you off their track and then go tell the court something totally different?   Is there no accountability?"
Mortgage,"XXXXIn XX/XX/XXXX I protested the value of my property that Bank of America gave me a mortgage for in XXXX. 
-The property value dropped from {$720000.00} to about {$670000.00}. 
-At about the same time, Bank of America notified me that my monthly amount went up because they were applying the escrow amount on {$720000.00}. 
-Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, automatic payments were made to Bank of America , but BOA rejected the payments because they did not match the escrow amount based on {$720000.00}. 
-Bank of America charged me late fees XXXX XXXX. 
-Bank of America misreported this activity to the Credit Bureaus, dropping my credit score 100 points. 

-XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America mailed me a LATE CHARGE REFUND check for XXXX XXXX!!! 

-Bank of America needs to UPDATE THE 4 CREDIT BUREAUS that I was not actually late on any payments."
Mortgage,"I am tired of the the way my loan is being handle by Bank of america. I submitted a new modification packet since the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX and today I called to make sure they have everything in. I was told they have not received anything I got very upset because I fax my documents to three different fax numbers so this would n't happened.the specialist provided me with another fax number. I told the Agent I  have an active sale date and is urgent for Bank of america to get my documents so a new review can start. I am very frustrated that I am doing everything I can to work with Bank of america so I can be provided a resolution. But I feel Bank of america is purposely prolonging the case so my home can finally foreclosed. I am making enough to be provided an affordable trial payment. My intentions are to keep my home. I will do whatever it takes to show Bank of america I want to be current once again. The previous trial payments was completed it 's showing I am able to afford my mortgage payments. The only thing that I did n't complete was the contribution I was being asked to pay {$6000.00} to bank of america. Those were funds I dont have available and I explain all of this to my specialist and still Bank of america refused to work with me. Now I was forced to reapply, and that is what I have done."
Mortgage,"Was denied a loan modification from bank of america for reasons that were false. The loan is an investor loan and bofa is just the servicer. The bank indicated that investor declined the loan, but the investor was never contacted because I spoke with the portfolio manager at XXXX the investor. I was again denied on appeal. Appointments were missed by bofa because they will contact me at a number that was not the best contact number. I gave the bank the best contact number but somehow the will chose to call a different number. Reasons for the modification was hardship due to a decrease in income and increase in the mortgage payment. Decrease in income caused by medical retirement. We just completed a 4 yr successful modification and we applied for a continuation because the hardship was still in effect and had gotten worse."
Mortgage,"In XXXX we were mandated by mortgage broker to take out new loan on house as prior mortgage company was going out of business. We went through process of moving loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ca to XXXX XXXX loans. We were current and one month ahead on payments to XXXX XXXX at the time that the loan was "" purportedly '' moved to XXXX XXXX Loans. XXXX put an escrow account on the loan which we did not need. We pay our own taxes and insurance since XXXX. We did NOT SIGN the loan papers to XXXX and called them to rescind the loan within 10 days of their recording the purported signed DEED and NOTE. We then continued to communicate with XXXX for 3 months, continued to make payments, but they wouldn ' t budge on the escrow account. We continued to make payments until XXXX, continued to try and rescind the loan through even an attorney, but they refused our Recission Letter. In XXXX we filed for Foreclosure mediation as our house was now XXXX under water. We went to mediation 4 times in XXXX and in XXXX XXXX an agreement was made for HAMP. little did we know that now XXXX XXXX XXXX had purchased XXXX. We made the agreed upon payments thru XXXX XXXX to a site in California until XXXX XXXX, but NEVER received any documents relating to payments credited and a new HAMP agreement as to the Mediation conclusion. We went back to our State lawyer to try and get a resolution again, but laws had changed again, and XXXX XXXX XXXX had sold our loan off to an unknown servicing company. We kept trying to get an accounting of the {$11000.00} we paid into HAMP. The new servicer XXXX XXXX did NOT FILE with the County Recorder as a Substitution Trustee or Servicer until XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, now this filing XX/XX/XXXX is 5yrs after we had already been in HAMP and thrown out of HAMP. IN XXXX XXXX, another servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, unrecorded until XXXX XXXX, XXXX, started foreclosure proceedings. This now has been going on since XXXX XXXX, XXXX yrs. We have fraudulent documents, TILA FRAUD, REGZ FRAUD, ROBOSIGNING, XXXX XXXX FRAUD, MAIL FRAUD, and are the at the FRONT LINE of Too Big to Fail, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and now Chain of Title unknown. 
We need help beyond just Mediation. I never signed the initial documents, the recorded documents do not have a real signature of mine, there was never a title company involved or a Notary Public at the Mortgage office. The purported person who had our papers was not licensed to sign any documents, nor was anyone other than myself and my wife at the purported signing of these fraudulent documents. Since XXXX I have made almost {$93000.00} in payments on a purported loan of {$190000.00} that escalated to {$240000.00} on the fraudulent paperwork to XXXX. 
I was under the impression that the bailout and payments to States in the agreed upon settlement was to benefit homeowners. HERE we now sit with another entity trying to foreclose on us. We are XXXX yrs old and my wife has lived here XXXX and paid the payments prior to the XXXX loan which I refinanced prior to XXXX and its friends in crime.

We need a Federal prosecutor to help us keep our house at its current value of {$90000.00}."
Mortgage,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America filed another report of missed payments with the credit bureaus regarding the account # XXXX which has been closed since XX/XX/XXXX. The bank correctly reported the closure of the account to the credit bureaus on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX following the sale of the property. However, the bank continues to file falsified claims of missed and late payments with the credit bureaus despite numerous promises to correct its records and ensure that all delinquencies are removed from my credit report. 

There was never a late or missed payment at any time during the existence of the mortgage."
Mortgage,"Please reference CFBP case # XXXX as well as this information. 

I had a BOA HELOC that was closed & charged off in XX/XX/2011. The last payment made on it was at least a year before that point. After case # XXXX however, BOA stopped reporting the "" Date of First Delinquency '' to the large credit reporting agencies. As a result, even though this account is now past the 7 years since it was last active mark, it has not been removed from my credit report per policy and Federal law.

I would ask that now this account has reached the 7 year mark from the DOFD, they take steps to have it removed entirely from credit report."
Mortgage,"over the past 2 years Bank of America has harassed m by misstating my requirement for a HARP loan and or modification by requesting the same documents which were sent and than stating they had aged over 90 days and requesting the same information multiple times and finally offering a modification which caused more hardship than relief. Seems as if they are simply not interested in the proper use of HARP funds entrusted to them to offer help. Late charges were overstated even though payments were not late as per the terms of the contract as well as escrow accounts being over stated even though we were trying to resolve the issues and there is no one to stand with me. In regard to checking accounts, transactions are manipulated to allow them to charge more fee. Larger amounts paid first so that account shows overdrawn and smaller amounts processed out of order and fees charged. Guess they need the money. I believe they are in violation of state and federal statutes relating to XXXX treatment. I was out of work for 4 months in 2015 for XXXX problems and suffered XXXX issues as a result of the XXXX over the actions of Bank of America. They have reported me to credit bureaus as being 4 months behind in mortgage payments even though I had tried many times to discuss the issues and communicated by phone and letter with no resolution other than continuing harassment. What to do??? I have tried to refinance with other companies but could not do so primarily due to alleged late mortgage paymnts."
Mortgage,"I have a home loan through Bank of America. My ex=husband and I were both originally on the deed. We were divorced through an uncontested divorce decree that was finalized in XXXX. Before the divorce, but after we separated, my husband and I entered a separation agreement, and we agreed that I would have the home. He signed and recorded a deed conveying any and all interest he had in the property to me, which was recorded in XXXX. He does not live in the home with me and has not since XXXX. 

After suffering an illness and missing work last year, I got behind on my mortgage ( I have since recovered from my hardship and my income has stabilized ). The property went into foreclosure, and I submitted a loss mitigation application to BOA in XXXX or XXXX XXXX requesting a loan modification. The loan was modified once previously, about 4 years ago, and is an FHA loan. 

XXXX XXXX, my customer service representative from BOA, contacted me last month and told me that in order to finalize my loan modification application, I would need a divorce decree from the court showing that I was awarded the home in the divorce. I explained to XXXX XXXX that it was an uncontested divorce and that the decree did not specify whom the home was awarded to, but that my husband had conveyed his interest to me. I provided XXXX XXXX with both the uncontested divorce decree and the deed from my ex-husband. XXXX XXXX responded by saying that the only thing BOA would accept would be the divorce decree she previously asked for ( which does not exist ). 

I contacted Legal Aid of North Carolina for help, and my attorney, XXXX XXXX, spoke with XXXX XXXX today. She confirmed that the only information she was missing to finalize the loan modification was the divorce decree. She verified that the reason BOA needed the divorce decree was to verify that the ex-husband no longer had an interest in the property. She acknowledged that I sent the deed to her as well as the uncontested divorce decree. She acknowledged that I informed her that the divorce decree BOA was asking for did not exist, but that unless I provided her with the decree BOA would not finalize the modification. She acknowledged that the sale date for the property is XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and that BOA was proceeding with the sale. She acknowledged that BOA accepted the deed as proof that my ex-husband did not have an interest in the property and allowed the prior modification to take place 4 years ago, but that the "" regulations have changed since then, '' and that the deed was no longer sufficient. My lawyer asked her to provide him with the regulation she was referring to, and she was not able to do so. He asked to speak with someone who had the authority to override that decision, and XXXX XXXX replied that there was no way to change the decision. He asked to speak with her supervisor. 

Her supervisor confirmed the information that XXXX XXXX told my lawyer and stated that it was a "" HUD requirement. '' She was also unable to provide my lawyer with any regulation or other authority, but said that she was told as much by their underwriter. My lawyer asked to speak with the underwriter 's manager, and she said he was not allowed to do that. 

I previously contacted HUD to complain about the situation, and I was assigned a HUD FHA National Service Worker. Her name is XXXX XXXX, and her number is XXXX. She assigned me a complaint number, which is XXXX. XXXX XXXX spoke with me yesterday and told me that the decree BOA was asking for was not a HUD requirement like BOA is saying. She said that BOA was likely looking for proof that my ex-husband does n't have any interest in the home. The deed is proof of that, and BOA has accepted it before. I do n't understand why BOA is giving me the run around now and shifting the blame to HUD, when HUD is not responsible."
Mortgage,"I have started refinance process with Bank of America in XX/XX/2017 whereas the sales agent promised me best rates and smooth process. As part of the process, they told me that they will carry out appraisal of my house and I need to pay upfront for it. I was not shared the amount that I need to pay for appraisal and was told that I will be refunded at the end when appraisal closes. I agreed to it as I didn't expect any issues in my loan process. During appraisal, an incorrect report came out which talks about an issue that I don't have in my home. I tried to explain to bank and appraisal company but they are not ready to correct the report resulting in my mortgage process going on hold. Bank has charged me for my appraisal fees but they didn't worked with appraisal company to correct the report even after I provided the reason for incorrectness of the report. My home ( in exactly same condition ) has gone through 3-4 appraisals before this appraisal but never such issue happened. I can provide more specifics when asked.

Mortgage,"Escrow Account Removal On XX/XX/XXXX after requesting escrow removal since XX/XX/XXXX, my account was returned to a normal standing without escrow. Attached please find the documentation from the bank stating the approval. However, only a few days later when I was preparing to make a morgage payment online, I noticed a negative balance of {$320.00} on my account. I immediately proceeded to contact BOA at XXXX and was advised that my HomeOwners Insurance Company billed. However, they failed to disclose that it was at their request. 

I contacted my insurance company where I received the fax they received from the bank dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) - just a day after the letter ( attached ) dated XX/XX/XXXX where escrow was already removed. The letter requested that the account be changed to "" mortgagee billed ), which resulted in the bank paying the balance on the policy. My policy was in good standing, my escrow had just been removed and there should have been no reason for this transaction to take place. 

I proceeded to immediately contact the bank and was advised to just repay the {$320.00} to the bank and no further issues would arise. I contacted my Account Manager ( XXXX ), but never a clear resolution to date. I requested an update as to why this occured to begin with and was told that I was approved for a "" Pre Trial for a Home Loan Modification '' something I was denied back in XX/XX/XXXX when initially applying and did not understand the reason for now being approved and advised I was not interested. 

A home loan specialist advised that I immediately send in a signed letter declining this offer that I never accepted, to prevent any other issues ( including escrow ). Attached you will find the letter faxed immediately on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received confirmation that I was no longer eligible for the "" Trial Period '' as I declined - hoping all would now return to normality. I in return made my payment to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX to satisfy the payment should have not made - but made anyhow on my behalf of {$320.00}. 

I continued to patiently wait for notification from my account manager that my account would not incur any escrow due to this bank error - yet no concrete resolution. My taxes then became due for XX/XX/XXXX and I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I in turn checked my online banking to find out the bank made a payment on XXXX. Another payment that should not have occurred ; which I was trying to avoid since XX/XX/XXXX. Attached you will find payment confirmation of payment made on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmation from the city portal that my taxes are paid as per my payment. 

I have tried to contact the customer service number with no luck as I am redirected to my account manager who I go a week at a time without being able to contact, I sent an email via the Bank of America portal to receive a response on my city taxes and escrow removal - and received the attached documents. This was a bank error that should never have taken place, I should not have an escrow account, my account in showing negative as a result of the city tax payment I was responsible for that I made on time to the city ( of which there is no way I will make another payment to the bank for a payment already made ). 

I am simply requesting that the bank correct the system error made on their end, whether that being departments not accurately touching base with one another, correspondence crossing, etc. Attached you will find my response to the bank sent today with attachments, of which I know will be disregarded due to this negative escrow they are showing which should not be in my account. I have tried to pursue all parties since I discovered the initial error with my homeowners insurance payment in XX/XX/XXXX - to avoid where we currently stand."
Mortgage,"I had decided to cancel my homeowners insurance with one company, and go with another company 2 months prior to the end date of the policy. I had gone to a local branch to inform of the change, and make sure the company that I was leaving would not be paid and the new one would be paid for the upcoming year renewal. The representative took down all the information, and stated that she would make sure the now old insurance company would n't be paid, and would only release a payment to the new insurance company. I received a notice this week to inform that both insurance companies have been paid in a total amount over {$2400.00}. After paying two different insurance company Bank of America ran an out-of-cycle escrow analysis report knowing that two insurance companies had been paid ; which will cause my mortgage payment to increase effective XX/XX/XXXX, 2018 close to {$200.00}. I have contacted the branch representative who stated that she had forgot to get the information over to the mortgage company, and it was my responsibility to contact the insurance company to get the refund back on a cancelled policy. I was informed by the insurance company that a refund could take up to 7 weeks. In the meantime, the mortgage company knowing that an error was made on there end will not remove the escrow analysis which will cause the mortgage payment to increase."
Mortgage,"In XXXX, we filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. In the bankruptcy we listed a house which had an FHA loan on it. The loan was serviced by Countrywide, who was purchased by Bank of America. We did not want to keep the property. The bankruptcy was approved, and our debts were discharged on XXXX. 

Since that time, the lender has refused to take the title to the house. We have made many attempts to sign over the deed. I have many notes of telephone calls, etc. They were not returned. This past year we even hired an attorney to contact BOA to facilitate signing over the deed. Her calls were not returned either. 

We have been told by several banks that we are unable to refinance our current mortgage or obtain a new one until this house is out of our name. Worse, we have been told that if the bank takes it by foreclosure, it will appear on our credit report as a new foreclosure, just as if a new financial crisis occurred instead of dating it back to XXXX. 

We believe that this situation is fundamentally unjust. We had to file for a bankruptcy due to a total XXXX. We are trying to get the fresh start which the bankruptcy laws are designed to provide. We have been managing our financial affairs quite well in the over six years that have past. How is it that Bank of America can be allowed to crush our future? 

We suspect that the whole problem is the FHA mortgage. As we understand it, when a borrower defaults, the US government steps in to make the mortgage payments. This continues as long as the house remains titled to the borrower. If the bank takes it back and sells it, the bank only receives a portion of any loss from the government. We understand that banks might or might not be the ultimate bondholders of the GNMA pool containing the mortgage. However a servicing fee is paid to the the bank. What inventive does Bank of America have to take back the title? From where we stand, they have no incentive. 

An interesting contrast is found with the other property we listed. That was not insured by the government. The lender with that mortgage took the title immediately, and sold it. The entire matter was complete within six months of discharge. 

We are asking the CFPB to investigate why this is taken so long, especially given the heavy documentation of our willingness to sign the deed over. Further we want the CFPB to insist that our credit not be harmed any further"

Bank of America confirmed they received my application in XXXX 2016. My attorney worked with them to get them all the requested documents for a complete financial package by early XXXX 2016. While I was in the review process, Bank of America mailed me an automatic Streamline Modification offer ( dated XXXX/XXXX/16 ; attached ). My attorney advised Bank of America that I was not interested in the Streamline Modification program because it has a higher payment than the HAMP program. My attorney repeatedly asked Bank of America to remove the Streamline Modification offer because I wanted to be reviewed for the HAMP modification program instead. Bank of America repeatedly told my attorney that they would review my loan for the HAMP program. Thus far they have NOT reviewed me for the HAMP program. They keep sending me letters trying to get me to accept the ( WORSE with a higher payment ) Streamline Mod offer. Now my attorney recently followed up with Bank of America and they state there is no review open any longer. Basically they cancelled my HAMP review because they are trying to force me to take the Streamline Modification offer that has a much higher payment than the HAMP program. Now the HAMP program has expired and Bank of America evaded reviewing me for the requested HAMP program. I know they had a complete file because they approved me for a modification on my 2nd mortgage. I do no think it was right for Bank of America to evade reviewing me for HAMP solely because their system had already approved me for a worse higher payment ( Streamline Mod ). My application was in before HAMP expired and Bank of American should not be able to evade reviewing me solely becuase they want me to take a worse program ( Streamline Mod )."

Overstating the monthly escrow payment by {$1000.00} ( {$170.00} for 6 months ) by including the cost of hazard insurance purchased by the homeowner of {$2100.00} out of pocket and failing to deduct the amount already paid. In essence forcing the homeowner to pay a 2nd time to escrow for the same policy by the XXXX service provider. 

Based on the actions of the XXXX service provider as outlined above which transferred a - {$350.00} escrow balance to the XXXX service provider when the balance should have been {$5300.00} The XXXX service provider believing the handling and accounting by the XXXX service provider was accurate at - {$350.00}, added an additional {$3100.00} to escrow to cover the deficiency in the escrow balance making the escrow account further in the negative and again increase the monthly cost of escrow payments. 

{$2000.00} paid to the XXXX service provider in XXXX XXXX was held in "" suspense '' and not included in the accounting of my mortgage, escrow, and interest calculations as reported on federal tax forms for interest paid during XXXX. 

For just the items noted above, this amounts to {$12000.00} ( represents & gt ; XXXX mostly mortgage and escrow payments ) that I was stolen and misappropriated from me to meet the obligations of this home loan. 

As such, XXXX has filed a foreclosure suite which I am challenging in a countersuit citing numerous violations under XXXX, and violations of Florida XXXX XXXX False reports, etc., by officers of banks, trust companies, etc., with intent to defraud. And Florida Statutes XXXX Grand Theft which "" deprived counterplaintiff XXXX XXXX ) of the funds designated for escrow for their intended purpose. 

I have file records request with the court on XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX, XXXX ; and XXXX, XXXX to review all records pertaining to my account with no records being produced by XXXX or either of the XXXX service providers. The XXXX, XXXX request did come back with a statement that all records were privileged, and that my record request was nothing more that a fishing exercise. 

My rebuttal is that there are the records of how the funds were spent on my behalf through my mortgage and escrow payments, and how funds were disbursed from the permanent loan modification paid on my behalf through the making home affordable program.

Mortgage,"Bank of America misappropriated 2 months of XXXX of my properties/mortgage payments when they bought Countrywide. Ultimately, with the help from an attorney, the properties came out of default, my credit was cleared, or so I thought, and this was in 2010. Now, I 'm getting ready to refinance the XXXX properties in which I finally have equity, and the exact language on my credit report shows the following language : "" Status/Details : This item was updated from our processing of your dispute in XXXX 2010. '' Of course, the new lender wants this off my credit report. So I called Bank of America who told me to write a letter, which I did, requesting them to have the credit agencies delete that language. I followed up with a phone call, indicated by the person I spoke to on the phone. He told me that the address I send the letter to ( overnight mail ) does n't have any phones, so I ca n't call them to follow up in XXXX XXXX. He ( XXXX ) is located in XXXX Arizona. I asked him ; "" what can I do? '' He told me ... .you got it, "" send a letter to the address in XXXX XXXX XXXX '' I told him I already did, and he then proceeded to tell me they 'll have to research it, and that this could take between 28 and 30 days ; which I do n't have. 
So, my question to you is : If Bank of America is requiring I pay everything on time, which I do, did, and would continue, how come they are n't available EVER to answer my request. 
I can not tell you how incredibly frustrating this is. I hope they all go under in my life time. Sick of banks and the power they hold over small, really good consumers like me.

After returning the modification paperwork and 6 months to 1 year of making the trial payments BofA finally place me back in a normal status. Some months later I noticed my mortgage wasn't on my credit report, I promptly called BofA and was told by their Mortgage Lending Department that they were obligated to report because I didn't fill out and sign a form guaranteeing my loan. I told them that wasn't fair because I signed EVERYTHING they sent. They responded by telling me I could refinance the house and then and only then would they provide me with the document necessary obligating them to report my mortgage."

Bank of America latest loan servicer - XXXX XXXX XXXX now say that the information is not available.

Mortgage,"To whom it may concern : I bought my home on XX/XX/XXXX. The seller had a payoff with First Franklin Financial Corp which was collected on the XXXX at the closing. Fast forward to today. I am now selling my home and it is under contract and our closing date was XX/XX/XXXX, however has been prevented due to this issue. The current title company has been trying to get a lien release from the previous mortgage company and or a cancelled check from the previous closing title company XXXX XXXX XXXX law firm ( XXXX XXXX ) in XXXX Ky. The law firm refuses to give the cancelled check that is proof the loan was paid off and the mortgage company refuses to send a lien release. Here is the problem : First Franklin Financial CorpXXXX no longer exists which was the previous sellers mortgage company, Bank of America now owns First Franklin. I need to get this resolved in order to close on the sale of my home. 

First Franklin Financial Corp., a subsidiary of XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX Loan No. XXXX. ( There is a XXXX at the end, but I do not believe this is a part of the loan number. ) Bank of America phone number is XXXX, with reference number XXXX. 

Please note we do not have a Bank of America account number. 

This is added information to the prior complaint that I have filed on XX/XX/XXXX"
Mortgage,"I took out a mortgage with Bank of America in XXXX of XXXX  Because I hold my primary bank accounts ( savings and checking ) with Bank of America, it should be easy and seamless to withdraw the funds from my bank account to pay my mortgage account. A representative at the bank helped me set up my mortgage account in XXXX  to do this. 

However, it has been confirmed for me, just within the last couple of weeks, that the payments were set up incorrectly in XXXX and, when my escrow recently increased, the payments the bank has been withdrawing have been less than my new mortgage payment. I noticed that I had a small overdue balance months ago and called the bank only to be told that it was set up to 'correct itself ' and I did not need to take any action. I paid this no further attention because, again, my payments are set up to be taken automatically from the bank. However, I recently started receiving phone calls that I was behind on my mortgage payments. 

So I called the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and the representative confirmed that my mortgage account was set up incorrectly by the bank in XXXX. Specifically, my payments were set up to be made through automatic "" Bill Pay '' rather than a "" Pay Plan ''. I was never advised of this, even though I asked the question multiple times. The representative waived most of the late fees the bank assessed but noted that there was an additional {$47.00} that the system would not allow him to process since it was a "" partial fee ''. He instructed me to call mortgage customer service to have this fee waiver processed. As for correcting future payments, the bank 's system will not allow me to set up the proper "" Pay Plan '' going forward until this is reconciled. 

I called mortgage customer service on XX/XX/XXXX as instructed. I was on the phone for XXXX minutes explaining the situation to 3 different representatives only to be told that their system would not allow them to process the waiver since the issue goes back further than 12 months. I was told a supervisor would contact me. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again since I did not receive the promised call from the supervisor at the bank. I was told this time that there is no way they can waive the fee because their systems don't allow it. 

So, in summary, Bank of America set up my mortgage account incorrectly, told me it was correct when I inquired about it, withdrew insufficient funds from my banking account, charged me late fees as a result of their error, and made my ability to set up future payments contingent on paying these fees ( or else incurring additional late fees ). All of my conversations with the bank are documented in my file with them. The difference is less than {$50.00} but, on principle, I should not be expected to pay for this. I, again, am requesting that the bank process a waiver for the remaining {$46.00} so that I can they set up my "" Pay Plan '' properly going forward. Also, their reps should be trained on this process so this does not happen to other customers, assuming this was a mistake and not a sanctioned process within the bank for more fraudulent purposes."
Mortgage,"I listed my home for sale in 2012, and had a HELOC with Bank of America. Since I moved out of the property and had issues selling the home, I fell behind on my payments and opted for loan modification/short sale/deed-in-lieu options. I repeatedly filled out forms, supplied the necessary supporting financial documents, and B of A did not respond. When I finally was able to secure a buyer for a short sale, I again filled out the forms, and B of A persisted in being uncooperative and would not approve the sale. 
This continued repeatedly for several years, as no less than three qualified prospective buyers came and went, eventually giving up and withdrawing their bids due to B of A 's delays. My RE seller agent even contacted our local representative for assistance but to no avail. Eventually, the RE company no longer wanted to represent the sale because of the issues incurred by B of A. Even when a RE investment company offered to purchase the deed, B of A would not allow the deed transfer and now the matter is going to court. Meanwhile, there is a lis pendens on my property and I am now facing foreclosure and damage to my credit. All this could have been avoided had Bank of America not led me to believe that there were actually alternatives to foreclosure as they stated in several mailings."
Mortgage,"More than a year ago, my home ( which was an investment property was seized by the Board of Directors in a Lawsuit and Fraud was in question when the Board and the Management Company imposed a XXXX assessment on a 30 unit condo building in which I owned and rented one of the units. I currently have a lawsuit for malpractice against the attorney who handled my case. 
I have no idea who is living in my condo, and it appears that the Board and the Management Company has extended their stay. 
I contacted Bank of America 's Loss Mitigation department, and the Bank refuses to initiate any type of investigation. 
The Bank is neglecting to foreclose so I can get my home off my credit report, and is charging me monthly thousands of dollars to pay a mortgage when I wanted a Mitigation Loss investigator, and my home has been in foreclosure for more than a year. I have made this request several times and the bank refuses to investigate."
Mortgage,"I purchased a house in Massachusetts back in XXXX with Countrywide Bank in the amount of $ XXXX. In XXXX I could not afford my mortgage payments and the bank initiate a short sale process in my primary house. I tried to negotiate with BOA but the Bank did not want to make a fair agreement. My house was sold to a 3rd party for a half of the amount owed to BOA. 
Bank of America owned both mortgage by then. The house was sold in XXXX. In my perspective both loans will be cover by the sale. BOA never informed myself that I could have a deficient judgement against me. Few weeks a go a collection name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX contact me trying to collect an AMOUNT OF {$61000.00} saying that Bank of America transfer my 2nd Mortgage to them in XXXX XXXX. At this point the house was not even sold and I was living in the house. 
My complaint is : How come BOA sold this loan to a collection before the house was sold? 
Unfortunately I did not had any legal support in order to give me and my family orientation in regarding to remained balances of this mortgage. 
How came they want to came after myself with both loans was done when the house was purchased. 
Please help me to solve this situation. If this is true I would need to file for bankruptcy since I do not have the funds to pay."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/2023 - Without notification, my mortgage loan was transferred from Bank of America to XXXX XXXX DBA XXXXXXXX XXXX 

XX/XX/2023 - I called first Bank of America to find out why my balance was not available on the automated system. They informed me my loan was sold to "" XXXX XXXX '' and gave me their contact number as XXXX. I then contacted the number given and was told not to pay Bank of America that day since the XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) representative said, "" sometimes the payments have trouble getting to us. '' I opted to delay my XX/XX/XXXX payment to allow the "" 5 business days '' she said it would take for my account to come up in their system. She also gave me a website to check to see if my loan had been transferred yet, XXXX XXXX XXXX Because of other judgments against XXXX XXXX, including misappropriation of funds, missed tax payments from escrow, and the fines they currently owe, I checked into getting my mortgage refinanced through several channels. Currently, federal regulations do not allow for a refinance due to the current rates and balance still owed on my mortgage. It was taken out recently when rates were low, so it is reasonable to assume Bank of America sold it off to invest in something with a higher return. 

XX/XX/2023 - I tried the website to see if it recognized my information. It did not, so I called Bank of America to see if there was another "" loan number '' associated with the account. The representative told me that XXXX XXXX should still be able to take a payment and asked me to call them. I did so, and when I did the woman said that the loan was still not in the system. I asked to speak to her supervisor, who, when I demanded, gave me a payment address of "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX. '' When I asked if she could then guarantee that payments I sent to that address would be credited to my account, she said, "" I can not guarantee that. '' I then told her that I must make a payment to someone now, or the payment will not be received by XX/XX/XXXX, and I was opting to pay Bank of America instead because they had received my payments and had credited them successfully. I then called Bank of America and reported my payment made to them through my bank 's bill pay system, and gave the date they should receive said payment as XX/XX/2023. 

I have a few questions : - Why is XXXX XXXX still allowed to do business if they have several judgments against them for fraud? 
- Why is Bank of America allowed to sell my loan servicing to an entity with such a sordid past? 
- If XXXX XXXX has a payment address, why can't they receive, and credit, payments sent to that address? 
- Why, when they said it would take 5 business days to transfer the loan, has it taken more than 6 business days, and it still is not transferred? 
- Why was the loan sold on XX/XX/XXXX, which is a Saturday? 

I'd like an answer to these questions, however, I realize some of them may have no answer. 

I ask the transfer from Bank of America to XXXX XXXX DBA XXXX XXXX be terminated and made of null effect, leaving the servicing of my mortgage in the hands of Bank of America. I think this is a reasonable request considering the number of legal judgments against XXXX XXXX DBA XXXXXXXX XXXX  has against them."
Mortgage,"This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application.

Moreconfirmation of the aforesaid item too.

I just do n't have that kind of money. So I asked that a denial letter be sent to me or my attorney. I 've received everything from "" XXXX '' but the denial letter. In fact I just received another letter from "" XXXX '' offering help AGAIN. The new offer came with a notice from the court informing me that my house will be auctioned in a few days. Nice strategy from BOA and XXXX XXXX XXXX, but I am still waiting for the denial letter. I wonder why I still do n't receive it ... I guess it got stuck in traffic. Helping me keep my house is not in the bank interest. It 's more profitable to sell the property. These guys were bailed out by the government. They should return the same favor to desperate homeowners. I am not asking for a free house.I have a steady job. All I asked is an affordable payment plan. But it 's impossible for BOA and XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide such help. BECAUSE I COULD NOT COME UP WITH {$56000.00}."
Mortgage,"I have been XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX, and purchased my home after my divorce in XX/XX/XXXX. Due to special needs and ongoing medical expenses, I knew my mortgage payment was more that I could afford, so I contacted Bank of America to see what we could do. They sent me forms by fedex, and I filled them out, but I could never get past that point and reaching the person handling the service on my loan was a series of phone tag. I filed for Chapter XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, but this did n't change my monthly outlay of expenses. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was approved for Social Security XXXX, but this caused my private XXXX company to stop paying my benefits. My income has been reduced by more than XXXX % since XXXX XXXX. I filed a consumer complaint about my mortgage, and Bank of America wanted me to file for the hardest hit fund first. I did this, was approved and gave Bank of America the same paperwork to rework my mortgage. I was given the email address of the person handling my loan and submitted documents requested, but the only response I received was a letter they were still waiting on missing documents and they closed my request. The hardest hit fund pays my home loan for 13 months from XXXX XXXX, but I will need my loan to be modified in order to keep my home. I believe I qualify and I need Bank of America to complete the process. I am a full-time single parent with XXXX.

When I called they did not give me an answer. Just that I needed to sign. I explain that 4 months ago I had completed the process and have been making my payments on time. After several weeks of going back and forth, they admitted that there was a miscalculation in my loan, but no explanation as to the mistake. I told them that I would not sign new documents as I already have a signed loan agreement with them. What 's to say, if I sign, that they wo n't come back again in 5 months and ask to change them again. I continue to make my payments in a timely matter. They continue to call and tell me to sign or they will withdraw the modification. I have a legal agreement with them. I need help to get them to stand by the original loan documents."

Over the past 5 months we were also told that we did not have to apply for a modification and there is no needed for a modification since the bank would automatically place any missing payments on the backend of the mortgage loan and the loan would be extended automaically.

Mortgage,"XXXX - I initiated a home loan through Countrywide Home Loans ( now defunct, some top CEOs prosecuted ) XXXX - I sought a HELOC ( "" second mortgage '' ) through Countrywide. There was no onsite appraisal of my home. The agent told me, based on "" comparables '' for my area, my home was "" worth over {$300000.00} ''. I told the CHL agent that mine was the only home in my area less than XXXX square feet, and that I had only paid {$200000.00} for it. The agent insisted my home value had already increased dramatically ( despite the "" real-estate slump '' that had been apparent since XXXX ). I accepted a loan amount of {$46000.00}, based on what the agent told me about my home - even though the amount I had originally asked for was only {$25000.00}. XXXX - Immediately after I realized I had been "" scammed '' by Countrywide ( I spoke with a realtor about my home 's approximate value - around {$190000.00} she said ), I attempted to contact Countrywide, but they were already under investigation and no one returned my calls. XXXX - I received notice from Bank of America that it had purchased Countrywide 's loans. I explained how Countrywide had inflated my loan amount, based on false valuation of my home. B of A was totally unsympathetic. One agent remarked, "" Well, at least they ( Countrywide ) all went to jail! '' I continued to press B of A for some kind of relief ( reduction of the overall loan debt was what I sought ), but the bank "" stonewalled '' me and implied that the whole situation was my fault. XXXX - I received notice from Bank of America that XXXX XXXX now "" owned '' my loan, and that - if I wanted to continue to pursue this issue -- I would need to contact XXXX. I contacted XXXX and explained my complaint. XXXX agents told me that B of A still owned the loan, but XXXX only "" serivced '' the loan. Frustrated, I gave up my quest for resolution - which I know is what B of A wanted. XXXX -- I received notice from XXXX that XXXX now held my loan. I did not pursue this situation with XXXX. I was convinced I would not make any progress. [ SidXXXX note : I consulted an attorney when Bank of America still held clear ownership of my second mortgage. I wanted to know what could be done. The attorney laughed and referred to the "" deep pockets '' of Bank of America. The attorney told me I had an excellent claim of fraudulent business practices against Countrywide - which Bank of America had assumed, when it bought my loan -- but I would literally become bankrupted if I tried to sue B of A. XXXX -- in XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from Bank of America that my loan had now come "" full circle '' : back under the ownership of the original financial institution that bought all of Countrywide 's mortgages, Bank of America. For 10 years and in good faith, I have made payments on a loan that should NEVER have been processed, even according to agents of Bank of America. I am a single parent, now retired, a son in college and back in college myself. I feel that, having whittled this fraudulent loan from {$46000.00} down to roughly {$23000.00}, Bank of America should ( finally ) acknowledge the fraud it assumed from Countrywide and eliminate the remaining debt. Tossing my loan from company to company finds it now back with Bank of America. Their statement to me ( when the loan went to XXXX ) was that - while they acknowledged the fraud committed by Countrywide -- there was nothing that could be done ... they no longer owned the loan. Now they do - once again. They can, and should, fix this 10 year old scam."

When I became aware of this in XXXX I called the mortgage department of the bank and we clarified all information regarding mailing address and phone numbers. I was promised another check, which I have never received. Again in XXXX I called and spoke with the mortgage department we again verified all information and I was promised another check. Each time I was told they issued a stop payment and issued a new check. Again it was not received. After a couple of weeks I called again in XXXX and we went through the same process which ended in the same result. I called again XX/XX/2019, spoke with a supervisor and was promised a replacement check via overnight delivery and a phone call with a tracking number to be able to track the delivery. I did not receive either. I called again XX/XX/2019 to inquire about the overnight delivery. Again I spoke with a Supervisor, and after spending 40 minutes on the phone most of the time waiting I hung up and decided to complain. To date, XX/XX/2019 this issue has not been resolved. Each of these phone calls have taken at least 30 minutes of my time with no results and Bank of America holding on to {$760.00} for approximately 3 months. 

If you are able please resolve this for me."
Mortgage,"I have, in the past, applied for mortgage modifications with Bank of America On numerous occasions since XXXX only to be denied. I recently paid close to 12k in cash in approximately XXXX of this year to pay down my balance and have a final balance of {$3400.00}. I have missed XXXX and XXXX payments due to unexpectedly replacing my roof and emergency repairs to my heating system. My tenant also broke a lease unexpectedly and moved in XXXX. I have called Bank of America and  requested a workout plan k my to again be denied so that they can push me into foreclosure and attempt to take my home for a mortgage balance of less than {$4000.00}. They refuse to provide phone numbers for the Presidents office to provide assistance and allude to the fact that they can start foreclosure proceedi vs at any time over a {$3400.00} balance. I have assured them I can make full payment of my regular mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX if the government does not shut down as I am a government employee which wou.d reduce my mortgage balance to under {$3000.00} but XXXX and Supervisor XXXX Had an said adamtly no there is nothing they can do. BOA has repeatedly denied my modification requests in the past by saying my income is insufficient but it strange that I have made my mortgage payments in excess of 23 years as well as paid them a lump sum of {$12000.00} towards the principle in XXXX/XXXX of this year. This proves outright that BOA is consistently trying to take my home to profit from it and offering no assistance on a {$3300.00} mortgage balance that would be paid off over a period of maybe 3 months. I believe they are committing consumer fraud by not acting in good faith."
Mortgage,"Forty-five mortgage payments I made to Bank Of America starting in XX/XX/XXXX and continuing until XX/XX/XXXX were not credited to my mortgage until XX/XX/XXXX. Total this was almost {$17000.00}. BOA continued to charge me interest on money that I had paid to them for 4.5 years.They finally applied my payments in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have asked BOA what they were doing with my money between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The only response I have gotten from them is that they did apply the payments in XX/XX/XXXX.

I am aware that they applied these payments in XX/XX/XXXX, but I made the payments several years earlier. 
My question continues to be why didn't they credit my account when I made the payment instead of waiting over four years?"
Mortgage,"I placed an offer on a house and contacted Bank of America loan officer that gave me a preapproval when i started looking. i asked where to begin told me the rates over the phone i asked for a Loan Estimate so i could verify it was the best deal. his tone changed and he told me my loan was hard due to a foreclosure in the past and other banks would have a hard time. I said ok i still wanted the Loan Estimate. he sent me a closing cost worksheet. i asked if this was the loan estimate he said yes, then i sent an email back saying even his document said it was n't at the top. The loan officer insisted that I send the contract over to him for the Loan Estimate. I referred him to the CFPB site and saying i did not need to send that information to him with what i need to give him. he brushed it off and requested the contract again. he still has not given me the loan estimate and continues to ask for the contract. when i informed him that according to the CFPB site i should not give him the information and if he continued I would complain to the CFPB and let them sort it out. he responded saying he wanted the contract for the property address and closing date and not to threaten him. so now I 'm letting the CFPB take care of it."
Mortgage,"I requested Proof of Claim, and I paid the amount in full.They did not reply. I requested for a notice for Paid in Full.They did not reply. I dont owe nothing and I have paid it all off."
Mortgage,"BANK OF AMERICA has incorrectly reported the status of my mortgage, since XX/XX/XXXX, to the credit reporting agencies. A "" DISPUTE '' dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was submitted to BANK OF AMERICA recently. BANK OF AMERICA letter, dated : XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with regard to my Mortgage Account No. : XXXX, stated : '' ... We 've completed a review of our records and have confirmed the information we provided to the CRA is accurate. '' Since their reply is not true, I wish to file a complaint against BANK OF AMERICA with the CFPB."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX we paid off our Bank of America HELOC loan. 

Based on our payoff statement we were charged {$540.00} in interest through XX/XX/XXXX. We paid off the loan early on XX/XX/XXXX. A Bank of America representative explained to us any overage would be prorated and refunded to us within 20 business days of the payoff date. We calculate the amount of interest overpaid as follows : 26 days ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) x $ XXXX/day interest = {$440.00} credit due We have spoken to Bank of America on five separate occasions each time being put on hold for over 30 minutes at a time and being given varying explanations for why we haven't received our overage. They have never called us back, we've had to contact them each time and each time they have a different reason for why we need to call back, email them information they already have regarding our account, speak to a different department, etc. 

It has been the single worst banking experience we have ever had and we would never do business with BOA again or recommend them to others."
Mortgage,"My home was forclosed on in XX/XX/XXXX, 2017. I had been working with BOA for months to do cash for keys or a shortsale, or even a modification. I went to an on location mobile help site set up by BOA to sit down and speak with a loan counselor and they were not able to assist me because the loan was FHA. ( this was not stated in the letter advising us that they had on site help ). I kept in touch with my siingle POC but they changed often sometimes even twice a month. I submitted all of my paperwork when they requested and was in contact with them up until the day of the sale. The rep stated they had had my paper work prior and was reviewing it. They said to me that they could postpone the sale and did not. I lost me home and because of that me my son and my grandchildren were homeless. I asked the rep what happened why couldnt they postpone the sale she stated it was a "" mistake ''. 
I did every thing they asked of me, over and over again, package after package and they did not keep up their end. I understand that I signed a contracual agreement and BOA agreed to work with me and did not uphold thier end. As a result, we were homeless for the 1st time in my life, it is tramatic experience for me and my family, and it affected my health."
Mortgage,"Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX We started the short sale process with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. We faxed in our authorization, Hardship Letter, XXXX Cert for XXXX XXXX and the POA for XXXX XXXX giving Power of attorney to XXXX XXXX. ( See the attached documents that BAC has received over the course of the past year. ) Since then we have been informed that the loan has been charged off. In turn we asked that we receive either a payoff demand showing the balance due, if any ; OR a Reconveyence of the 2nd TD. We have requested these in our multiple conversations -- -10 separate conversations -- - with Bank of America which have taken place on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( at which time Bank of America told us they no longer had the loan -which was not true ), XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 

In almost every conversation I was directed either to a different department ( who then told me that dont actually have the loan either ) or I was given a number to fax in the authorizations and POAs YET AGAIN. 

In my conversation with Bank of America today I was told that Bank of America would need further documents in order to move forward with our requests for a payoff. ( Please see # 4 below ) In this process Bank of America has delayed processing the request for a payoff demand. Instead, they have done several other things : 1. Demanded a different power of attorney WHICH IS A FELONY  -as it is a violation of Elder Abuse laws. 
2. Required the borrower to sign all documents for the short sale herself WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF BOTH POWERS OF ATTORNEY WHICH ARE ALREADY IN PLACE -- not only the Power of Attorney that was in place prior to the start of the short sale, but also a violation of the power of attorney that BAC demanded the borrower sign. If they are claiming the borrowers signature must be in ink on the Bank of America documents then why did they demand another different POA to be signed??? 
3. Required the payoff statement from the 1st TD - the 1st TD payoff has NOTHING TO DO WITH PROCESSING A REQUEST FOR THE 2ND TD -- -- -- UNLESS THERE IS FRAUD GOING ON -- -??????? 
4. Required documents for a short sale before providing a payoff demand. -- - These two things have NOTHING to do with one another SHORT SALE DOCUEMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PROCESS A PAYOFF DEMAND REQUEST. 
5. Bank of America has acknowledged our authorization yet refused to allow me to speak to someone that actually handles these types of loans. -- - You CAN NOT REFUSE TO SPEAK WITH AN AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY. 



At this point Bank of America has acknowledged my authorization as an agent for XXXX XXXX XXXX. They have also told us in writing that the loan is charged off.  THEREFORE -- -- -- -- Bank of America has TWO options EITHER provide a payoff demand to me as the authorized third party -- - OR Reconvey the lien off the property. But THESE DELAY TACTICS AND PHONE GAMES HAVE TO STOP. It is obvious Bank of America is either completely incompetent in dealing with these types of loans AND THIS IS PURPOSEFUL FRAUD ON THEIR PART."
Mortgage,"I completed the logon process to my Bank of America account and proceeded to pay additional principal on my mortgage. The only option available to me was to pay the next mortgage payment plus a maximum of {$5000.00} additional principal. Bank of America applied the payment on XX/XX/2022 and charged me full interest as if it was paid on the normal due date of XX/XX/2022. This is deceptive to say the least. This mortgage will be paid off well before XX/XX/2022. I wonder how many people have been overcharged as a result of this? I would expect this to be illegal. If it is not, it should be! An audit should be performed, and Bank of America should be forced to refund any interest it overcharged mortgage customers with their fraudulent website. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Mortgage,"I have a home loan with Bank of America Loan # XXXX. I have been unemployed since XXXX XXXX, XXXX and on XXXX XXXX, XXXX fell behind on my payments. I contacted Bank of America in the XX/XX/XXXX to let them know that I may fall behind in the near future and was n't sure I would be able to pay for XXXX. I had contacted HOPE and based on the information I gave them the counselor said that I qualified for an unemployment forbearance. When I spoke to Bank of America the account manager I spoke with said "" we can not help you because you do not have income coming in. I will send you a loan modification packet because we by law have to send it. '' I filled the paperwork out but they have been dragging their feet and not giving me an answer when they already said they could n't help me. I feel they are stalling so that my house will go into foreclosure so that they will have to do a short sale of the property. I am in the process of putting my house on the market because I feel that Bank of America is not willing to work with me on programs I may qualify for. I feel they are purposely stalling the process when they are going to deny me help anyway so that they can profit from this. I only have {$3100.00} to my very name and need money to survive until I can find employment. They are fully aware of my situation and finances due to the modification paperwork I filled out and even though they know how desperate my financial situation is, they are refusing to look out my best interest because they are a business and looking out for themselves. I would like to be able to make a profit from my home in order to stay afloat. Bank of America truly needs to work with homeowners who especially want to remain in their homes and who like me have NEVER missed or been late on a payment. I would like for them to stop the deceptive practices and value their customers more instead of always looking out for themselves. I personally want them to understand and work with me to gain a profit due to my situation. We make their business and I have informed them that I am going to get on social media and let everyone know what type of bank they are and that they care nothing about customers but their bottom line.

Mortgage,"Loan Servicing ( intimidation to refinance with mortgage institution ). 
Last week, I called Bank of America in an attempt to understand my options, due to my Home Equity Line of Credit, turning into a balloon payment in XXXX 2016. At the time, I informed the customer service representative about competition in the market place and I requested their best rate, as my bank ( not BoA ), has mailed me a formidable offer for my home equity line of credit. The agent treated me with disrespect, therefore I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor continued this treated. In addition, the supervisor informed me the value of my home has decreased. I responded that I have obtained a recent Appraisal from a Virginia Licensed Appraiser and his information is inaccurate. Also, I only asked about my options with regard to the balloon payment, never did I request a change of my loan or to apply for a new loan. 
Seven days later I received a letter from Bank of America which suspends my Home Equity line of credit, due to the decreased value. Also in this letter, is evidence that BoA checked my credit and made a consumer decision denying my loan ( I never authorized them to check my credit, nor did I apply for a loan ). It is important to note, we have never missed a payment. Also, on a recorded message while on hold, BoA records customer calls. I welcome your monitoring these conversations."
Mortgage,"This is in reference to case XXXX.Bank of America responded with answers to questions I did not ask. They also said in there response letter, they did n't have enough factual detail for them to research appropriately, so I will restate my concerns several times. 
My concerns are : ( a. ) about monies ( escrow checks ) that were re-deposited into mortgage loan account and not accounted for and, ( b ) while with COUNTRYWIDE no record of proof for my PMI payments therefore the application of PMI on this loan far too long.

Mortgage,"Broken Dreams : The Cost of False Advertising on the American Dream Introduction : In a heartwarming quest to fulfill the American dream of homeownership, our protagonist, a non-XXXX XXXX  on an XXXX XXXX, encountered a shining beacon of hope : Bank of America 's ( BoA ) Affordable Loan Solution Program. The allure of receiving a {$10000.00} down payment grant and having all closing costs covered seemed too good to be true. Little did our hopeful homebuyer know that this journey would soon become a nightmare due to the consequences of false advertising.

False Hope and Broken Promises : Excitement and anticipation filled the air as our protagonist reached out to BoA 's lending specialist. The specialist, with apparent confidence, confirmed that our hero was eligible for the program with their F-1 visa status, seemingly thorough in her research. Thrilled by this news, they plunged headlong into the dream, investing time, effort, and emotions into their pursuit of a new home.

Deceptive Courses of Action : To ensure their eligibility, our protagonist took no chances and inquired repeatedly, even before investing in a homebuyer 's course. Each time, the BoA specialist reassured them that they were indeed eligible, further solidifying their belief in this seemingly golden opportunity. The joy of securing a home and making cherished memories was almost within grasp, or so they thought.

The Devastating Reveal : As the closing date approached and our protagonist had invested significant out-of-pocket expenses, a devastating blow was dealt. BoA suddenly denied their loan application, solely based on their immigration status. The foundation of their dreams crumbled beneath them, leaving them emotionally shattered, financially drained, and with their trust in the system shaken.

Reckoning and Seeking Justice : The aftermath was filled with anguish, disappointment, and broken promises. Our hero 's mental health suffered, their finances depleted, and relationships strained. Their real estate agent, seller, friends, and family witnessed the toll this deceitful marketing campaign had taken on them. A once-thriving life was left in disarray, and the future they had envisioned seemed out of reach.

The Call for Accountability : It is clear that Bank of America 's failure to train their employees about the consequences of false advertising, negligent marketing practices, and unfair product promotion led to this heartbreaking outcome. Our protagonist was misled, and the emotional and financial wreckage they endured demands accountability.

Seeking Reparation : In light of the damage caused by BoA 's false advertising, our hero seeks justice and a rightful repair for the physical, emotional, social, and financial toll they endured. The request for {$95000.00} in damage repair represents the pain they endured in the pursuit of their American dream. Furthermore, they demand that BoA take proactive measures to prevent others from enduring a similar ordeal. An orientation program for employees, focusing on educating them about the intricacies of non-resident aliens and immigration, could help prevent future cases of false advertising and negligence and might avoid a future class action.

Conclusion : The story of our protagonist serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of ethical marketing practices, transparency, and accountability in the financial industry. False advertising can crush dreams, leaving individuals scarred and struggling to rebuild their lives. Let this tale of broken dreams and shattered hope stand as a plea for businesses to act responsibly and honestly, safeguarding the dreams and aspirations of those who dare to chase the American dream."
Mortgage,"For the past 4 months, I have not received any information from Bank of America regarding my home loan modification. From XXXX 2016 through XXXX XXXX, 2016 - I submitted all required documents at the request of my then Customer Relations Manager XXXX XXXX. During the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX 2016, I made repeated calls to my newly assigned Customer Relations Manager, XXXX XXXX. 

In late XXXX - early XXXX 2016, I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX on behalf of XXXX XXXX, I immediately returned the call only to receive XXXX XXXX 's voicemail. I have left numerous voicemail messages with XXXX XXXX and have not received any returned calls nor any updates to the my home loan modification request of which I was told by XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2016 was under review with the underwriters and they had all the documents needed to continue my request for review. 

Yesterday, I received correspondence from the Bank of America dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 indicating my loan is no longer actively being review because they did not receive the requested documents. All documents were sent XXXX and fascimile in XXXX 2016. 

This has been going on for the past 3 years, I need results. My credit is severely being damaged only because of the mortgage, my other creditors are more than satisfied with my accounts. 

I have uploaded numerous documents to demonstrate I was compliant with all of Bank of America 's request. The most important document is the one demonstrating I provided all document requests and those documents were uploaded into the Bank of America Portal. 
I am unable to appeal this decision because the only contact number I am giving is for XXXX XXXX - and he does n't return calls. Thus leaving me in a very precarious situation."
Mortgage,I applied for a loan modification with Bank of America about 9 months ago. After 3 months of submitting documents I was told I did not live in my house. This was not true. They had the documentation to prove I lived there. I then submitted additional documents to prove I lived there. This time they came back and said on their NPV that I could get 5.125 % over 40 years if I had extra income. My husband was able to contribute the extra income and we resubmitted. B of A sold the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX but they are still the master servicer. This loan should have been modified along with others in the securitized class action lawsuit of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the trustee ) and Bank of America. since XXXX is the investor. Bank of America was aware of this and chose to ignore the instructions of the settlement.

The VMRP guidelines specified a 90 day application review process, but it is taking longer than the current notified timeframe. I've been unable to get a timeline update from VMRP. I was informed my my VMRP case manager that Bank of America delay in returning the Corroboration Agreement delayed the process of Bank of America accounts. I did a 3 way call with BOA and VMRP reps because it was the only way that I could prove that I was asking the right questions and had an active application with VMRP. I am currently at my max forbearance option with BOA, had a deferral option presented by Bank of America that needed to be signed by XX/XX/XXXX ; however, signing it would disqualify me from VMRP, and I not have access to the referral option if something fails with VMRP."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX Loan number - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX Good morning, We're writing to you, in the hopes that you will assist us in managing our request for a loan modification with Bank of America. 

We're already encountering deception and misguidance on their behalf and would greatly appreciate the CFPB stepping in to let them know that they must follow federal guidelines. 

We attempted to get help for our foreclosure situation through the North Carolina Foreclosure Prevention Fund ( NCFPF ). We tried to file for foreclosure assistance online but NCFPF website was unable to upload all of our documents. We then contacted one of their offices in XXXX XXXX and were given the run around for months having to continually resubmit documents and information that had already been provided. We eventually reached out to another office in XXXX which was able to successfully submit our application. The organization stated that they would seek modification of our loan to assist us but that is not what happened. They basically wanted to refinance our loan an we would have had to bring over {$19000.00} to the closing of the new loan. We are now attempting to request modification of our loan through Bank of America. 

Our most recent request for modification began 2 1/2 weeks ago - all documentation was submitted at the same time, correctly labeled and to the correct individuals. Subsequently, we've been asked to resubmit the same few documents - 4 times. I've attached a copy of the notes from every conversation that we've had so far with them. 

it's clear that Bank of America is using deceptive business practices and trying to delay this process, in an effort to discourage us from pursuing this modification.

I emailed him all the requested items on XX/XX/XXXX and Mr. XXXX requested even more stuff on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX all answered and sent as many times as requested.

Bank of America is not treating me fairly or honestly with dealing with this loan. It will be time to sell this house on XX/XX/XXXX and they will still be asking for documents. If I don't qualify for modification then a short sale or other option should be made available and they need to approve a short sale amount. Bank of America is not dealing fairing with me due to the discharge of bankruptcy and the fact that this loan is FHA and insured by HUD so they don't lose as much as I will if we get put out. We will be homeless and the bank will have its cash flow. I want the bank to deal with me fairly and start responding to my request for help and stop saying I haven't sent in paperwork. I have given them everything they could need to do what they need to do and respond fairly."

I have attached a time line of all of my interactions with BOA over the summer as I worked with them to get assistance with a loan modification. Basically, I have complied with every request when I received it. Their communication with me was not accurate, I had to deal with a different person every time. The website was not useful.

Mortgage,"Dear CFPB Team, thank you for listening.

By way of introduction, I have Bank of America ( BOfA ) relationship across Mortgage, Platinum Honors Savings, Credit Card and Auto Loan.

I have been a mortgage customer of BOfA since XXXX, which was subsequently refinanced by the same bank in XXXX. As part of IRS Tax process, I was required to submit form 1098 for the initial mortgage account, which was closed in XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, when logging into the Bank of America, I could not access the older mortgage account, and it is therefore I had a call with BOfA Customer Service team, who first responded that bank can not issue statements for older accounts that are closed. Later I was advised that I have to wait for XXXX business to receive the documentation. This was after spending XXXX minutes on a call. Alternatively, I was suggested to visit the branch to explore the possibility to receive the documentation. 

When I visited the branch, BOfA branch team members initially expressed lack of system access to process the form 1098. After much escalation, I was put in touch with Branch executive who after 40 minutes, was able to share the document. 

I am expressing my sincere disappointment in having to 1/ Not have online access to documentation, 2/ Lack of clear guidance from BOfA Customer Support , and 3/ Having to visit branch and go thru the hardship to get a simple documentation that pertains to my mortgage account.

Having to pay substantial mortgage interest rates and holding significant investments, I expect BOfA to provide at least basis services in a timely fashion and with ease. Which unfortunately is not the case. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Warm Regards."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX, HUD Housing Specialist, tel # XXXX, ticket # XXXX informed us this morning that this Borrower does not qualify for the FHA Preforeclosure Sales Program due to the delinquency of over 43 months. She stated that this was a Bank of America error. She stated that it was up to the lender whether or not they would accept or reject a pending offer. 

No one from Bank of America has ever advised or disclosed this information to us or the Borrower. In fact, the information that was given us was that it was HUD that would not allow the postponement of the scheduled Trustee Sale scheduled on XXXX XXXX. No one from Bank of America has offered any "" other '' Short Sale programs that the Borrower may qualify for. Compounding the problem is that we have 2 appraisals with a significant difference in value. 

Due to this oversight, we request that the sale be postponed. We are submitting a new all cash offer for {$250000.00} today. We request that this offer be considered for a HAFA short sale or any other alternative short sale. But, we need time to properly prepare the Closing Documents based on whatever program the Borrower qualifies for. 
Any consideration less than this would not be in good faith due to the discovery of this oversight. Please escalate this to the highest level. Thank you!"

Mortgage,"Originally, I had good credit that afforded me, my husband and son the opportunity to become first-time homeowners in XXXX. Prior to divorcing my husband in XXXX XXXX, I refinanced XXXX XXXX to buy him out of the property and to get his name off of the deed. While in an adjustable arm, I began to experience financial hardship and refinanced again XXXX XXXX and ended up putting all of my equity in my home making bi-monthly payments to bring my loan down from {$230000.00} to {$210.00}, XXXX. Eventually I was assisted by an attorney ( XXXX XXXX ) to apply for a modification which took my payments from {$1600.00} to {$1200.00}. After waiting 33 months to be modified by BOA ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I received a savings of {$100.00} instead of the original savings of {$350.00} per month. I believe at some point during another review of required documents submitted again XXXX XXXX, my income as a XXXX was inflated and calculated incorrectly. Not understanding how this could happen after BOA foreclosed on my property while still in a work-out process, the foreclosure was rescinded upon the banks error as long as I accepted and their in-house modification with new monthly payments of {$1500.00}. From XXXX, it was difficult to keep up with payments, so I was encouraged to put my home up for Short Sale which was approved by the bank XXXX XXXX. After several weeks of no activity, my realtor was asked by a new negotiator to submit and upload additional docs to XXXX. In doing so, my realtor obtained documents from BOA that I was approved for a Short Sale process again on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and we had 14 days to submit any requested documents. Not informed by my realtor of a foreclosure date and following professional advice not to make payments during the process, my home went into foreclosure the very next day on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I am made aware of the foreclosure by the office of XXXX XXXX. XXXX in a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX and told I need to vacate my property. With no where to go and not sure of my options, I was pleased when my realtor was asked if I wanted to keep my property. I responded yes and have been back-and-forth contacting Bank of America while sending correspondence to a representative of XXXX XXXX and the Law Office of XXXX XXXX. XXXX to obtain a fore-closure rescission. After seeking legal advice Fri.

Mortgage,"In XXXX of XXXX, my business got affected due to XXXX losing my household income. To meet my mortgage obligations, I used my savings to continue to pay my mortgage payments. Furthermore, in XX/XX/2020, I encountered a medical condition and became XXXX. 

When I explained my situation to Bank of America, hereafter known as BOA, they offered to defer my mortgage payments for up to XXXX months, which I accepted. After the deferral period was over and still during the pandemic, I received a letter from BOA offering mortgage assistance program which could lower my XXXX mortgage payments if I apply for the program. I called the BOA and the agent on the phone explained how the process works and what documents they need to support my application. I immediately agreed to apply and to be reviewed for the program due to my sensitive financial status. After submitting my application and requested documents repeatedly for XXXX months, BOA denied my application. 

In the denial letter BOA stated that they were pleased to offer me a short sale program. 
I contacted BOA and spoke with XXXX agents on XXXX occasions asking the reason for the denial and pointing out that short sale can not be a right program for me, but they all referred to the denial letter since they couldnt explain me how a property with equity can be eligible for short sale. As a matter of the fact some of the agents expressed their sympathy and made notes in their system about this nonsense decision. Having realized that denials were in error, the agents asked me to re-apply for reconsideration, which I did, thus ; every XXXX weeks I was submitting supporting documents and letter of explanation but still BOA rejected my application and sent me the same denial letter as before and offering short sale. I contacted BOA and complained about their decision, and they asked me to apply again for re-consideration, which I did but still the same result. This process repeated XXXX times over the last XXXX years. 

This act of BOA by dragging my application, eliminated any opportunity that I had to refinance my mortgage to a that time market interest rate as low as XXXX XXXX. 

Now, after exhausting all my savings to continue to meet my financial obligations and maintain my hard-earned XXXX XXXX which has taken me over XXXX years to build, Im now reaching out to you asking for your help. 
I dont want to lose my house therefore, out of sheer frustration, I am writing to your office to request an investigation regarding my mortgage assistance application with BOA.

BofA will not apply our payment BofA will not return our wire BofA is threatening us with additional interest charges and delinquent reporting if we do not send them more money. 
BofA has blamed me for this occurring on a recorded phone call with "" XXXX '' XXXX sent {$67000.00} payment to BofA via wire to pay the majority or all of our balance on the HELOC XXXX made {$59.00} principal payment to BofA via online banking b/c no word on our wire being accepted.

I have received submitted multiple complaints to BofA via online banking, with no response. 

I am concerned about my money and my family 's well being at this point.

Mortgage,My mortgage service provider ( Bank of America ) has informed me that they will only accept a cashier 's check or money order for payment of my mortgage.
Mortgage,"I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX retired XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX. In my XXXX XXXX working within the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, whether in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX facing with many difficult problems and decisions, I had not run across the level of denial or ignorance that I have observed within the Bank of America system . Refusing to accept responsibilities, accountability; refusing to admit wrong doing, deliberately covering up facts and mistakes. A person or an institution not willing to admit wrongs, would not recognize those wrongs, therefore will not see a need to make corrections. 

In the last comment stated in the response on XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX XXXX, we realized that you may not be pleased with our final resolution and Bank of America considers the matter closed and will no longer respond to further inquiries ; clearing telling me and the rest of the world that Bank of America does not want to answer any pertinent questions honestly and in detail, does not want to resolve the issues, just want to sweep this mater under the rug and not wanting to deal with them. If there was a final resolution as stated, please share with me what was this final resolution from Bank of America? 

Shortly after the fire was put out by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, my home insurance XXXX issued me a check in the amount of {$170000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX as an initial payment for restoring our home. I deposited this check into my BofA account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I was not told or received any explanation that the check is being handled differently than any other checks. After XXXX months not seeing this amount available I started calling BofA to find out what happen to my fund supposed to be available for me to pay the contractor. I finally received funding in my account ( XXXX and a half months later ), but only {$57000.00} was released to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I called BofAs Property claims for an explanation. I was told that because there were dishonest contractors out there who failed to perform as expected, BofA has to closely monitor how funding is released by ordering periodic home inspection, review the report closely and carefully, authenticate the written report with the accompanied photos that the percentage of job completion is accurate before disbursing the fund. Bank of America failed to accomplish that process. 

If BofA had reviewed the XX/XX/XXXX report closely along with the photos, the 60 % job completion failed to support the amount of work done in accordance with the photos taken by the inspector. Why was that not caught the eyes of the BofA personnel who were responsibility in reviewing the report? Past experience that BofA has with the possibility of dishonest contractors doing less work and receiving more pay from its customers has driven BofA to initiate a procedure to closely and carefully review home inspection report for job progress before funding release. BofA has internal guidelines and SOP that their personnel has to follow to insure the effectiveness of this program and to prevent mishaps. Your personnel had done their part to withhold insurance disbursed funds ; they had also done their part to order the home inspection reports. BofA personnel had failed to properly review and authenticate the reports for validity and accuracy. If this last step was done when the XX/XX/XXXX inspection report was received ; the percentage of job completion was only 30 % and not 60 % ; and the second payment of {$46000.00} should not have released on XX/XX/XXXX. This system of check and balanced has not included the homeowners ( who know their home ) or the insurance company who pay for the home restoration, only BofA has this report and not diligently managed or processed them. ( see attached faulty XXXX inspection report ) Unreasonably closing a case by not giving a satisfactory explanation would not solve a problem, if Bank of America still think that it is not liable for the insurance fund mismanagement action, give me a satisfactory explanation ( 1 ) why you are not liable for failing to follow your own process? ( 2 ) Why disbursing more fund than work done creating an opportunity for abuse by dishonest contractors is not your liability? ( 3 ) why failing to review the inspection reports closely and carefully is not your responsibility? ( 4 ) Why even bother to order for home inspection if you are not going to read the content carefully before disbursing fund? Please answer all points by the number, and again do not give schoolbook answers that every one already know. I would not be asking those question if you are following your procedures by the book. 

In the past XXXX complaints I filed, BofA had totally ignored or to address this process is not being followed, recklessly issued my fund and blatantly blaming me for my action. Please address your home inspection process how you exercise your review and authenticate those reports as accurate leading to appropriate funding release. Again, please do not give me schoolbook answers as you did in the past. I want to know what your Property Claim personnel really did with those reports and why they had missed such critical errors I had filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for fabricating and falsified home inspection reports ( see attached falsified reports ). XXXX is contracted by Bank of America and BofA is totally responsible for its action for the deliberate delivery of falsified home inspection reports, and BofA acted upon their results in releasing fund to me. If BofAs verifying process not including the homeowner when those reports become available, then BofAs system is flawed, and a flawed system resulting in harm done to BofA customers, BofA is still liable for the damage and must compensate for its mistakes. Bank of America is holding my insurance fund and not diligently managing that fund, Bank of America is liable for the mis- management of that fund leading to more money release than work done. 

Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX are the professionals who have the knowledge of the definition of percentage of job completion and details how the percentage arrives. A lay person like myself is lacking that knowledge, and thats the reason I have to rely on them to assure the amount of work done by the XXXX is accurately assessed. Misinterpreting that value leading to wrong judgment is the liability of Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX. A mistake is unintentional, a misguided act ; but an intentional misdirection is more than a mistake. Both Bank of America and XXXX had made several intentional misdirection leading to harm done to me financially. Please do not ignore this comment, give a reasonable and acceptable explanation if you disagree!"
Mortgage,On XX/XX/2020 we refinanced our home mortgage.The new mortgage company paid off the previous mortgage with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. We have not received the $ XXXX balance refund from our BofA escrow account. I have called numerous times and waited on hold for approximately 7 hours in total. The last person I spoke with said they had mailed the check  on XXXX XXXX. We have not received it. I asked if the money could be sent to our Bank of America checking account instead but was told it had to be a mailed check. Our mail has been unreliable lately and it seems we will never get the money we are owed. Bank of America does not return calls they promise to return nor have they responded to the emails I have sent through their online site other than to say someone will be back in touch within a few days. They never are. I tried to set up an appointment to go into a branch or have someone to call me but their system will not allow me to make either type of appointment.
Mortgage,"During the covid pandemic we had our mortgage through Bank of America ... they offered us the Covid protection program where we could defer our mortgage payments during the pandemic and they would simply put the balance of missing payments to the end of our loan... not changing our rate or payments. We entered the program and were told that our first payment of reinstatement would be XX/XX/2021. We called on XXXX XXXX to make that payment and were told we couldn't make it because we didn't submit the proper paperwork... we questioned what paperwork. We were told something was sent in the mail. We did not receive any such paperwork. They told us they would re-send it and should receive in two weeks. We didn't receive it in two weeks and re-called them. The next person told us we could make the payment and once again they would resend the paper work. Which again never came. We called on the first of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and continued to make our payments... each time being told we were fine ... all the while receiving statements in the mail saying we were getting further and further behind in our payments, but being reassured each time on the phone that we were in the covid program and were fine. We received a foreclosure warning XXXX and called again. They told us to make a second payment in XXXX, which we did by phone. Immediately after we were informed that our Mortgage had been sold to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has demanded the {$40000.00} which was supposed to be added to the end of the loan from the deferment program. They are refusing to acknowledge the covid protection program that we were in with Bank of America. Bank of America sold our loan without adding those deferred amounts to the end of our loan as promised. We now have to come up with {$40000.00} in funds that we do not have thanks to the pandemic to keep the home we built ourselves and have lived in for 15 years. We feel that Bank of America was fraudulent in their covid protection program for selling our loan before finishing the restructure of our loan. XXXX XXXX insisted that we apply for a loan modification which we make more then enough money to cover our payments and they denied it."
Mortgage,"Bank of America canceled our mortgage application, 7 days before closing, claiming we lacked sufficient funds available for closing. For almost 30 days, BoA had the necessary information to see proof that we had sufficient funds, but apparently never processed the documents internally so that they were available to the underwriter. Initially, our mortgage officer claimed we were denied for not submitting a copy of a check showing sale of a mututal funds for closing funds, but later admited they never asked for the canceled check. For 3+ weeks, it appears BOA did not process any documentation they had requested, then at the last minute, tried to fix their errors. Mortgage officer was unreasonably hard to get ahold of, ignored multiple requests for status updates, then had the audacity to blame us, the consumer, for Bank of America 's own failings. Had Bank of America reviewed the documents they had requested and received in a timely manner, they would have seen sufficient funds for closing, or would have had time to request further information. BoA did neither - they simply canceled a mortgage application 7 days before closing, 38 days into the process. 

We acted in good faith, submitting all requested documentation within 24 hours at each request. We sent multiple emails requesting status updates and got no response. Bank of America simply failed to execute the mortgage application due to their own errors and mistakes. Their reasoning for cancellation ignores the multiple documents submitted that clearly show our ability to close. 

It 's hard for us to understand anything we could have done better. Bank of America clearly failed, clearly made mistakes and clearly canceled our mortgage due to their own errors. The consumer is left dealing with the damage and heartache while Bank of America can move on to other mortgages as if nothing has happened."
Mortgage,"Ever since Bank of America took over my mortgage from Countrywide, I have had problems getting my homeowners insurance on record. 

I buy my own homeowners, it is effective on XX/XX/XXXX. There has never been a lapse. With Countrywide, no issue. Company faxed the coverage, went on record, over and done. With Bank of America, each year, proof of coverage has to be faxed, and refaxed, sometimes 3 or 4 times. 

This year, I called the insurance company, prior to the effective date, and asked them to please fax the proof of coverage. They did, said it went through. In my ignorance, and not hearing from the company, thought, this year was different. No such luck. 

Received a letter saying they were increasing my monthly mortgage to cover the insurance they put on the house. I called said, no, there was homeowners, effective XX/XX/XXXX. Also said proof of insurance had been faxed to them prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Person on the phone asked to have it refaxed to a different number. This was done, called and was told they had the fax, all was well. Received a letter saying the additional monthly payment was taken off. Which I foolishly thought took care of the matter, so burned the letter. 

Today have an email saying to pay the additional or my credit would be effected. 

I do not know what to do, say, plead, threaten to get this over to them, homeowners is paid, proof is sent ( have asked so many times to have it refaxed it has become an issue with the agent and me ) every year. I do not owe for what they can not take care of. How do I handle this? 

A few years ago had a response from some vice-president apologizing for the problem. Does n't seem to have improved the situation. 

Where do I go from here? Is there something you can do?"
Mortgage,"Bank of America informed me that XXXX, XXXX was servicing my mortgage. I contacted XXXX and was told that Bank of America is still servicing the mortgage. I want to avoid foreclosure but have received multiple points of contact and do n't know who I should speak to. Please help."
Mortgage,"I am the borrower on a Conventional loan that started in XXXX. The original purchase price was {$320000.00}. I have been paying PMI for more than 17 years. 

Per the consumer protection act PMI should have automatically stopped when the loan balance was 80 % of the original purchase price. 

Bank of America failed to acknowledge that surely after 10 years ( in XXXX ) the loan balance was less than 80 %. 

When I spoke to Bank of America they disagreed with me and took a stand they what they did by collecting PMI on a loan for more than 15 years was proper. 

There is no way a borrower should be paying PMI for over 15 years. 

Bank of Americas policies to collect PMI are unfair to borrowers and similar to government having people pay on student loans for 20 or more years.

This standard of not removing PMI once LTV is 80 % of the original purchase price is predatory and should be illegal. 

Bank of America sent me some documents to support their decision. However they failed to send the documents from their Escrow department dated prior to XXXX that show that mortgage was eligible for PMI removal a long time ago. This is dishonest and unfair to borrowers. 

Laws need to be changed so borrowers are not paying PMI way pass the point of that 80 % LTV point. 

Lenders should not be profiting off of collecting PMI for 10 to 20 years."
Mortgage,"My Husband and I went through bank of America for a loan to purchase a home. Prior to making an offer, we approached XXXX XXXX XXXX at BOA to see what we can qualify for and get pre-qualification. After our visit and presentation of all the requested document, he issued us a loan application number ; XXXX and told us we are good to present our offer from BOA to the sellers agent. At that point, we contacted an agent XXXX XXXX to represent us as we began the process. We also gave {$5000.00} to be held in escrow as our commitment to the home. 
With no pending reason for a denial because we had a credit in the low XXXX 's, and sufficient amount in the bank to cover for approximately XXXX-XXXX % of our purchase price, we proceeded. 
one days prior to close of the loan, the Bank of America Home service specialist, called us saying that the loan will not be approved and asked if we have "" more money to put down '' very devastated as this was only approximately a day prior to close and us receiving keys. 
He proceeded to tell us that the initial loan he thought would work for us, which was a XXXX loan ( he called it a XXXX. Loan ) was not possible and that he did n't know it was for only XXXX. He was asking for another almost XXXX after we have showed proof of over XXXX that we had set aside for this home. 
We contacted the seller and our agent of this grave disappointment and then proceeded to check out other options as we were told that BOA is notorious for such practices. 
We went with XXXX who offered us a jumbo loan with better terms. But as loyal bank of america customers which we have been since we were married, we wanted to give them another chance since they had all our information and we wanted to close in a timely manner. they promised and appealed with us that they would match the Credit Union Offer and we again believed them and cancelled our application with XXXX to come back to bank of America. again the same thing happened. two days before close of escrow, and us receiving the keys, Bank of America again called and said they could not close the loan and wanted us to furnish about 1 year of home payments verifiable in our account in addition to 25 % down payment. 
they had switched the script on us so much that we could not get the loan or the home that we felt very confident we could afford and had very strong credit and work income. We make over XXXX year and have great credit but for whatever reason, this incompetent banker or the inefficient methods of bank of america home mortgage department caused us much grief, disappointment and shame. 
To worsen matters, our {$5000.00} deposit to the escrow company has not been refunded and we need this amount refunded. We did not chose to abandon the process we could not qualify and get approval for the home we wanted to buy and we see no reason why our deposit to the escrow company is being held. Please we need this rectified and this mischief and thievery addressed with the Escrow company XXXX XXXX and Bank of America. 

Thanks"
Mortgage,"We have had a terrible experience closing our mortgage with Bank of America despite us providing all requested documents to them in a timely fashion. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2019, we received a mortgage loan commitment for a fixed-rate conventional mortgage on the property we were purchasing with a scheduled closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. The bank informed us that this would be an easy closing date to make, and that just two pieces of follow-up documentation would be requested of us -- namely, a homeowners ' insurance policy for the property, which we provided on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and documentation of our XXXX money deposit, which we provided in XXXX. We relied to our detriment on the bank 's representation that we would have no trouble meeting the XX/XX/XXXX date ; had we known that the bank would be unable to meet this date we could have easily found a different lender. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were provided with a preliminary closing disclosure which contained at least one error -- namely, it required us to escrow payment for our homeowners ' insurance policy despite the bank previously agreeing that we could pay that amount directly rather than out of escrow. We contacted our lending XXXX, XXXX XXXX, multiple times by phone and by email but were not able to connect with him to discuss this matter. 

On the morning of our scheduled closing, XX/XX/XXXX, the bank told us we would have all documentation by XXXX. This time was pushed back 3 times throughout the day, as we increasingly tried to get the attention of the bank. Eventually, at XXXX on the date of closing, the bank asked for more documentation, which we provided immediately. 

At this point, our closing was delayed by a day. Once again, throughout the day on XX/XX/XXXX, we continued to attempt to contact the bank. Once again, every hour the bank would promise that they could provide us with closing documentation within another hour or two, and continued to be unable to deliver. Everyone we spoke to was apologetic and told us that they didnt know any more about the source of the delay than we did. Our sellers threatened to walk away with our substantial deposit. Finally, after hours on XX/XX/XXXX, we signed our paperwork. 

We were not given a meaningful opportunity to review our paperwork before we signed. We discovered errors but were unable to correct them due to the late hour and the threat of losing our deposit. Among other things, we were forced to add our homeowners insurance premium to our escrow amount despite having already paid it out of pocket. Certain items, including the prepaid amount of property taxes, were changed between our preliminary closing disclosure and the one that was presented to us at our actual closing, and these changes were not explained to us. Our deed was unable to be filed before the close of business, which meant that we were unable to access our new house for an entire weekend. We also had to reschedule critical, long-since-scheduled meetings with a XXXX and service provider due to this delay. 

This should have been an extremely straightforward closing ; due to Bank of Americas negligence weve been ultimately denied access to the house we have bought for more than 4 days and we signed inaccurate paperwork under immense time pressure to avoid losing a substantial deposit."
Mortgage,"XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX is not & hasn't been our loan holder for years. They are sending us TIME SENSITIVE, FINAL ATTEMPT, IMMEDIATE RESPONSE letters on pink paper claiming our home owners insurance has expired. WE know its XXXX & a scam but my wife cares for the elderly and they get frightened by these scams! The NOTICEs are very predatory in nature. Their intention is to scare people into calling. We haven't called XXXX  & honestly, it shouldn't be us calling some hourly employee. This needs a throat punch to the CEOS. Sincerely, The XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"I purchased my property in XX/XX/XXXX and the original lender was Countrywide. The lender on the XXXX was XXXX XXXX. For the first 10 years, I was to pay interest-only. Then, the financial crisis of XX/XX/XXXX caused me to lose my job and I found it difficult to make my monthly payments. So in XXXX of XXXX, through HARP, I spoke with a certified HUD advisor from Hope Now, and she suggested that I contact Countrywide to see if XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX owned my loan, write a hardship letter stating my financial situation, and that I would like either a Homeowner Affordability Stability Plan ( 30 year fixed that combines both my loans ) or a review of my account to receive a lower rate freeze for either a five year fix or for the life of the loan. She also suggested as a backup that I ask about a "" write-down of principal balance '' or a "" refinance with a short payoff ''. I sent letters to both Countrywide and to XXXX XXXX, and one year later, there was no resolution, no help at all from either bank, but I continued to make my payments through any means necessary, including borrowing from friends and family. I was told that if I defaulted on my loan by NOT making payments for at least three months, that they would "" consider '' refinancing or modifying my loan, but if I was declined, they would foreclose on my property. I had just had my first child and scrambling to find a place to live did n't sound appealing so I kept making the payments while still trying to get the banks to simply offer me XXXX consolidated loan at a fixed rate. XXXX eventually became the lender for my first loan and Bank of America became the lender for my second loan, but nothing changed with them either. Because I could n't find a job, in XX/XX/XXXX, I went back to school to work on my Masters. I was still trying to get one consolidated loan at a fixed rate with no success. I kept making payments. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had no help from either bank and was getting more and more worried that the 10-year interest only program would end with much higher rates and cause me to default on the loan, this time because I could n't afford the payments. HARP was ineffective so I turned to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and after providing them with hundreds of pages of documents and sitting at an all-day event XXXX miles from my home, they were unable to assist me. My next attempt to get assistance was by calling XXXX directly, and they directed me to XXXX XXXX to see if they would help me. XXXX XXXX told me that they would not refinance my loan to a fixed rate because the monthly payments would wind up being slightly more than what I was currently paying at that time. I told the representative that I could probably handle a slight increase in monthly payments if I could get in a fixed rate, but I did n't want to get caught with a much higher rate after the 10 year interest only arm was over. He insisted that he could n't assist me because of banking laws. By XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX was continuing to contact me to try resubmitting the paperwork, so out of desperation, I agreed and gathered a new batch of documents and resubmitted it all again, but they were still ineffective in their efforts. By XX/XX/XXXX, my worse fears came true. The 10-year interest only program ended and my mortgage payments more than doubled. I ca n't afford it. I tried to seek a modification with XXXX but they declined me because of my underemployment but they offered me a 6-month forbearance and told me that I 'd have to accept the offer immediately or they would start foreclosing, so I accepted, but I have reapply in XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America declined me altogether with no alternatives. Since I received these XXXX loans, I 've paid these banks roughly {$200000.00} in interest and never missed a payment. They helped people who were less responsible and did not help me from a situation they created."
Mortgage,"We have a XXXX and XXXX with Bank of America. My husband and I have got caught up in the predatory lending of several years ago when the housing crashed. We continued to pay our mortgage, at XXXX point we were given a temporary modification ; however that did not solve the issue. I am well aware we make some bad decisions. When we signed the loan with an adjustable rate we were told it was only temporary and would only be within 5 years and we would be able to refinance to a fixed rate. 
We have repeatedly tried to get the loan modified to a fixed rate with a lower rate, currently we are paying 9 % adjustable and a XXXX at 12 % with a balloon.. We are paying over {$1800.00} for a {$200000.00} loan on a house that is not worth {$150000.00}. We made another attempt to have the loan modified, we were turned down. BOA turned down the modification, but stated they will support a short sale. We have been in this house over 21 years and have attempted to stay. They are basically saying they will give a lower rate/fair mortgage to a new buyer but will not work us ; with the customers who have paid faithfully when 'normal ' people in this situation would have walked away along time ago. We estimated we have paid them over {$200000.00} already. This should be a crime."
Mortgage,"I have Bank of America borrower protection plan. I 'm XXXX. Not able to pay mortgage. But the plan never triggered and now they are foreclosing. I do n't understand. The plan states it will make the payments when I 'm XXXX. Yet, they have proceeding to foreclose after sending in all claim paperwork?"
Mortgage,"Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX   XXXX  We started the short sale process with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. We faxed in our authorization multiple times over the past 30 days, requesting a payoff demand. BAC is refusing to provide a Payoff Demand. 

Today they are claiming that the loan has been charged off. In turn I asked that we receive either a payoff demand showing the balance due, if any ; OR a Reconveyence of the 2nd XXXX. I was told by Customer Service that the short sale department handles these requests. The short sale dept told me that the chargeoff dept handles these requests for charged-off loans. I then spoke to the charge-off dept who told me that only the short sale dept can help me. I spoke again to the short sale department and they sent me back to the chargeoff dept. 


In every conversation I was directed to a different department, who then told me that dont actually have the ability to process my request for the payoff demand on this loan. 


At this point Bank of America has acknowledged my authorization as an agent for RE XXXX XXXX. They have also told us in writing that the loan is charged off. THEREFORE -- -- -- -- Bank of America has TWO options EITHER provide a payoff demand to me as the authorized third party -- - OR Reconvey the lien off the property. But THESE DELAY TACTICS AND GAMES HAVE TO STOP. It is obvious Bank of America is completely incompetent in dealing with these types of loans AND THIS IS PURPOSEFUL FRAUD ON THEIR PART. 



*******BANK OF AMERICA SEEMS TO HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEIR 2ND MORTGAGES ARE THAT HAVE BEEN CHARGED OFF ********** NO ONE CAN HELP ME GET A PAYOFF DEMAND ********** THIS IS THE 2ND FILE WITHIN THE PAST 3 WEEKS THAT WE HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE ********** OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH BANK OF AMERICAS RECORD-KEEPING. 


****************************PLEASE SEE CFPB COMPLAINT # FILED ON XX/XX/XXXX -- CASE # XXXX **************************"
Mortgage,"This is in response to case number XXXX. I placed a complaint against Bank of America, and just got a summary of research from Bank of America. Am I really to expect that BOA would honestly and without prejudice conduct pure research into my complaint against them? Is there not an independent omsbudsman or review panel to investigate claims? In my original claim, I specifically stated that my case was mismanaged, and yet, the word "" mismanage '' did not occur anywhere in the summary of their findings. Therefore, I argue that they had bias in conducting this research because of the omission of this claim. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX stated repeatedly how Bank of America wants customers "" to be pleased '' with their service. Again, if this research was carried out independently, this is a statement that should not be made. XXXX XXXX stated that BOA was grateful for me paying off the loan in full, which is ironic because during the payout process, BOA "" advisers '' suggested I should in fact do a short sale if I could not bring the full amount I owed to the closing. The simple fact that I am sking for {$5000.00} in forgiveness towards INTEREST - not principle mind you, but INTEREST - and BOA will not concede is frightening. {$5000.00} is less than XXXX XXXX of the BOA CEO 's paycheck. So BOA thanks me for saving them money by not conducting a short sale, but can not do any more than verbally acknowledge this point. 
In summary - I disagree with allowing BOA to conduct their own investigation as this is not impartial. They missed many facts including the main one that BOA mismanaged my account and summarily dismissed any short sale assistance because of incompetence by their agents."
Mortgage,Selling a mortgage that is in a remic that has no filings with the sec ever I want some answers?
Mortgage,"I have tried to work with Bank of America my Servicer since XX/XX/XXXX. I have not been able to complete a loan modification due to XXXX Customer Relationship Managers and XXXX folks from the Office of the CEO for Bank of America. During a Loan Modification XX/XX/XXXX they removed my Customer Relationship Manager and sent my loan to Foreclosure. I sent in all the documents that were required. They lost my XXXX to reinstate my loan and took my 10 days to get them to find my money to reinstate my loan. I applied for a modification and Bank of America never returned my calls or worked with me. I have been in contact with someone from Bank of America 's Executive Department and he wo n't call me back since XXXX CST on XX/XX/XXXX. Today I have received a letter that I no longer have a dedicated Customer Relationship Manager and I have left multiple messages an NO ONE returns my phone call as I 'm trying to resolve this matter. The allonge to my note finally presented to me says I was sent into a securitization. I have asked my Investor, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide me with a copy of the PSA and no response. The allonge to my note was endorsed by Countrywide Home by XXXX XXXX ... .with initials only and after contacting the Secretrary of State of California that is not her notorized signature transferring real estate only my note was initialled. I have offered to make arrangements to settle with Bank of America and the note holder for the Securitization with no response."
Mortgage,loan was with Bank of America the modification was a temporary fix mod was interest only from 2 % to 4.75 % now with deferred balance
Mortgage,"I requested escrow be removed since the loan to value is less than 80 %. 
I received a letter from Bank of America stating the reason it was denied. 

I then called and spoke to a manager in escrow named XXXX. He then provided a different reason that was Not written on the letter. 

There is something wrong in that Escrow Department. They send in writing a letter saying one thing ( which is incorrect ) and then when it was pointed out their calculation was wrong, XXXX provided a different reason."
Mortgage,"I refinanced my {$650000.00} mortgage and {$80000.00} home equity line of credit ( "" Heloc '' ) from Bank of America to XXXX XXXX. The closing occurred on XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the funding occurred on XX/XX/. Prior to the closing I checked online to find out how much interest was accrued as of the funding date and received a response from Bank of America. However, Bank of America insisted that an additional 5 days of mortgage interest and 9 days of Heloc interest ( beyond the funding date ) be included in the closing costs. This amounted to {$720.00}. I contacted the local law firm that was representing Bank of America XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and spoke with XXXX XXXX prior to the closing date. I received an unsatisfactory explanation as to why it is necessary to collect the additional interest at the closing. As expected, the funding took place on time and Bank of America was paid in full on XXXX XXXX, including the overpayment of {$720.00}. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the afternoon and told her that I expect to receive a refund from Bank of America within the next 3 business days in the amount of {$720.00}. She told me that because their firm will include the check for the entire amount of the accrued interest owed to Bank of America in their XXXX XXXX XXXX  Bank of America will not deposit the check until XX/XX/. Therefore, I am responsible for the extra day of interest notwithstanding the fact that all of the funds were delivered to their law office by early afternoon on XX/XX/. In addition, she advised me that it will take 14 days for Bank of America to refund the overpayment that they insisted they must have in order for the closing and funding to take place. In other words, I am being charged {$150.00} interest for the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) by 2 Banks. Correctly by XXXX XXXX and incorrectly by Bank of America. I checked online and found out that the number of mortgages that are issued on an annual basis range from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Accordingly, if the average amount of duplicate lender interest charges approximated {$100.00} per consumer, consumers are paying between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in duplicate interest charges ( in addition to waiting 2 weeks to receive the excess interest consumers are required to fund at the funding date ). This is outrageous and lenders and their agents should not be allowed to take advantage of consumers in this manner."
Mortgage,"I requested Bank of America to cancel my PMI. 

I received a letter stating my investor requires a current market value. This is not true see letter from Bank of America. 

I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating my investor requires an appraisal. This is also not true. 

On the letter it states an agent or broker will contact me to schedule the appointment to provide an appraised value. 

Real estate agents and real estate brokers are not licensed to provide appraisals in Georgia. Since they are not licensed to provide appraisals, what service are they providing. 

The letter says they will be providing the current appraised value. Bank of America could use an AVM, automated valuation model to do this."
Mortgage,"I have tried to work with the CFPB for more than 3 years now with no results. However I have not given up. For more than 10 years I tried to get Bank of America to refinance or do a loan modification on my home. Their loan counselors at Bank of America have lied for more than 10 years and I have sent the information to the CFPB at the XXXX, IA XXXX address form more than a year proving that they Bank of America has lied to me constantly. You can also see much of my correspondence with the CFPB if you look at XXXX # : XXXX XXXX. I submitted proof that BofA was committing crimes with their practices. They would assign a counselor to work with me for three to four months and when the counselor was to make a decision they would send me a letter or notice from another person in another city or state and say that I am to work with this new counselor. BofA would then have me start the entire process again and they did this by assigning me more than XXXX different counselors before they could give me an answer. Each time they assigned me a new person to work with they would start the entire process over and over again asking for exactly the same information that I had already provided more than 6 different times. I did finally speak to one semi honest person that was assigned to me and she informed me that Bank of America would not give me a loan modification because I was current with my payments and I had to make up for all of the dead beats who either walked away from their mortgages or they were behind in their payments. I provided all of these facts to you office without any results what so ever. Since the CFPB has abandoned me BofA has increased my monthly payments twice and now they have just increased it again. I am a XXXX veteran with an Honorable Discharge on a fixed income and you think that I could get some government agency to help me fight these lying crooks at BofA however it seems to me that there is no such agency. How can a financial institution deny someone with good credit the ability to refinance or get a loan modification on their home for 10+ years and the homeowner can get no help from any government agency? If you look at complaints against BofA there are thousands just like mine that are present. This is not an exception this is the norm for BofA. I have letters from individuals saying they are responding on behalf of the President of BofA and they give me the same old XXXX over and over again. The reason why I looked into a loan modification is because the first person I spoke to at BofA told me to look into a loan modification because of the housing crash. All of this information has been filed with the CFPB and they have done nothing that I can see to help. More than likely the CFPA will send this information to BofA and their personnel will start their lies all over again however I have submitted proof of their un American lies to the CFPB."
Mortgage,"I contacted Bank of America in the third quarter of 2019 about a workout modification on my residence. I complied with all of the numerous requirements, answered all of the questions, and received my trial modification. I complied with all of the requirements for the trial and was issued a permanent modification in late XXXX, with a deadline of XXXX XXXX. I complied with that timeline, submitted the signed documentation through their portal, and followed with a paper copy. I contacted them to make my payment on XXXX XXXX, and was told that the modification was not set up yet in their system, but that a payment could be made. I made the new payment amount on that date. I then was contacted on XXXX XXXX asking if I verbally consented to the modification. The representative had no idea that I had submitted the signed mod, confirmed the the mod STILL was not updated into my account, and wanted me to verbally consent to a modification that I had already submitted to them in writing. Twice. Subsequent to that ( that afternoon ), I received a countersigned copy of my modification paperwork. Late yesterday, I received a partial payment notification, reflecting that my payment was posted as my PRIOR, non-modification amount, with an amount placed into suspense, or partial balance, etc., but not as a full payment per my modification terms. Further, my account still showed an outstanding pre-modification default balance. This balance was handled by the modification, and now it appears that I still owe approx. 15,000 in default balance, despite the fact that I complied and continue to comply with all terms. I contacted Bank of America and was told that it would take "" two weeks '' because of the holidays to update my account, despite the fact that 8 business days have already passed since I submitted the documentation to them. I'm worried that my property may be in jeopardy if someone doesn't check another section to verify that a modification exists, and pass this loan on to foreclosure due to their negligent handling. I need a resolution."
Mortgage,i got the banks response to my inquire that is wrong my situation has changed but the payment should be a lot lower than it is do n't you think look at the high interest you do n't know if the situation has changed or not just guessing but it has changed my brother just got a new job but you see the payment ever drops at all the payment is to high for anyone does matter of any situation thanks
Mortgage,"Back in XXXX, we purchased our home. bought it for XXXX was scheduled to be paid of in XXXX XXXX but to our surprise it is not. Bank of America is saying we still owe XXXX. Back in XXXX we ran into a problem with Nations Bank, we were 2 payments of XXXX, they sent our check back and said we were going to forclose on your loan. Tried to reason with them but to no avail. Contacted HUD to save our home. It took 10 months for a appointment for HUD to assign our mortgage. We meet with a gentlemen from HUD, in XXXX at the HUD office. At the beginning of the meeting we handed him a check for about {$12000.00}. Because we were told to still put your payments away, by the person on the phone that was taking our appointment. He said he did not want it, that he was recommending a Forbearance Agreement which means that you will make up the payments during the course of your loan. We were a little confused about it but at this point we were desperate for help. So we put the money into some remolding that needed to be done. To make a long story short, Bank of America offered a loan modification in XXXX to try to save our home. Only to be shot down on their decision, on a short sale of our home. They offered several ways they could help, and they picked a short sale, they said due to the Trustee and Guarantor did not approve a modification, because a affordable payment can not be created without changing the terms of your loan? We were just fine with our payments and told my case manager that. Refusing to budge, not even taking my payments, per my case manager, she said her hands are tied. Given no other option. No answers as to why this is owed. Been since XX/XX/XXXX, trying to get records of my payment history, ect. They are stonewalling me for the answers. Need help, but no help as of yet. the amount owed is about 1/3 of our original loan? Why? Have not refinanced or entered in a Loan modification at all, only up until XXXX of this year to try to save our home. This is very disheartning to realize after thirty years you could loose your home. If you need any documents to help with my complaint, there is a lot. I will fax to you at the time of request."
Mortgage,There is delayed that is being reported on my credit report appears to be inaccurate and or misleading. Please make sure to supply proof that this claimed account was in fact overdue and you have the important guidelines to be able to adequately learn more about your allegations. I highly recommend you present this information or simply remove the negativity of this kind of account right away.
Mortgage,"This is my XXXX complaint against BOA and their corrupt loan modification process. I have new information that I have recently received. For over 4 years BOA has continuously denied all loan mods due to it not being the mortgage holder 's primary resident. They do exist as per XXXX XXXX @ BOA ( XXXX XXXX ) and there are about XXXX of them at an interest rate of 4 %. XXXX from XXXX until XXXX was XXXX @ XXXX. I recently requested copies of all loan mod denial letters and were sent to me. The XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I have their copy and my original copy. Theirs says "" you are not eligible for loan mod '' .The original XXXX states "" you do not meet the basic eligibility rules, and they did not even review any of the paperwork ''. The paperwork that has been faxed to them for years and hundreds of copies, XXXX times per loan mod request. All the other denials mailed to me said "" they did not receive requested documents ''. Which is a total lie. The Judge also ordered my income to be added to my father 's income for the loan mod request that was denied XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Throughout this 4 year period I have many names on BOA paperwork sent to me that I believe DO NOT EXIST. They were all left many messages and never received XXXX reply. Names will be submitted via fax with other paperwork. If this loan mod request was approved on the XXXX time when my father was making $ XXXX a year or more, then it would have been modified to 2 % -4 % and all would have been done. But instead they kept denying the mod request due to it was not my father 's primary residence. That is not an acceptable denial reason, as I stated before they do exist. I have recently been dealing with XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. She has been very nice but has been lying to me and not even asking for most of the same paperwork asked for before. EX : Utility bills, insurance, taxes, sewer, water, life insurance, tax returns, etc ... I think this was done just to appease me because of my complaints. XXXX also stated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that the loan modification was completed but too expensive so it was denied. Then she told me it was sent to upper management to review. Strangely, the very next day a package of a loan mod was sent. I asked her worse case scenario and she stated "" short sale '', or sign over the dead WHEN EVER I WANT ''. Now I do not believe such a statement. I plan on calling her on my day off on Weds XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and recording all her answers. The mod they sent was for a total of $ XXXX or more at a rate of 5.87 %, which was the original percent. The amount owed before this was $ XXXX. They said this was due to my father 's credit score, which of course would not be good with a foreclosure over his head for 4 years. It should be 2 % and should have been done within 30-90 days after applying the first time in XXXX. They continued to deny and deny until all the $ XXXX in equity was eaten up. Then they sent the shark lawyers in. I want this corrupt behavior dealt with very strictly. I believe they need to give me my house for free. If not, then the loan should be modified at 2 % for $ XXXX that was owed. BOA should not be allowed to be in business and they do this to everyone. Their name has the most cases in the courthouse. I know I can not take down a company like this, but I can get what is fair and just. My father and I have been put through more stress than I can even tell you for over 4 years. I must fight for what I believe to be right. "" XXXX person can make a difference and I intend to fight forever ''. I just need some help from you, the people that oversee the giant entities that do not play by the rules. I am asking for help, for I want to keep my home of 20 years for me and my animals. I will be faxing papers along with people I believe do not work at BOA and just have voicemail boxes. I will put the case # on all. Thank you for your time."
Mortgage,"Bank of America purchased a mortgage loan on the residential home of my ex-husband. He is now in a XXXX due to XXXX XXXX. Bank of America was notified that he lived in a XXXX that required him to sign over his retirement income, along with Social Security. Bank of America has now foreclosed on the residential property. In all my conversations with Bank of America, it was always told me that I was not responsible for the loan, but because I had Power of Attorney, they could talk to me. I had to file the POA with the State before they would honor it to even discuss the loan with me.. ( We divorced in the 2nd year of the original mortgage and property ownership was granted to my ex-husband by the divorce court. ) I now have POA for his medical and business care because he has no one else to help him. Bank of America knew this information and NEVER attempted to collect or report this loan on my credit report as his ex wife, in over 20 years. I was told they would n't and they did n't, until now that they have foreclosed on the property. They are now reporting it on my credit bureau and have sold the foreclosure to XXXX who is also reporting it. I now have 2 mortgage foreclosures reporting on my credit bureau for the same loan that I had a verbal agreement that I was not responsible for. ( evidenced by NO reporting or collection attempts in over 20 years ) It is NOT right that I was mislead by Bank of America and now 2 Mortgage Companies are exploiting my excellent credit as verified with no late pays or charge offs, on any of my Credit Bureaus. I received a letter from XXXX saying they were working with BOA in foreclosure on the property and the notice was NOT to be deciphered as a collection notice. Since they have NEVER attempted or discussed collecting from me or indicated I was responsible for the loan, please remove the credit reporting from my credit report. This type of exploitation by Financial institutions is crippling to consumers. It ties my hands to having a great credit history. Using unfair methods just because you can get away with it is not what America is about. We are a country of compassion. Bank of America and XXXX are NOT doing the "" right thing ''."
Mortgage,"I and my wife who is now deceased as of XX/XX/2016 applied for a second mortgage and was accepted by Bank of America at 11 % Because of high interest at that time we accepted the Loan. I am XXXX years old with social security and civil service pensions, Since my wife is deceased I no longer have her income to make payments. I recently applied to Bank of America at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX, XXXX for a loan modification to reduce my interest rate and payments, and was refused. I believe that the reason that the bank refused was that I am XXXX XXXX with a postal address in a city of predominant XXXX population. My Post Office zip code is XXXX XXXX XXXX IL, although my home is physically located in XXXX Illinois. I believe that all of the homes located in XXXX XXXX XXXX are appraised below their actual value because of XXXX occupancy. I am a veteran with service twice and am XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX."
Mortgage,"I attempted to get a loan modification or forbearance from Bank of America and they denied any assistance despite the fact that I was unemployed. In addition, I ask for a forbearance and they told me that I needed to start a new process for forbearance despite the fact that I had given them every document possible. They have been very uncooperative and have shown no desire to work with me to resolve the matter. Bank of America seem intent on foreclosure as opposed to working with consumers and they are doing this despite 10 years of consistent payments and an outrageous interest rate. Their tactics are predatory in nature."
Mortgage,"This is my second letter to the CFPB regarding the same issue with Bank of America. Bank of America purposefully, did not address the specific questions asked in my initial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ; therefore, the issues remain unresolved. I need Bank of America to answer EACH of the following questions regarding the mortgage account # XXXX : 1. Why has BOA allow XXXX days to pass from the date they were eligible to proceed with judgement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to the date the judgment was recently filed ( XX/XX/XXXX )? For what reason did BOA wait XXXX days to file the judgement? 
2.Why did BOA never respond to my written inquiry on XX/XX/XXXX ( mailed to XXXX FL, XXXX ). This is a violation on RESPA, and was never addressed. 
3. Why did BOA charge my mortgage account 19 times for the same property inspection fee on XX/XX/XXXX? This is a violation of FDCPA 15 U.S.C, 1692e ( 2 ) 4.On XX/XX/XXXX, Superior Court of Delaware issued a letter indicating they were going to dismiss the foreclosure case due to lack of judgment entered. Was BOA aware that this foreclosure case was about to be dismissed for lack of follow up with their vendor attorney? 
5. On what dates did BOA follow up with XXXX for a foreclosure case updated? List all dates. 
6. Did BOA receive a copy of the superior court letter from XX/XX/XXXX? 
7. For what reason did BOA file an amended foreclosure complaint on XX/XX/XXXX? 
8. Why was the correct mortgage rate not calculated per the loan agreement ( in the foreclosure complaint )? Your response indicated "" your research has uncovered no reasonable factual basis to substantiate your claim ''. Allow me to clarify ; in the amended complaint, BOA charged all interest at a rate of 3 %, which was incorrect because a portion of the interest was at 2 % and another portion was to be at 3 % according to the terms of the HAMP modification. Additionally, your employee XXXX signed off on the affidavit asserting he had reviewed the account and the amounts calculated were factual. This is a violation of FDCPA 15 U.S.C, 1692e ( 2 ), UNFAIR PRACTICES, "" the false representation of the character, amount or legal status of any debt '' and FDCPA 15 USC 1692f ( 1 ) "" The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law '' 9. What date did BOA file and pay the required mortgage mediation fee? 
10. What exactly is BOA doing to expedite the foreclosure? Please provide detail, dates, etc. 
Please be advised this is my second request and I will continue to escalate this matter and write to the CFPB until each and every one of my questions is answered."
Mortgage,"Entered into subprime mortgage with Countrywide. Had a motorcycle accident. Immediately contacted HUD/FHA for mortgage relief while injured ( could not go to work, financial hardship ). Contacted by BofA regarding my requests. Sent to numerous mortgage counseling programs and representatives of different departments within BofA, all to no avail. BofA disregarded my qualified written requests as of why they were dual-tracking my mortgage and were deficient in providing me with mortgage foreclosure relief at the same time. In violation of RESPA, BofA never responded, but continued forward with their foreclosure actions by and through their attorneys XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Illinois."
Mortgage,"I am a XXXX-year old retired male living with my XXXX-year-old wife in XXXX, Virginia. Since XXXX XXXX we, as joint owners, have been faithfully paying a 30-year mortgage loan with Bank of America ( BOA ) Home Loans, which acquired Countrywide Home Loans in XXXX. Currently the principal balance is {$77000.00}. During the course of the mortgage we have had several issues with BOA concerning the escrow account ( taxes & insurance ), which monies are paid to BOA from our total monthly mortgage payment of {$900.00}. Currently the monthly escrow amount is {$140.00}. 

In XXXX our then-monthly mortgage payment of {$1100.00} was reduced nearly $ XXXX/month, largely due to a reduction of our XXXX XXXX County property/real estate taxes under the county 's Tax Relief Program for XXXX and XXXX Persons. Also, in XXXX XXXX, BOA sent us a check for {$2300.00} for "" escrow overage. '' However, this month, XXXX, XXXX, BOA sent us an Escrow Account Review statement in which BOA established a new monthly escrow payment of {$280.00}. No stated reason for the increase, however the statement applied ( added ) our annual county taxes of {$990.00} TWICE. We do not know why BOA sees fit to increase our escrow payments or why our county taxes are applied twice. However, BOA sends to us about twice a month offers to refinance our mortgage. Which we do not want, especially because our monthly mortgage payment is more manageable due to the county tax reductions. 

We are left to think that, perhaps, BOA is attempting to recoup the escrow overage check money by increasing our escrow monies owed, in addition to to pestering us to refinance, which we believe would be far more beneficial to BOA than to us, especially since our principal payments are now reducing the total amount owed on a par with the interest charges. 

As things stand now, we consider BOA 's escrow increase to be arbitrary and without merit and wish clarification of BOA 's intentions under its Escrow Account Review."

Mortgage,"Since the beginning of this year, I have received three Escrow Account Disclosure Statement Notice of New Mortgage Payment. One dated XX/XX/XXXX, another dated XX/XX/XXXX and the last one dated XX/XX/XXXX. After receiving all three statements, I have had to call into your Customer Service department to find point out discrepancies with my account. 

The errors have been as follows per Statements XX/XX/XXXX 1. Shortfall {$490.00} when my XX/XX/XXXX statement listed an Escrow Surplus of {$83.00} 2. Adding an XX/XX/XXXX payment for {$420.00} for my stand-alone Flood Insurance Policy. First, I am not required to have it and XX/XX/XXXX was my 1st year securing the policy and paid for out-of-pocket. 
3. Misc. Post on XX/XX/XXXX for - {$780.00} with no explanation ever received 4. As I attempted to modify my loan after my XX/XX/XXXX Hurricane Forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX and was put into a Trial Modification, I overpaid my loan during the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX because whenever I called in my payments your system would only allow me to pay {$1200.00}. I was only obligated to pay {$1100.00} per month, so my total overpayment was {$150.00} and can not tell where its been applied to my account. 

XX/XX/XXXX 1. Does not reflect the {$17.00} Inspection Fee paid over the phone and never done on XX/XX/XXXX Confirmation # XXXX. 
2. Projected Paid section still showed Flood Insurance XX/XX/XXXX for {$420.00} 3. XX/XX/XXXX Actual of overage {$130.00} and a check was out to me XX/XX/XXXX 1. Monthly payment increased from {$1100.00} to {$1500.00} effective for XX/XX/XXXX. I noticed a large increase in the monthly portion of my insurance going from {$91.00} per month to {$390.00} and I do not understand how you came up with this number. Last year, my homeowners premium was {$1000.00} and this year the premiums increased to {$1100.00}. On, XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed an extra escrow payment to over the difference, Check # XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX for {$110.00}, in order to keep my monthly payments from increasing. 
2. On your Projected Escrow activity over next 12 month, you recorded payments of {$1100.00} to my homeowners insurance XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX even though you paid a payment already on XX/XX/XXXX. 
3. It does not show the overage paid to me back in XX/XX/XXXX of {$130.00} 4. {$17.00} Inspection Fee charged me and was never done 5. {$150.00} overpayments for the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke with XXXX in Customer Service, he corrected the errors, and supposedly my payments were returned to {$1100.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. I also requested an updated Escrow Statement to confirm the changes. On XX/XX/XXXX, when I logged back into my account, the payment was back to {$1500.00}. This time I spoke with XXXX in XXXX who stated because you only received my binder agreement and not the full copy of my insurance policy, the change was undone. I faxed over the 75-pages of the  agreement myself and finally when I logged back in a few days later, my payments was back to {$1100.00}. 

Now I have my XX/XX/XXXX statement and once again, it says I have to pay {$1500.00}. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX in XXXX. I requested an escalation, as I am tired of constantly having to call in or write about one problem or another in regards to my account and was given Reference # XXXX, and told I would receive a call back within 24 to 48 hours. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message from XXXX, Senior Client Advocate at XXXX XXXX   while I was at work with a call back ( XXXX ) XXXX. When I attempted to call her back, I got a regular Customer Service Rep XXXX, who once again gave me the same line about how you were reanalyzing my account and someone would get back to me. 

As of today, Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I have not gotten any resolutions to the problem with my escrow causing my monthly payments increase over {$330.00} per month. I DO NOT have an extra {$330.00} per month to pay for my mortgage and you are aware of this due to my recent failed attempt to modification my loan earlier this year after the hurricane forbearance. Most importantly, I DO NOW OWE YOU an additional {$330.00} per month. I feel as if you are on a quest to foreclose on my loan by making my payments unaffordable. I already had to take an early emergency withdrawal from my 401k to pay the three forbearance months to bring my loan current so you would have no reasons to take away my home. 

Please correct this error once and for and in time for me to make the proper payment for XX/XX/XXXX."
Mortgage,"i was denied a home loan modification by bank of america. they are the loan servicer for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. i had to fill out a separate XXXX XXXX XXXX financials. I am in bankruptcy ch XXXX for the 4th time as the judge allowed it due to a hardship. my son passed away in XX/XX/2017 due to a XXXX XXXX, his 7th and final. My wife found the body. We both have XXXX, but my wife has XXXX. We were asked for a hardship letter describing details, probably focousing in the mental aspect versus the sever monetary issues that developed due to these many issues. 
In the denial letter they stated that my income was not enough to support anything besides a short sale. When i asked them what level they were using, and what level would make it work they said they could NOT provide me that information."
Mortgage,"I opened a Bank of America home equity line of credit in XXXX for the amount of {$12000.00}. I have been paying on this loan for almost 20 years, it still shows that I have a balance of almost {$4000.00}. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my credit report and looked under closed accounts and saw that the Bank of America account was closed in XXXX. However, I never received any notification or documentation of changes to my account. Last month, on XX/XX/XXXX, I logged onto my account to make a payment of {$100.00}. I tried to login today and I received a message saying they were unable to process my request because there are no eligible accounts associated with my ID, even though I did not change anything. So, it is clear that something has gone on with my account that I am not aware of, and I have been making payments for all these years. Also, the fact that I still owe this amount of money after close to 20 years of payment, is ridiculous!"
Mortgage,"I have a loan with Bank of America. At the beginning of XX/XX/2020, Bank of America assessed a {$5.00} fee on my mortgage, without giving any reason. Whats more, they marked this {$5.00} as past due, probably with the intention to rush me into paying at as soon as possible. Since its just {$5.00}, I paid without asking why. 

And then they got greedy. At the end of XX/XX/2020, they, once again, charged my mortgage with {$5.00}, also called it past due, without giving any reason. 

This despicable practice of Bank of America deserves a serious investigation."
Mortgage,"We applied for a home mortgage refinancing with BoA XX/XX/XXXX. After we locked in a market rate, they continually reappraised our home. They continually rejected appraisals until they received a low appraisal and then charged us {$6300.00} of closing cost points because we had become a "" high-risk '' asset mortgage. 
The appraisal they eventually accepted was XXXX - XXXX % below the other appraisals that they rejected until they received one appraisal that forced us to pay points. Since interest rates increased over loan processing time, we had to pay the {$6300.00} of points. 
BoA said they have no influence over appraisal selection due to Dodd Frank, but they kept rejecting "" independent '' appraisals until they found one low enough to force us to pay points. 
I spoke to the appraisers whose appraisals were rejected and they told me the appraisals were over XXXX % higher than the one low-ball that BoA eventually accepted. From BoA here was no explanation of the rejections, only constant streams of appraisers flowing through our house until they finally found an appraisal XXXX % below market that forced us to pay points. I tried to speak with BoA management. They never called to explain the multiple rejected appraisals or the assignment of points."
Mortgage,"In 2010 I applied for a loan modification. During the 'trial ' period I was given a payment amount to make and I paid each and every payment on time and complete as agreed until the modification was approved on XXXX/XXXX/2010. I have recently discovered that Bank of America has been reporting me as having late payments and this has had a negative effect on my credit score, dragging it down, according to my current servicer, to XXXX. I never made a single payment late nor did I pay a late charge. I recently disputed this through XXXX of the credit reporting services but Bank of America has refused to correct it. At the time I applied for the modification I was told that it would not effect my credit as long as I made the required payments. In checking the .gov relative to the modification I found that BOA was not supposed to have reported me as delinquent. I would like for you to handle this before I need an attorney. I believe that I am not the only victim of BOA in this and BOA should be investigated for this practice."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has taken nearly 2.5 months to close my loan. For the first week I asked them if I needed to hire a lawyer for this process and it took nearly 5 days and me elevating to a supervisor to get an answer. During the documentation process I was asked repeatedly for documentation I already submitted, documentation that bank of america already has on file such as Escrow statments, deposit information ... During the appraisal process they never ordered the appraisal in a reasonable time and it took me calling and asking about it for them to realize that it was never ordered. Bank of America has asked me multiple time to reach out to both the closing lawyer ( their lawyer ) as well as mine to see if I can make them go any faster. For the ridiculous amount of money I am paying for this loan I feel I have done more work than anyone else. During the scheduling of closing they repeatedly asked my closing lawyer for information that he already sent to them as well as information that is never provided by the buyers lawyer and must be provided by the lawyer they hired for closing. This has been an incredibly stressful situation for both the buyers and sellers of the property."
Mortgage,"This is another follow up complaint against Bank of America. This complaint is continual and linked to CFPB # XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. To date, Bank of America has not accurately updated the status of these loans, which were settled via Short Sale XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached a copy of a portion of my XXXX credit report showing the misleading and confusing status of these loans. It also shows incorrect High Credit Balance for the second mortgage of over XXXX dollars which is not only incorrect, it is outrageous. I need Bank of America to update their credit reporting of these loans to reflect that the loans were settled in full and there is no balance. I also need them to reflect an accurate High Credit Balance. I need them to update these information with all Credit Reporting Bureaus asap."
Mortgage,"am filling a complaint against Bank of America , NA for the deceitful, dishonest, lies and corrupt, method which They unlawfully auctioned my property on XXXX XXXX, 2016 it was an illegal sale, It has gone back to their XXXX XXXX I found very serious violation in the process of transfer of my loan there was no Assignments, Substitution or Substitution of Trustee ever recorded in the County in which my property is located. it clearly states in the California Civil Codes Regulation proper recording of documents"
Mortgage,"I 'm trying to get a copy of a mortgage discharge from XXXX XXXX XXXX that 's out of business. XXXX XXXX XXXX 's parent company, Nations Bank, is owned by Bank of America. I was advised by B of A to contact XXXX at XXXX. This number is voice mail only and after leaving numerous messages over several months they will not call me. The mortgage was taken out by my parents."
Mortgage,"There are a few incidents that occured with the VA loan I have through Bank of America : The first incident happened in XX/XX/XXXX. The escrow on my house payment increased from roughly {$1200.00} to {$1300.00}. Bank of America states that they mailed a letter to the address on file, warning me of this increase. However, I never received a letter. At that time, I was going through a separation. My ex-husband 's attorney had his address changed with BOA. Therefore, those letters were forwarded to him, which he never received, because he was in XXXX, serving his country. XX/XX/XXXX comes and goes, and per usual, my automatic payment drafted {$1200.00} from my account. Same with XX/XX/XXXX. By the end of that month, I got an email from my ex that our account was delinquent. I called BOA and found out that the escrow increased, and since my payment was over {$50.00} shy of the full payment, it was not counted as such. How'd they fix it? They took part of my XX/XX/XXXX payment and put it towards XX/XX/XXXX, which now made my XX/XX/XXXX payment over {$100.00} short. A {$50.00} late fee was added to each month. Once I called and paid my account in full, and then explained that my father passed away that month, I was, at least, able to get the late fees removed. However, they said they were unable to fix my ex-husband 's and my credit score. My ex has a top-secret security clearance that was almost stripped from him, because of this. Not knowing what else to do, I had to let it go. 

After all of that, I have a few questions ... 
1 ) Why weren't the letters sent to the parcel address?

2 ) Why-in-the-world was my ex-husband 's attorney allowed to access MY mortgage account? She wanted notification if I fell behind on payments, and they granted it to her. My ex isn't able to make any changes, yet his attorney can? He can't make changes, because someone at BOA entered his Social Security Number incorrectly. They won't let either of us fix it, because we can't tell them which number is wrong. 
3 ) If his SSN is wrong on the account, how was his credit affected? 

Then, a big THEN, on XX/XX/XXXX, my automatic payment of {$1300.00}, titled "" XX/XX/XXXX Paid To - Bac Home Loans Online Pmt Chk XXXX '' was cleared. A few days later, I received an email from Bank of America stating that I missed my last payment and am now deemed delinquent on my account. I thought "" No WAY ''! I searched through my bank account and confirmed that my payment had been made to BOA, and on time. However, I did notice a new transaction -- a DEPOSIT, reading "" XX/XX/XXXX Deposit - ACH Paid From Bank Of America Pmt Refund XXXX ''. A {$1300.00} deposit to be exact. I called Bank of America, and they told me that it must have been an issue with my bank, because they wouldn't refund a mortgage payment. They told me that I must not have had the proper funds, therefore, my bank didn't send payment. I said, "" absolutely NOT ''! 1 ) I have a {$2000.00} over-draft protection plan, and 2 ) it said BOA REFUND! They told me the only thing I could do is make a new payment. So, I did. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my mortgage for the SECOND time that month. They still charged me a late fee, and said there was nothing they could do to fix my credit score now, because I had no proof that it was refunded. I have proof. I told them I could provide them my bank statements. They didn't care. 

My credit score used to sit comfortably in the 800s ... after that, it plummeted to the 500s!! I am attempting to refinance my house, as part of my divorce. However, with this on my credit, I won't be able to afford it, let alone be offered a loan with a new bank. Also, did I mention, my final divorce decree states that if I am late, THREE times, on a mortgage, them my ex can take the house from me. Due to these incidents, I have already reached the MAX. Please, help me fix this! If BOA had chosen to help, this could have easily been remedied in house. However, they have continuously told me there is nothing they can do to correct their mistakes."
Mortgage,"I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have a mortgage through Bank of America ( originated with Countrywide Homeloans ) ( Acct # XXXX ). My mortgage has faithfully been paid via allotment from my retired pay by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 

Bank of America ( after several calls ) informed me that they no longer accept allotments from XXXX, effective XX/XX/2020 ( NOTE : they did accept my XXXX XXXX, 2020 payment ). I don't recall receiving notice of this change, but I certainly could have missed it and don't dispute that element of the story. 

Payments were made by XXXX on XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 in the amount of {$1400.00} each. Neither payment was posted against my mortgage, thus leaving me 2 months in arrears. I will send a check to cover those two months, but the {$2800.00} is lost. Bank of America says that XXXX should have it ; XXXX says they sent it and it has not been returned. Bank of America claims that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  acts as an intermediary for XXXX and that the money was not forwarded to them. XXXX says that they don't work through an intermediary bank and that allotments are sent directly to the bank as requested by the retiree. No one I speak with seems to have a clue.

Mortgage,"I was a victim of a predatory loan and actually still am. I have tried to get Bank of America to modifiy my loan since XXXX on only wanted them to reduce my 2nd Loan that is a 9 % interest rate to current market or the same as my 1st loan which is a 3.5 %. I tried 3 times and every time Bank of America would say they could not help because the 2nd loan was from another bank and they have to follow strict guidelines and if the 2nd loan was with Bank of America they would be able to help. On XXXX XXXX I received notification that Bank of America was going to be taking over my 2nd loan which was great news because now Bank of America can finally help me. When attempting to get a refinance or modification they game another excuse. I had no choice but to file a small claims lawsuit against Bank of America, while in court the Judge was in my favor in poor practice however the reason the Judge dismissed my case without prejudice. Is because Bank of America representative expressed that my modification process was still active and not closed. I informed the Judge that was not the case however I had no evidence to prove that. I called Bank of America modification department and received confirmation that my modification was closed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and which showed that Bank of America lied in court.

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2020, I applied for a VA mortgage through Bank of America. I provided all the requested information and was initially given a tentative closing date. Within a few weeks I was being sent more paperwork that needed to be revised almost daily. The paperwork was not pertaining to any major issues but things such as signing each page of pest control report by seller and buyer, mandating that these signatures could not be electronically signed but had to be wet signatures. Requests were made for information from my inspector and appraiser which they had never heard of before and both parties have worked in their respective fields for more than 30 years. We were requested to send proof that home repairs listed in contract had been done by licensed plumber and electrician however when the realtors sent the information, they were told the licenses could not be verified and that they were probably fake by an underwriting agent. It was more than a nightmare and there were no reasonable explanation as to why we were getting the runaround. There were also other questionable actions by the underwriting department we were working with as well as the loan officer. I was told my interest rate could not be changed once it was locked in and I was also told that I could not convert from. VA loan to  a Conventional loan even if I qualified. I changed from Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and closed with a new mortgage company on XX/XX/XXXX. They stated they didnt understand why Bank of America was not able to do the same, the new mortgage company stated I had one of the cleanest file they had seen in awhile. My hopes is that my treatment had nothing to do with anything except the fact that there are persons employed at Bank of America who do not desire to do their job when having limited supervision and working from home but, I could not risk anyone having to endure what I did with Bank of America, regardless of the motivating factor. I wrote a letter of complaint to XXXX XXXX at the following address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ga XXXX on XX/XX/2020. I have also attempted to reach an underwriting supervisor to file a complaint and was transferred from department to department without successfully reaching anyone.

3. New requirements were asked of me to included certain additional insurance coverages that was NEVER required from the inception of the loan.

4. Before the sale of my loan BOA changed the terms of the loan over the phone that has adversely affected my ability to get a flat verses variable rate for NO reason. 

I only owe XXXX on a house worth XXXX .... yet these folks are forcing me out of my home."
Mortgage,"My bank will not cancel my PMI on a 30 year conventional loan despite a proper request. I first requested it be cancelled several years ago and I understood I had to have 20 % equity. We paid about {$500.00} for an appraisal and it was around the 20 % equity threshold. We received a letter rejecting our request from the bank stating we needed 25 % equity. Where did this arbitrary threshold come from? We had no known recourse. 

Second, I recently again requested PMI be cancelled. We paid about {$500.00} for a 2nd appraisal and this time we clearly have at least 20 % equity. However, in the interim, and for the first time ever in the almost 10 years I 've had this loan, we accidently paid the mortgage 1 day late. Let me explain - my daughter was very ill and we were focused on that and did n't pay on time. I realized the error on the last day of the month ( payment is late if it is not paid by the end of the month due ) and called the mortgage company to explain what happened and went online and paid that day when it was still timely. However, it was already in the evening and the payment could not be processed until the following day, making the payment 1 day late. Based on paying 1 day late we now have to wait an entire year before we can again request PMI can be cancelled so that we have a year of on time payments. I called the bank and asked them to reconsider as a courtesy and explained it was a one-time error due to extreme family circumstances ; I posted a payment timely, called to explain the situation and explained the situation online, but the payment did n't process until the following day. They declined and are still requiring we continue to pay PMI. 

Through paying for 2 appraisals and the continued cost of the PMI for at least another year, we are out about {$2200.00}."
Mortgage,"My mortgage has gone into foreclosure due to a separation/divorce. At the time my husband left I was only working part time and could not afford the payments. I have since obtained full time employment. He has walked away from the loan. He has no contact with the bank and does n't care if the house forecloses. I have tried everything I can to work something out with Bank of America. I call them weekly, applied for a modification, and even saved the past due amount to reinstate the loan. To my dismay, they pushed forward with a foreclosure and filed judgement against me in local court. The are requesting additional information from my husband, which he would not provide because he does not want the loan anymore. I offered to pay the bank to reinstate the loan. They sent me reinstatement figures. There were XXXX of dollars in fees attached in addition to the past due amount of the loan. I asked for a detailed listing of the fees. They would not provide them to me. I was told by my Bank of America Customer Relations Manager to contact the attorney handling the foreclosure to obtain a breakdown of their fees. When I contacted the attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX of XXXX, PA, The amount to reinstate was completely different and a lot less than the bank was telling me. The woman at the attorney office told me I could send payment to them directly and the loan would be reinstated. I contacted the bank again, they denied this was an option. The told me to forward payment to them. I asked the amount needed to reinstate. I was given another estimate. Completely different again. It had gone down from the first quote, but was still higher than the attorney. They told me this was due to "" estimated '' charges. I asked for a breakdown of these charges. They can not provide that to me. They told me to pay the amount by XXXX XXXX or they are filing for a Sheriff Sale date in my county. I have told them again and again I do not have the {$13000.00} or the {$11000.00} needed to reinstate that they want. I can pay the past due amount, the {$9700.00} for my back payments and have asked to make other arrangements to pay back the "" fees ''. They refuse to accept the payment. They want the full amount they keep telling me. I asked why foreclosure went through when I was trying to get a modification. They could not answer me. Bank of America was requesting additional documents they told me. Every time I call I get a different person with a different answer. Bank of America is telling me it 's the lender, FHA, that 's requiring the full amount to reinstate, yet the amount changes every time I call. It 's like they want to foreclose on the loan and are not willing to help me save it."
Mortgage,"Paid mortgage off on XX/XX/2022 of {$28000.00} to Bank of America after numerous problems with the crediting my account correctly. I have been trying to contact them regarding my deed and paperwork showing I paid off the mortgage. Every time I contact BoA and no matter what time of the day, I am unable to speak with anyone. The virtual assistance keep saying they are closed after saying the business hours are XXXX as the business hours. The times called is well within those hours. I've tried more than dozen times. I need these document for personal reasons and I've paid the mortgage off in good grace, so I should be given my documents without begging for them."
Mortgage,"I filed a complaint against Bank of America Credit Card - Visa in   XXXX    because of severe security problems with their credit card. I decided to reduce my financial foot print with Bank of America because of this issue and a problem in  XXXX , where I opened a Traditional IRA and they opened a Roth IRA by mistake, potentially causing a serious problem with my tax filing if I had not read the fine print. At that time, I emptied my saving account of most funds because of their tolerance for such a large margin of error. In   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , I closed my credit card and saving account and moved my direct deposit from my employer to another financial institution (   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ). At the same time, I moved the direct debit for my Bank of America Mortgage to   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   to pay my mortgage from this other account. On  XX/XX/XXXX , I received a notice from Bank of America Mortgage that I am behind on paying my mortgage. However, the debits from my   XXXX   XXXX   account are clear and are attached in an account statement. However, the Bank of America statement reports that they performed an "" unapplied funds reversal. '' The reversed funds states it left my bank of america mortgage account on  XX/XX/XXXX , but was not returned to my other financial institution from which it was debited, nor was it returned to the only remaining account with Bank of America, which is the remaining checking account ( which was the account the mortgage was previously debited from ). My wife now uses this account. So in essence they claimed they reversed {$920.00}, but they did not do so to my accounts and are sending me a notice that my account is past due and at risk for a late fee. I have tried to contact them twice but the prompts on the Customer service number do not progress to resolution. They confirm that payment was received. I believe this may  be institutional retaliation for the previous complaint. I have never missed a payment."
Mortgage,In XXXX my subdivision had floods and affected XXXX of the houses. we could not get any one to buy our property so we put it on short-sale. The bank did not approve the sale and instead initiated a foreclosure sale on the property. in XXXX XXXX the property was fore-closed. later the XXXX mortgage was reported on our credit report as unsecured loan with each month reporting late. we have tried to resolve with the Bank but they have continued to say we owe them on the XXXX mortgage.
Mortgage,"I have been a loyal Bank of America client for over 10 years. I have been a Preferred Rewards Diamond member for 5 years. XX/XX/2023 late in the evening, my Realtor asked for an FHA pre approval letter. I filled out my information online hoping to get the approval letter quickly to give to my realtor. After submitting my information, to my disappointment they were giving loan suggestions and it became clear it was not pre approval but a sales tactic. I get a phone call from a Bank of America representative XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  : XXXX who proceeds to ask the exact same questions for about XXXX minutes about questions that I already had answered. Then I get put on hold for XXXX minutes and told I didn't qualify. I could buy the house in cash many times over but I didn't have the proper flow of income for the loan. The representative then sold off my information as a lead to hundreds if not thousands of mortgage brokers without my consent. I've received hundreds of phone calls within the last XXXX hours ( have screenshots of XXXX ) about a security instrument that I don't qualify for. I am considering moving all of my funds to a different company since this incident. I am extremely disappointed with the the way I was treated throughout this entire process as someone who had dedicated faith in the company."
Mortgage,"Back about close to 15 years I had modified through Bank old America. I had a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. The house was under financially over XXXX. They modified the 80 % loan, and were suppose to write off the 20 % which was a little over XXXX. The 80 % loan was a little over XXXX this modified. The 20 % loan shows with Bank of America the account was closed or I did not have to pay them. They were very deceitful on the modification. Years later they sold the bad debt to a company that was owned by them or sister company by Bank of America. As time has gone by they sold to other collection agencies such as XXXX. Now almost 15 years later my house is in foreclosure. They said compound interest of what was XXXX now is close to XXXX. They say if I dont pay they will for close. They have address or my home XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, California, XXXX on XXXX under Foreclosure. The young lady who modified loan for me told me to contact you and the Attorney XXXX I did. I need help since I have a wife and a mother in law who has XXXX that I support financially. My wife cant work since she care for my mother in law. She stopped working in XXXX. Since I dont know law or barley make ends meet to hire an attorney I am desperately seeking our organization and Attorney general before I go public with this dishonest company. I know Bank of America was paid to modify loan which they refused to help by giving me the runaround, so I hired an outside company who took it out of foreclosure but failed to modify. Then I hired another company to modify, which she did. XXXX Bank of America accepted modification, but failed to write off the amount that made the mortgage under value market. They secretly sold the bad debt and it has been sold from hand to hand."
Mortgage,"First Fact : Bank of America National Association requested an "" Assignment of Deed of Trust '' on my second Mortgage For value received, the undersigned holder of a Deed of Trust whose address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX. The Assignment of Deed of Trust was recorded on XX/XX/2012. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. is the undersigned holder of a Deed of Trust. See Attached Assignment Deed of Trust.

Concern : This request for Assignment Deed of Trust was filed shortly after the Judge of the Superior Court of California ruled that Bank of America had to remove my Ex-Wife 's name ( XXXX XXXX ) from all and any financial documents. Bank of America National Association has yet to execute on the judgment. Also, The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address is a single family residence, please see photo as proof that The XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX business does not reside at the address on The Assignment of Deed of Trust. The Assignment of Deed of Trust in question in this complaint is the second mortgage. See Attached Amended Stipulated Judgement.

Fact : XXXX XXXX XXXX somehow manipulated the servicing of my mortgage. There is no recorded record of XXXX being the Trustee of my Deed of Trust and can't produce a verification of mortgage. When requesting a copy of the 1st Mortgage Deed of Trust, XXXX sent me a photo copy they downloaded from a third party source and presented it to me on copied paper that was distorted and dated with page assignments of 1of13 and 1of18. 1of13 would of been my Deed of Trust. See attached document I received from XXXX through a request I made online of the 1st Mortgage.

Fact : XXXX XXXX XXXX does not allow me to have access to my second mortgage information. The web site does not show the loan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX will not send my any of the account information I have requested. When I called XXXX recently, they were able to find my loan information in their system. The told me me that loan was liquidated in XX/XX/2015 and has a XXXX Balance. I received a letter from XXXX stating that they made a business decision to cease collection on this account in a letter dated XX/XX/2018.See attached. In the same letter the say : "" however, we have not released the lien ''. To me this means they are in the process of releasing the lien? I am confused because there is no lien where XXXX is the trustee or holder? When Bank of America requested that The Assignment of Deed of Trust be transferred to MERS, does this mean that it is transferring the Deed of Trust to XXXX for the second Mortgage? See attached Letter dated XX/XX/2018.

Fact : Please see attached payment history of the first mortgage, note that there are entries that suggest large amount of money posted to a new loan set up on XX/XX/2012, right around the time Bank of America requested the Assignment of Deed of Trust to MERS. The amount was for the {$580000.00}. Then the principal balance dropped to {$99000.00} on XX/XX/2018? These numbers just don't add up? See attached accounting sheets for the 1st Mortgage XXXX ( XXXX Loan Number ).

I would like some explanation on why XXXX feels they are Trustee of my Deed of Trust for my Second and First Mortgages. I would like a full reconveyance of both liens. The second mortgage lien needs to be released due to the fact the loan has been liquidated with XXXX Balance.

Thank you XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"Bank of America is not crediting my HELOC payments although I have sent the payments of {$570.00} on XX/XX/2023 and {$310.00} on XX/XX/2023, which is properly applied would mean I was current. When they called me threatening foreclosure for nonpayment last month, after I gave proof, BoA informed me that it had located the funds placed into the wrong account and that BoA would return the payments to my checking account so I could make the payments to the correct ( according to them ) account. Please know that I have had this HELCO with Bo for over a decade of years and have made my payments each month to the same account. Because my bank was recently sold to a new bank in XX/XX/2023 and thought the transfer of my accounts to the new bank was part of the problem ; I was willing to cut BoA some slack and waited patiently for the return of my funds. However, as of today I have not seen the funds returned to my checking account So, when BoA called me today informing me that it has placed my home in foreclosure because its records show I have missed 3 payments ; I got really piss-off. 

BoA has my funds and is using the excuse that it went to the wrong account to start the foreclosure process to take my home. Also, my credit score has declined by XXXX points due to BOA 's negative reporting."
Mortgage,"Your attention to this complain is very essential and must need investigated and brought to proper authorities for further investigation and possible prosecution. Perhaps to the General Attorney 's office who does handle discrimination cases. 
Initially my complaint filed with your agency complaint # XXXX all the facts was outlined. I also filed with another agency complaining the same time which that agency forwarded to you for further valuation and handling. The second complaint was filed under # XXXX. Today after checking the status in your website the Bank of America closed both complaints without given any explanation other than have the consumer contacting us and a phone number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX-XXXX X XXXX All these are calculated plans to avoid and instead come clean.

Mortgage,"I have gotten a divorce and my ex had taken out XXXX credit cards using my financial information. They want me to get her name off the mortgage now.

I then had to go to getting a Loan Assumption because the credit cards the ex had gotten and not paid were now dropping my credit below XXXX. Bank of America told me credit rating was n't an issue with the assumption since I was already on the mortgage. They were more focused on ability of repayment, which my attorney, work comp, and Long Term XXXX carrier all sent necessary papers covering that. Then Bank of America sent me a denial letter stating my credit was n't good enough for them. They lied to me. I am about to lose the only home I have and worked for, for 30 years.

Mortgage,"As a first time home buyer who relied on Countrywide and their so called honest eputation and experience, took out our first mortgage loan with them in XXXX XXXX.

After filling out the paper work and getting the keys in which we had to run them down for in XXXX, XXXX, my family and I were caught in between a scandal with Countrywide. We later found out it became public in XXXX which was two months after purchasing the house. 
My husband and I signed our lives away with hundreds of documents from Countrywide with the asking price of {$380000.00} with monthly payments as low as {$1400.00}. We never received the final documents, because we were told that they would be mailed out to us via XXXX. Two months went by and we never received anything. I called and called Countrywide there was no answer or no response from them. It 's like they never existed. 
Finally we started getting threating and unprofessional calls from Bank of America. We were told by one of the representatives from Bank of America that the house was {$460000.00} with monthly payments of almost {$4000.00}. I was in disbelief and was told from the Bank of America employee "" You are old enough to know better. '' I then asked to speak to a supervisor whom I thought would be more sympathetic, passionate and with a little more experience. But boy was I wrong. The supervisor was more harsh then the first Bank of America representative. She advised me to do what I had to do or go get an attorney. They were only there to collect their monthly mortgage payments and that was it. 
We were then forced to re-modify our loan due to difficulty making payments and when we did re-modify and were approved. They approved it for {$4.00} dollars less than the original loan which was {$3800.00} dollars.

Mortgage,"This is a up of Complaint Number XXXX filed XXXX XXXX. 
This is also a follow up of XXXX XXXX filed XXXX XXXX. 
This is my third filing of this complaint. 

Bank of America has violated Federal Law. 

Federally regulated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX   Loans have very specific guidelines for areas effected by natural disaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) designated our area eligible for individual assistance. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) also provides information on these guidelines. According to the Federal guidelines all XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX back loans within a FEMA designated disaster area ( hurricane IRM ) are eligible for forbearance for up to 12 months, no late fees, no delinquencies reported to the credit bureaus and no requirement to catch up on mortgage payments after forbearance. 

Bank of America has not followed these Federal Guideline. 

XX/XX/XXXX letter from Bank of America clearly states that they would have a resolution to this issue by XXXX XXXX. This was a letter in response from the second complaint. Nothing has been resolved. 

XXXX XXXX my 3th dedicated CRM manager XXXX XXXX was assigned ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX were my previous ) XX/XX/XXXX defines that the loan is under review for the Special Forbearance Plan ( SFB ) and the state that it is under review for Capitalize and Extended modification plan. Nothing has happened. 

XXXX XXXX Mortgage Statement clearly requires me to pay the full amount of {$5500.00}. Also note that I am being charge a late fee under Explanation of Total Amount Due which is a violation of the Federal Guideline. 

XX/XX/XXXX I made my normal payment of {$1300.00}. The payment was accepted. 

XXXX XXXX I am assigned my 4th CRM XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX I received a letter that clearly stated that I owe the entire amount of {$4100.00}. This is a violation of the Federal Guidelines. 

XXXX XXXX Mortgage Statement clearly requires me to pay the full amount of {$5600.00}. Also note that I am being charge a late fee. 

XX/XX/XXXX I am assigned my 5th CRM XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX I made my normal payment of {$1300.00}. The payment was accepted. 

XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement clearly stating that I now own {$5700.00}. 

XXXX XXXX I made my normal payment of {$1300.00}. The payment was held. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating that they received my payment of {$1300.00} and that this amount was being held in an unapplied funds account. The letter contradicts itself by clearly stating that my full monthly contractual monthly payment if {$1300.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX I just received Mortgage State that clearly requires me to pay {$5800.00}. This is a violation of Federal Guidelines. 

Over the course of the past three months I have received various phone calls from one of the many CRM 's assigned to the case. They have told me various stories that I am sure are recorded. They have told me they will Capitalize and Extend and nothing happens. I have been assigned 5 CRM 's and when I return the call they all say they are working on it. My last conversation with a CRM or whoever it is this week told me I was going to be put on a trail payment plan. I have yet to see any information on this plan. 

Bank of America violated Federal Guidelines. 

This is my third complaint. Nothing is happening and Bank of America just continues to violate Federal Guidelines. They never follow up on my complaints they just produce a letter that says that they are working on responding to my complaint. 

I want to the CFPB to open an investigation. I am a consumer and at this time I feel that my rights under The US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Consumer Credit Protection Act,  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and FEMA are being violated and I want Bank of America to be held accountable. 

If this complaint is not resolved within 15 business day I will be forced to present these violations with copies of the CFPB complaints to the : Federal Reserve : Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Division of Consumer and Community Affairs XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, DC XXXX Furthermore I have reached out to the my attorney to discuss filing of complaint in the form of a lawsuit with the : United State District Court XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX"
Mortgage,"I have had our mortgage for over 20 years and ever since Bank of America took over our original mortgage company Countrywide, I have had on going issues. I have been trying to be able to prepay more than one periodic payment without it being applied to principal balance of the loan. I want to be able to make payments as often as I choose and for the life of the loan. 
I have spoken on the phone with the main customer service several times over the years. They would post my payments incorrectly. Each time I spoke to someone, I was given different instructions and was told flat out that I could not make additional payments at any time or make prepayments. With no explanation or help. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke on separate occasions to 2 agents XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). They both said that Bank of Americas policy was not allow early payments. Frustrated, I spoke to the Bank of America XXXX, XXXX branch manager. She tried to help, so it seemed, but nothing was resolved. 

Another phone call to customer service, I mentioned the clause I found in my statement below. I was told to mail a written request. Which I did on XX/XX/XXXX and have yet to receive a response or resolution. 

Paying your loan ahead You may prepay your periodic payments one month in advance. If you want to prepay more than one periodic payment, please contact us. Keep in mind that if you dont contact us or we dont receive written instruction from you, and you attempt to prepay more than one periodic payment, we will apply those payments to the principal balance of the loan. 

Then I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, regarding our homeowners insurance premiums. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the phone number XXXX listed on the letter to get some clarification. The recent letter was notification that Bank Of America paid our homeowners insurance premiums on our previous and current insurance policies, so youll need to cancel one of them and send us your premium refund. What did this mean??? 
First thought was, did our homeowners policy company change? SecondIf so, why were we not notified? Then of course confusion and so many other questions and concerns came up. After speaking to someone about this, she confirmed that our homeowners insurance policy holder was not changed and the last payment was XXXX. And that its all caught up and that the letter must have been sent in error. 
So, I asked the XXXX  lady about my previous issue. I explained all to her and she gave me another address to which I can send my concerns and complaints. I am sending it certified mail Monday XX/XX/XXXX. In the letter I advised them that I was also filing a claim with you. 
Every time I try to work with this bank, I have issues. Everyones hands are tied, employees are uninformed or show lack of knowledge of policies, XXXX etc. And no communication. So very frustrating and aggravating."
Mortgage,"Bank of America filed a fraudulent lien during financing of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX ; XXXX VA XXXX. Double liens were filed, and when alerted about it, Bank of America is not taking any action to correct the lien status"
Mortgage,"We have a home in XXXX, XXXX that we purchased almost 10 years ago. We lived there for 2-3 years before we relocated to XXXX for a new job. We then put the house up for sale but due to the housing market plummet we were unable to sell the home and had to rent it. Then due to financial hardships including unemployment we had to try to shortsale or foreclose on the home. Two years ago ( XX/XX/XXXX ) we began the short sale process with Bank of America, the holder of the mortgage. Within the first 6 months we had between XXXX-XXXX offers valid, several were at or above the value of the home and XXXX of them were cash offers. None of the offers were accepted and for the next almost 18 month time period we have wrestled with their ridiculous system. We have filed the same paperwork over 5 times. We were even so frustrated that we have offered to file for a Deed in Lieu of foreclosure or even a straight out foreclosure and we were told that they would n't accept it. 

After doing some research we believe that Bank of America is "" Dual Tracking '' our property, which is working on a foreclosure while also working on loan modification. This is not legal and they have lost class action suits for this very action. We have now begun to receive notification of Foreclosure process even though we are still semi-weekly filling out and faxing paperwork for the loan modification process so we can short sale. 

At this time we have once again XXXX-XXXX valid offers for short sale on the property. They have been adding bogus fees to our monthly statements including fees for yard work, lock change, cleaning, maintenance, mail fees, etc. some of which we believe they have made up because we have received no documentation. We paid for the proposed yard work and maintenance performed on the property out of our own pockets.. We also just received a statement with an Attorney/Trustee fee which leads us to believe they have already begun the foreclosure proceeding. At this point we just want to be done. We 'd love to have the home sold but we really do n't think they are ever going to process or accept an offer. We 've been doing this since XX/XX/XXXX and it 's exhausting. BoA is clearly working against itself. While they tell us during regular phone calls that the loan modification / short sale process is moving forward, we receive letters indicating they are foreclosing. 

I spoke to BoA on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( MT ) XXXX XXXX ( our Account Manager ) informed me at that time that the property did NOT have a foreclosure date set and that we were now being moved into either a Short Sale or Deed in Lieu of foreclosure. I opted for Deed in Lieu, citing BoA 's history of unwillingness to allow a sale to go through. I also told her that we had offers on the table. 

She informed me that we would follow up on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In the meantime, we received notice that they house had been rekeyed and it was moving into foreclosure."
Mortgage,"After many attempts to have my home modified and treated fairly, it is my conclusion that based on facts such as my race, gender, age and XXXX Bank of America has denied me any and all assistant to maintain my home. I have provided all documents since this process started and all BANK OF AMERICA has provided to me been stressed, harassment and unfair practices dealing with mortgage assistant. 

I would like to file a discrimination charge against BANK OF AMERICA."
Mortgage,"This is with respect to my experience with Bank of America, XXXX, NJ Branch. I contacted them for a pre qualification of a mortgage loan before I can put an offer on a house I was interested in buying. I made it very clear to them that this is just pre-qualification and asked them if doing it will have any impact on my credit report, and if it did then I do n't want to proceed with them. They made it very clear that this will only be a soft check and it will in no way affect my credit history/report. I went ahead with the pre-qualification with them based on this assurance. However to my surprise my credit history was affected as they run a hard check on my SSN. When I contacted them asking for explanation, the person said she was not aware of it and said she was sorry, but said there was no way to fix it. This happened on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I even complained to the BOA redressal cell, but never got a response back from them."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, 2015Letters of Harassments. Beginning to receive letters from Bank of America, addressed from XXXX, Tx XXXX. Cover page states "" Time Sensitive ''.

I fell behind on my mortgage and had started to catch up my payments. In XX/XX/2018 I sent in two payments which got me closer to being caught up. However the payment I sent to Bank of America on XX/XX/2018 was sent back with a letter stating they were returning the funds for the following reasons : the funds were not sent via Certified Funds, funds are less than total amount due, and there is no active repayment plan or loan assistance option in place. All reinstatements must be received in the form of certified funds. This wasn't the first time the denied payment. It also happened in XX/XX/2014. Both times they claimed they sent me a letter with an amount to reinstate my loan. I never received anything from them prior to this stating my loan needed to be reinstated. I called as soon as I received the letter. I was told I needed to go online and download loan modification papers because they don't mail them out anymore. I told them I was unable to print them from my phone. They told me they would mail the papers and that I should receive them within 5 to 7 business days. I didn't receive them so I called again and was told they would be mailed. I still didn't receive them so I called a 3rd time. This time they transferred me to tech support and I was walked thru the steps of printing the application from my phone. By this time it is XX/XX/XXXX. I got the application filled out but I was missing one paper that had to be mailed by Bank of America. I called again. I was told it would be mailed via XXXX   and that I should receive it in 3 business days. In the meantime I get a letter stating my loan had been sold to XXXX XXXX but Bank of America was still servicing the loan. I never received the paper I needed to complete the application. I did receive a phone call from Bank of America. The woman asked for me and then said Oh never mind, we aren't servicing your loan anymore and hung up. I had no contact information for XXXX XXXX. All I wanted to do was pay my mortgage. While I was going thru this with Bank of America I was falling even further behind. I later found out my mortgage was sold on XX/XX/2018 and XXXX XXXX took over on XX/XX/2018.

In XX/XX/2018 I received a call from XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX. I explained to him what had happened with Bank of America and that was the reason is was so far behind. He said he would mail me a Loss Mitigation Application. He told me that I would receive statements but not to make any payments while they were reviewing my application. He explained the purpose of the application was to figure out which program I would qualify for. He told me they had several such as deferment, loan modification and refinance as well as many others. I filled it out and mailed it back. The application was denied because it just had my income. When I called in XXXX told me I should just move out so I could have a little change in my pocket. I was very upset by this comment. I filled out another application with my income as well as my husband 's. They sent an assessor to my house to take photos of my house to determine its value. I received a copy and it had wrong information and an inflated assessment. I was denied again and was only considered for repayment. There were other programs listed that I wasn't considered for because either the owner of my loan didn't participate or there wasn't enough equity in my home. I feel the only reason they want to make us homeless is because they think they can sell the house for more than what I owe. They sent me a letter with the amount for reinstatement which I don't have the full amount right now and they won't take even a partial payment.

I have fallen so far behind because of the run around I got with Bank of America. I know I would've been completely caught up by now if it hadn't been for Bank of America XXXX me around while they were completing the sale of my mortgage. Now I'm dealing with the bullies at XXXX XXXX.

I just want to stay in my home and make my payments."
Mortgage,"Over the 10 years I have had my Bank of America mortgage loan, they have put me through XXXX and back. I have to call 3 times to get 3 different reps to get answers, which results in different answers. Bank of America pushed HOME MODIFICATION process on me since I was having issues with my mortgage due to unforseen medical and being the sole source of income. As I found online for so many other mortgage holders with BOA, BOA told me the paperwork I filled out was either misplaced or not filled out properly. They have been sued over this quite a bit by others. Thousands of homeowners fall prey to this. 

I was told in order to proceed I would need to skip 2 months of mortgage payments, to show I was on hard times. That really scared me. I did miss the 2 months and was told they would be put at the end of my 30 year loan. During the recent incident someone else told me the bank never puts missed payments on the end of any loan! 

I was falling on hard times and reached a point it was hard to afford my mortgage. I was told to skip 2 months payments and that they would be put at the end of my loan. That was about 2 years ago. I have been behind by 2 months only and not late and have made every payment on time for 10 years. 

I received a letter in XX/XX/2019 saying my mortgage was going {$80.00} lower due to PMI finally falling off the account. I have been fighting the PMI issue for at least 3 years. The letter stated it would start XX/XX/2019. I called and a rep verified it would start XX/XX/2019, although the letter stated XX/XX/XXXX. I sent my mortgage payment for {$80.00} lower for my XX/XX/XXXX payment per the rep I spoke to. 

I called to make a payment for the {$80.00} difference 2 days later when I found out ( my  account was negative by {$6000.00}! ) BOA didn't charge me for {$80.00}, they charged me {$5600.00}! I never authorized this and the rep never mentioned it! This is illegal activity. My bank stopped payment and now it's past the grace period so I was late. I am now late with XX/XX/XXXX payment due to this fiasco from BOA. My bank stopped payment and reversed the problem BOA caused. The {$80.00} was not charged so I had to call BOA again, talk to a couple reps, and FINALLY they said it was charged, which took another couple of business days. 

Because I'm late, due to their clerical error, they said there is a letter generated with intent to foreclose that is being sent out. I need to come up with 2 months mortgage to bring it current by XX/XX/2019! I am given one month to come up with {$5000.00} plus fees plus taxes, which makes no sense since I have escrow through them. By law they can't generate a letter until 4 months missed payments occur. I also get more than a month to get the funds. I don't have the funds. I am looking into suing BOA. This is ridiculous and not my fault! 
thanks!"

Mortgage,"I have been dealing with Bank of America for almost 3 years on trying to process a loan modification for my mortgage. Over the past year, I have been dealing with a "" personal account representative '' in trying to get my mortgage caught up. I made payment arrangement and made XXXX of the XXXX payments that I had arranged to pay. Throughout all of the processes, I was in constant communication with my personal account rep, and was again ( for the XXXX or XXXX time ) requesting documentation for the loan modification process. I had set up bi-weekly phone calls to speak with my account rep and would speak with the rep when they called. The last XXXX times I spoke with the account rep, it was a different person that I had normally talked to. I asked why I was n't able to speak with my usual account rep, and the reply was "" they are busy, or your case was reassigned. '' Each of the last XXXX calls I said I had yet to receive the loan modification paperwork and was told it was being sent out. I still have not received it. I made a payment in XXXX, which was accepted, and finally was able to send the full amount due to bring my mortgage completely current, which was mailed on XXXX XXXX. I called on XXXX XXXX to find out if my payment was received and was told that my payment was returned because my mortgage was in foreclosure and in order for them to be able to accept any payments from me, it needed to be "" reinstated '' and I would need to pay the reinstatement fees along with any past due balance. I was told I was sent a letter stating that all future payments needed to be certified check or money order. I asked them when my mortgage went into forclosure and was told it entered pre-foreclosure on XXXX XXXX, and foreclosure on XXXX XXXX. The only letters I have received from Bank of America are from XXXX stating they stopped my modification application process because they never received my documents ( which they never sent to me, I never received them ), a notice dated XXXX XXXX saying they received my payment of XXXX which they applied, but said that since it was for more ( I paid the full payment amount, plus late fees as agreed to with my account rep ) so they had unapplied fund of XX.XX to an "" unapplied funds balance of my loan ''. I received my normal monthly statement for XXXX, I received an Escrow Account Review on XXXX/XXXX/15 telling me my escrow account was adjusted and that my new payment amount beginning in XXXX would be less. I received my normal monthly statement for XXXX ( statement date XXXX XXXX ) which reflected the payment I made per the arrangement with my account rep. I received a notice on XXXX XXXX, advising that HUD cancelled my mortgage insurance premiums because the principle balance reached 78 % or lower of the initial sales prices or appraised value. 
On XXXX XXXX I received a letter which was in response to a requested payoff figures, which I NEVER did or asked for. Also on XXXX XXXX I received a letter saying, "" its not too late to avoid forclosure '' Call us immediately ( which I received on XXXX XXXX ), which is after I spoke with XXXX different representatives who told me they received my check on XXXX XXXX. And finally, a letter dated XXXX XXXX ( also not received until XXXX XXXX ), ( funny, the same day they received my payment to bring my account current ) was a payoff statement saying my loan was in foreclosure. Both the XXXX XXXX letters and the XXXX XXXX letter were received on XXXX XXXX. 
After speaking to the XXXX representatives on Friday XXXX XXXX, and was told my payment to bring my mortgage current was being returned and that they would NOT accept any payments from me until I paid the reinstatement fees. And this is all while I WAS talking to them in trying to get my mortgage to a current status. They say they are trying to help, but not the person who needs the help."
Mortgage,"I own a two family home. I applied for a loan modification back in XXXX of XXXX. Prior to that date we had fell behind in paying the mortgage back in XX/XX/XXXX. My brother who is the co borrower on the loan fell behind due to getting laid off from work due to COVID and my second job was also cut off until further notice. XX/XX/XXXX, my brother then filed a quit deed and that left me alone to pay my mortgage. My tenant loss her job XX/XX/XXXX due to COVID and then moved out. I have been in communication with Bank of America since XX/XX/XXXX until now XX/XX/XXXX. It's been 8 months of a prolonged loss mitigation review process. They have asked me for endless repeated documents and also explanation of expenses. I have been nothing but compliant with all of the documents that was asked for. I call and check in every week with something new being asked of me to send proof of every time. Just when I thought they had everything, the underwriter asked for tax transcripts and proof of water bill back in XX/XX/XXXX which I provided in XXXX  XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter that they did not receive documentation of income or proof of occupancy and they closed my case. That was a conflicting letter because every document they asked for I sent it in a timely fashion and spoke to a loan representative every week. It's a dead end calling because someone different answers every time and has to review the file all over again with no answers. I don't know if because I am XXXX american that they won't help me and is basically giving me the run around. They would keep telling me they are noting the account and messaging the under writer and call back in a few days and when I call back dead end no answers. Today XX/XX/XXXX was the last straw for me when they told me that my file was closed on XX/XX/XXXX and I would have to reapply. This is not my fault I want help more than anything and I have been sending my information faithfully upon asked and checking in every week. They don't call me to ask me for information needed. Whenever I call that's when I know information is needed. This is unacceptable and unprofessional there are programs to help people and they won't help me. This is not the first time I have reached out to them regarding my mortgage and they keep denying me. I have XXXX  children I need my home. I have an income all I need is mortgage relief and lower monthly payments. Its very stressful trying your best to save your home and then to find out for all these months was a dead end. Its not right XXXX  I am XXXX, XXXX  XXXX  confused and I don't know where to get help."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX of 2022, I applied for a Home Equity Line of Credit with Bank of America. 

The process was a display of sheer incompetence on behalf of Bank of America. Specifically, asking for the same documents multiple times, not communicating status, not returning calls when I wanted specific information, assigned loan officer didn't return calls, customer service reps providing conflicting information when I called multiple times. 

After several weeks of this, I lost total trust in Bank of America and asked them to withdraw my loan. To add insult to injury, after my cancellation request, they added themselves as a lienholder on my home insurance without my permission."
Mortgage,"I'm a XXXX. customer of Bank of America and have a Preferred Customer classification with BofA. On XXXX XXXX I started the loan process to obtain a loan for {$89000.00} to purchase a second home. I had already deposited {$22000.00} with my escrow company to purchase a second home. On XX/XX/XXXX BofA provided a loan estimate. I worked with their local credit solution advisor ( XXXX XXXX ). After several discussions with the bank, they told me the home I wanted to buy was too close to my existing residence. It would have to be an "" investment property '' requiring the 20 % down payment with the escrow company. BofA quoted me estimated closing costs of {$6800.00}. After several more document requests and few answers why they considered my loan an investment property they up the closing costs to {$10000.00} for {$89000.00} XXXX. loan. My complaint is Bank of America 's online process provided little guidance on why they need so much documents, many they already have. And little explanation why they changed their original estimate and up the costs. They also quoted me and obtain an appraisal fee of {$950.00}, other lenders were charging {$650.00}. My BofA credit advisor told me they charge more because they require faster service from their appraisal partners. I paid my appraisal fee on XX/XX/22. I'm still waiting for the appraisal report ( XX/XX/22 ). And due the delay, by BofA, the seller has to pay an added "" padding '' fee to escrow company and a delay in closing of the loan. BofA is unprofessional in providing information on specific loan questions, I requested and explaining added charges. I am XXXX and wonder if BofA is discrimating against me or they system is flaud and their staff is not properly trained.

Do to this negligence not only have they stolen my identity, my social, they have committed fraud, they have sent to my credit report that i am deceased. I cant apply for my dream home, apply for a car loan or anything for that matter since I look like the XXXX committing fraud over their "" XXXX '' game as Countrywide called it to get a mortgage out for their numbers.

Mortgage,"The terms of my mortgage refinance loan at closing were not the locked in rates of my application or what I was promised. I became aware of the changes when I reviewed my closing documents, there was no explanation prior to the date of signing."
Mortgage,"I complained on XXXX of XXXX, 2015 regarding my mortgage with Bank of America. After the initial complain they have forwarded me to another department. The new representative seems like work for another company that is hired by Bank Of America. They have requested me the change in circumstances paperwork that I have submitted within a day or two. I have also provided all the supporting income documents for example, bank statements, and profit and loss statements. In addition I have also provided the pay stub for my wife and bank statements of my daughter because according to the website I can add household income too, even if they are not on loan. It seems that foreclosure date is coming and they are trying to gain more time. According to the law, once they receive change in modification documents complete package. They should stop the foreclosure but again Bank of America is trying to play the same witty gimmicks, that they have played with XXXX of Americans for throwing out people out of their houses. Again the person I am working with left me a phone message and after that I tried calling him XXXX times but he was not available. I got a hold of their another manager who started another paper trail which I have provided within hours and it seems like she stopped picking up her phone too. Once they realized that they might can not ask for any possible papers in the world, they stop picking up the phones. Even I had to tell the, m that a person in household can contribute in the qualification process because my initial representative XXXX XXXX have absolutely fooled us for all this time telling that we can not use any other income if its not in the mortgage. Any way I am attaching all the documents provided to bank of America for change in circumstances and hope that someone would take a look at it and ask them for answers. Since they play with peoples emotions by asking some kind of paperwork and after you provide them they tell you that no we cant use this because of some reason and then you provide them more and so on. Please stop this mega monster company from playing with peoples emotion because if they cant do it tell us in first place why play these games with the innocent customers."

That time one benefit was no appraisal required by BofA. I asked BofA remove my PMI monthly payments, but they rejected my request. I paid PMI sinceXX/XX/XXXX {$98.00} x 12 month x 11 years = {$13000.00}!!! just PMI!!! beside interest ( 4-6 ) % on top of this.XX/XX/XXXX, last year, I asked BofA calculate for me how much I have to pay down to avoid PMI, that really unfair charges that sound like penalty to the first time home buyer!!! instead of benefits I got penalty!! Well since that BofA replied my with the general letter. I went twice in local branch : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXKS XXXX, tel XXXX. XXXX XXXX /NMLS ID XXXX/ and he was not able to tell me exact amount of pay to avoid PMI. I decided make own calculation. I borrowed $ XXXX from BofA, my resent balance $ XXXX, then ratio is 82 % ( XXXX:XXXX ) O.K. the general letters said my ratio need to be at least 80 %. Well, I paid down other $ 20K.

But BofA refused to accept XXXX COUNTY APPRAISER and force me to do an appraisal from they list that cost me $ 500- {$600.00}!! why do I need trough my money UNNECESSARY to somebody instead of to make payments against my principal? Why BofA was able refinance me in the first place without appraisal, and refused now?? I see only one answer : GREED!! the vain hope of finding work."
Mortgage,"- Started refinancing my existing mortgage on XX/XX/2021 - Received a closing estimate and a notice to close on XX/XX/2021 - Lender is Bank of America - Actual closing happened on XX/XX/2021, without any explanation and with a dishonest and disrespectful behavior of loan agents and his supervisor throughout the process - Called the Bank of America to file a complaint several time and sent various emails regarding the extreme delay in the refinance application process by the Bank of America which caused me several financial losses ( including time opportunity cost and losing other options with low rate mortgage payment opportunities over the past 7 months - my estimate is at least {$20.00} ) and all these caused other challenges in our family and life planning throughout this year. A summary of what i kept mentioning to the Bank is as follows : 1. Time opportunity cost for 7 months as of XX/XX/2021. I had to continue paying my current mortgage at the rate of 3.5 % which I could save if there was not such a long delay in my refinance process with BoA 2. I have received several offers for a refinance payment rate as low as 2.0 % 3. I have received several emails, letters and calls from other lenders ( including XXXX XXXX, my current lender ) with guaranteed closing dates, lower closing fees, which I had to turn down because of my ongoing application with BoA. 

4. BoA has performed a hard check on my credit twice which has caused damage to my credit score thereby charging higher rates. This is true if I now want to go with other lenders as well. They are going to charge me higher rates. The need for the second round of the credit check was because of the extreme delay on the BoA side. 

5. BoA is going to charge me with another {$920.00} fee for the title as an additional cost which is not my responsibility at all and hasn't been discussed in the offer letter and throughout the process. 

Last but not least, the Bank never respond to my complaint with a prompt reply. And I have observed dishonesty throughout the process. 

I am writing this on XX/XX/2021 and the disbursement date is on XX/XX/2021. But I haven't heard back from them. 

After so many follow ups the loan officer sent me a complaint case number, XXXX, which is the number they use to track my complaint. I have tried to call BoA 's customer service and other numbers to track the complaint and find out about the status. But all I heard was that they can not place such a tracking number and no success at all."

Mortgage,"This is the issue in which I am requesting a relief letter from Bank Of America. 

For consideration : BOA mortgage acct # XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a voluntary petition under Chapter XXXX of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court. On XX/XX/XXXX, it was discharged. The debt was not reaffirmed. ( I attached a copy of the Bankruptcy doc and Letter of confirmation from BOA ) 2. A Deed In Lieu of Foreclosure was completed on the same property on XX/XX/XXXX. ( I have attached a copy of the Deed In Lieu doc ).

Note : I should not have been advised to enter into a second hardship situation on the same property that had previously been discharged in Bankruptcy.i A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a deed instrument in which a mortgagors ( i.e. the borrower ) conveys all interest in a real property to the mortgagee ( i.e. the lender ) to satisfy a loan that is in default and avoid foreclosure proceedings. Further, the deed in lieu of foreclosure offers several advantages to both the borrower and the lender. The principal advantage to the borrower is that it immediately releases him/her from most or all of the personal indebtedness associated with the defaulted loan. 

My question/issue : I contacted Bank Of America in XXXX XXXX for advice on how best to vacate the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Al XXXX that had been previously discharged in Bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised to initiate a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure. 

According to the description or definition of a Deed In Lieu stated above the Deed In Lieu process should not have been required because I was no longer responsible for the debt after the bankruptcy discharge on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX see attachments ) The guidance I received from BOA has caused a great deal of confusion thereby increasing the waiting time for me to become eligible for a new mortgage. My waiting time should be four years from the date of the Bankruptcy that occurred in XXXX XXXX which would have made me eligible as early XXXX ; however, having been advised to enter into the Deed In Lieu, the waiting period started with the transfer of title in XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore I will not be eligible until XX/XX/XXXX. 

Why did BOA allow this action to take place?"
Mortgage,"I have been a homeowner in my current home for approximately 10 years. Every year I have always paid my property taxes.

When I went to pay my taxes on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I discovered that the taxes had been paid and I did not know how or why. A week later I received a letter from Bank of America stating that starting XXXX XXXX, 2016, I would have to pay over {$2400.00} a month because they had paid my taxes on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and open me up an escrow account which I never had and did not want. I called them and advised them that I had the money to pay my taxes and I did not want Bank of America to pay my taxes. I paid them the amount they had paid for the taxes but the refused to put my payment back to the original amount of {$1600.00}. They said I would have the pay the {$2400.00} for a year and then they would review my account at the end of the year. I advised them that I could not make these increase payments because I am on a fixed income and my taxes had been paid which was only {$3800.00}. I advised them that all taxes they had paid was paid by me and now the escrow account that they had open was at a {$0.00} balance. They still refused to put my payment back to the original amount, even after talking to several of their employees who stated if the escrow amount was at {$0.00} my payments would return to the original amount."

Mortgage,"Bank of America Home Loan became owner of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loan when XXXX XXXXXXXX was in trouble. Loan type : 30 year Conv Adj Rate, 27 years 5 months/Interest rate 6.125 % ; first time home buyer XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I was able to refinance at a 24 year and 11 month adjustable, interest rate 3.375 %. 
In XXXX I applied with B of A Home Loans endlessly for both a mortgage reduction, when refused I tried refinancing my existing loan to a fix rate interest. Spent hours submitting documents ( which were lost more than once ) speaking with representatives, email, standard mail, B of A Home Loan Portal correspondence. After months I finally gave up trying. 
My current adjustable interest increased in XXXX and XXXX. 
My payments have increased from $ XXXX in XXXX, to $ XXXX in XXXX, to my current payment of $ XXXX. 
Clearly an adjustable interest means my payments have increased and will continue to do so. 
Had B of A Home Loan wanted to help me when I first approached them, I wouldn't be in this situation. 
My honest feeling is that B of A wants me to foreclose on my property to reap the financial benefits. Their representation has been less than stellar. XXXX XXXX is the last representative I tried to work with."
Mortgage,"My mortgage account is in forbearance under the CARES Act effective XX/XX/2020 to XX/XX/2020 or for three ( 3 ) months. Hence, I did send a payment on XX/XX/2020. 

However, about the middle of XXXX I requested for a pay-off quote which I received, in writing, on XX/XX/XXXX with a good through date of XX/XX/2020. 

On XX/XX/2020, at a banking institution ( branch ) in XXXX, IL, with the assistance of a teller and their manager, the amount of {$140000.00} was transferred.moved from my personal checking account ending in XXXX to my mortgage account ending in XXXX. 

The amount transferred was the exact same amount as the one in the pay-off quote. 

Monday to Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I kept calling BofA customer Service. I was transferred multiple times from Customer Service to Mortgage to Collections and back. And the wait times were horrible to the point that it would sometimes reach an hour. For a conglomerate such a BofA I find this as unacceptable. You do not value your customers ' time. Furthermore, whenever I do talk to a live person nobody could assist me as to what is going on. 

My mortgage accounts is till showing a balance and everything is on hold. Release of lien,  forwarding to the recorder 's office, title, etc. It is as if the whole process stopped and nobody in BofA could or would resolve the situation. 

My contact phone # is XXXX."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has caused to be recorded with the XXXX XXXX County Recorders Office a defective Notice of Default with form entitled California Declaration in violation of California Civil Code of Procedure Statute 2015.5 and California Civil Code Section 2923 - 2944.10. Bank of America knows or should know the laws of the state of California where they do business. I believe this is an intentional act meant to coerce, harass and cause me extreme disstress in on-going attempts by Bank of America to separate me from my home. 
The form is the fourth page of the recorded Notice of Default ( NOD ) and Election to Sell. Because of the form 's defect, the whole NOD is void and voidable."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is been trying to wrongful foreclose on my home. Bank of America stopped me since XXXX from making my mortgage payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, a fire happened in my home, my tenants and myself was put out of the house by the fire department because there 's was no water or power. My garage and part of my downstairs were totally lost to the fire, and I lost all my incomes, all my rental incomes and my job working for my own elderly tenant as a XXXX XXXX. Bank of America immediately and continue offered me modifications as I asked them for a HARP Program Refinance while I was waiting for the rebuilding of my home. When bank of America put me with the modifications their representatives that handled those modifications made it sounded like I will be approved and promised me that not to worry they are there to help me and I will get help. I continued asked them for a HARP Refinance Program, because I have over {$240000.00}. in my home equity and it makes sense for them to use some of my equity to pay any behind payments in the future while I was looking for another job and while I was waiting for the rebuilding of my home after the fire. Bank of America told me on the phone in XX/XX/XXXX every time I asked for refinance under HARP Program that the HARP Program is over and it 's no longer there. That was not true, that program is still here and not over till XX/XX/XXXX of this year XX/XX/XXXX. All bank of America offers me all the time and every year are modifications. The modifications they offered me in XXXX and XXXX were all frauds. How can I be approved on those two years that they already knew I lost all my incomes to  the fire and they knew already homeowners income is one of the thing and the main thing that their bank approves homeowners for modification, but this is the way and this is how bank of America steal people 's home. The insurance that bank of America picked for my home when I bought it in XXXX also took almost a year to rebuilt my home. My home is been rebuilt since XXXX and I have a lot more rental incomes now, and my own monthly check. I 'm not having financial difficulty anymore like the time of the fire, but bank of America is still stopping me for making my mortgage payments. What is behind on my loan is bank of America 's fault for stopping me for making my payments, telling me that I ca n't make mortgage payments because I was and I am under their fake, illegal, fraud modifications. Here are the illegal frauds and violation bank of America is being doing to my loan from XX/XX/XXXX when I bought my home, fake forge documents paper works, changing of my locked interest rate from 4.25 % to 4.50 % without letting me know, over stated appraisal value of my property, refusing of documents when I ask for, lost of documents for modifications and have me resubmit over and over again, their underwriter violation, violation of UCC9 law, promised me on XX/XX/XXXX of this year XX/XX/XXXX that they reviewed my loan and found a lot of mistakes on their part and said no more foreclosure threating from them but they are here to help me, so they sent me to discharge my bankruptcy XXXX case with my bankruptcy lawyer so they can start helping me, after dismissing my case, they offered me another modification in XX/XX/XXXX of this year XX/XX/XXXX which they fraud me up again, while I am on this time modification after dismissing my case like bank of America told me to go do, they are still saying my loan is in the process of foreclosure, but no sale date. I only discharged my case because of bank of America 's promise no more foreclosure on my loan, and they will help me at this time, apparently not, is all lies this is not right, The other thing Bank of America has on my loan contract documents is XXXX-ROBOT signing I 'm asking your office please do something real quick to help me before this fraud bank take my home, I do n't understand all this frauds and violations all I wanted was to buy a home and make my payments, but I thank XXXX for your help for the homeowners like me that are living with fears and stress of losing home because I do n't understand all these illegal fraud bank. Please contact me if there 's any question my phone is XXXX"
Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX I applied to Bank of America for refinancing of home due to scamming by current mortgage holder.  XX/XX/XXXX house was appraised; appraised value approximately $40,000 less than comparables.  Made written complaint to BOA and multiple phone 
calls.  Only responses came from local mortgage loan officer who had to get update from someone else.  XXXX day he was not there and was told previous Thursday was his last day on job.  Since, received XXXX return phone calls but no others although I tried to get updates.  I was told to NOT pay previous mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. but in XX/XX/XXXX. paid because I was three months overdue.  Still no response from BOA as to current status of initial application.  In XX/XX/XXXX. was finally told application was cancelled because of concern over appraisal.  Offered to reapply which I accepted.  Finally closed in mid-XX/XX/XXXX.  Before re-fi- application had HELOC which was rolled into re-fi amount.  After closing in XX/XX/XXXX. I received appraisal ""drive-by"" update upholding original appraisal but limited MLS inquiry to houses sold to max of $100.000 since date of original appraisal.  Three weeks after original appraisal, house XXXX with initial identical floor sold for $40,000 more than the appraisal of my house.  As after initial appraisal I made complaint to XXXX which denied any action.  Soon after closing on re-fi
 BOA re-applied for HELOC and was denied for # of delinquent accounts, proportion of balance to limit on revolving accts, too many inquiries in last 12 months, and insufficient length of revolving credit history.  Report dated XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX credit agencies shows
XXXX, XXXX, XXXX but another document shows XXXX for credit score.  Current report shows XXXX acct--XXXX of which have current activity.  Others have been paid off.  No. of  inquiries were elevated due primarily to activity related to re-fi and HELOC activity and  
one emergency home repair.  History reported goes back as far as XX/XX/XXXX.  I don't know where they came up with their conclusions.  I am satisfied with the ultimate re-financing but not with the hassles I had to go through to get to that point which had a deleterious effect on my health during this time.  I had to talk to too many different people to find out what was going on only to get no response.  Then to get this fabricated denial of my HELOC application was a ""low blow.""  I think it all revolves around the falsified appraisal."
Mortgage,This is my second request for help. My mortgage payments were not posted on the correct day. I never spoke to anyone at Bank of America about my problem. I received in the mail a letter about the processing time for night drop that I was not satisfied with.
Mortgage,"This complaint is a follow up on my complaint submitted XX/XX/XXXX due to lack of communication from Bank of America. I received a voicemail from a lady from phone number XXXX EXT XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, who has still not returned my phone call after several attempts and multiple voicemails I've left her. This matter is urgent and is preventing the sell of my home. 

To whom it may concern : I bought my home on XX/XX/XXXX. The seller had a payoff with First Franklin Financial Corp which was collected on the XXXX at the closing. Fast forward to today. I am now selling my home and it is under contract and our closing date was XX/XX/XXXX, however has been prevented due to this issue. The current title company has been trying to get a lien release from the previous mortgage company and or a cancelled check from the previous closing title company XXXX XXXX XXXX law firm ( XXXX XXXX ) in XXXX Ky. The law firm refuses to give the cancelled check that is proof the loan was paid off and the mortgage company refuses to send a lien release.

Mortgage,"I want to file a complaint to Bank of America, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. My loan with Bank of America was originated in XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was for me and my wife XXXX XXXX name ( see attached documents ). I went through several loan modifications applications and finally I had everything completed all paper works as they asked done by XX/XX/XXXX. I called to check the status of the paperwork at the beginning of XXXX and they said they turned my mortgage over to another company, "" XXXX XXXX ''. When I spoke to XXXX XXXX  they said that my forms will transfer over and they said I didn't need to complete a loan modification because I already had one in due process. I ask them to provide me with what I need to do to get help to cure my debt they then said in XXXX it is too late because it's inside the dates for the foreclosure so it's too late. They made a sale date foreclosure for XX/XX/XXXX. I was able to file bankruptcy to try and figure things out so we can reapply for the modification. They allowed me to complete another modification as they requested. XXXX XXXX XXXX decided to send another foreclosure date on XX/XX/XXXX on behalf of XXXX XXXX. I then asked the law group to stop the foreclosure proceeding as I would get the finance, I disputed the balance owed. After a full research in the courthouse, I started questioning the legitimacy of the company foreclosing. I have proof in the records showing that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not hold the note at the time they were filing the foreclosure proceedings, the note was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( See documents ). I tried to file a motion to stop the proceeding on XX/XX/XXXX and I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and ask them to explain why are they collecting on a debt that they do not own the rights to. The court magistrate said my paperwork has to be filed by a lawyer after I told her that I couldn't afford one and I was acting as Prose. I was then denied my right to pay and file my case through a court proceeding ( another issue ). My property was supposedly foreclosed on XX/XX/XXXX. At the foreclosure no one bought the property it went back to the bank the guy uttered. I had a roommate who was told to leave. I made phone calls to XXXX XXXX and they were saying that the investor is going to call me and no one ever called me to discuss me leaving as they realize that we knew that they were not the note holder, I ask them to show me proof that they own the note and I will cooperate and take legal actions as necessary. No one called or contact me until XX/XX/XXXX I found a note from another company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX telling me that I have to leave and they summons me for an eviction on XXXX in XXXX XXXXXXXX VA . This company claims that they were the one who bought the property when clearly I was there and no one bought it. In addition to my complaint, the bank never sent me a notification that they were changing my lender. XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I plan to submit all of my evidence in hope for a reversal on my so-called foreclosure. I am going to ask the court to allow us to cure the debt as offered by law. I want to file these complaints to assist with my filing, in addition, I would like the public to be educated on loan predators who act like they are the owner and they say they want to help you but they are just buying time to sell your debt for a profit. I am in the process of volunteering to help people in this situation, I would be glad to join your team in any capacity if needed. I am thankful for your help. My phone number is XXXX.

XXXX, Nc XXXX THIS IS A COMPLAINT FOR RETURN OF SURPLUS FORECLOSURE FUNDS. 

After taking over our home loan ( Loan # XXXX ) from Countrywide, Bank of America, despite our many communications that : 1. We have a loan modification application pending with Countrywide 2. And that we are dealing with extensive XXXX XXXX XXXX in the house, went ahead and foreclosed on the house and sold it to XXXX. ( see attached foreclosure document ) For years we wondered why BofA ignored the hold on the loan as we were working out a loan modification with Countrywide. We learned recently that the house sold for more than the loan amount - substantially more. 

Bank of America however made sure to use up all the excess amount above the loan balance by tacking on misleading, inaccurate and bogus interests and fees so that there will be no surplus foreclosure funds ( that normally would be returned to the homeowner. ) This complaint is for Bank of America to return to us the excess or surplus foreclosure funds that they illegally appropriated for themselves and "" stole '' from us.

Mortgage,My husband got hurt in XX/XX/XXXX we were unable to make payments due to not receiving workers comp in a timely matter. I kept in touch with bank of america home loans the entire time from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX when they wanted a reinstatement amount to reinstate the loan..which was close to {$15000.00}. and we have made payments on time since XXXX XXXX.. XX/XX/XXXX got a notice that our mortgage would be serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they told me that my loan was still with Bank of America Home Loans.. I called Bank of America Home loans and they ask me three different times did I file bankruptcy I said no.. All of mortgage information was wiped off my XXXX XXXX  XXXX account online.. I did file a complaint with XXXX XXXX XXXX of what I found and they haven't answered back. Our mortgage has been reporting to credit bureaus that our loan closed XX/XX/XXXX and showing a XXXX balance and it shows they had not reported for years on our mortgage and its showing under negative information on our credit reports .. I am sending the credit reports showing it says Bank of america closed ... I filed a complaint with XXXX and told me they would look into it and get back with us.. After filing complaint I got a postcard from BOA Home loans for us to retrieve a message through a message system. the message was we are sorry we forgot to inform you that your loan closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Well the problem is we only modified our loan once. and that was XXXX XXXX..Consumers are only allowed to modifiy their loans once in length of the loan ... but this message and along our credit reports show our loan closed XX/XX/XXXX and have been showing negative since that date with no reporting of us making payments since XX/XX/XXXX on time ... their was no modification done because there had already done a modification ... WE BELIEVE BOA AMERICA HOME LOANS WROTE OFF THE REMAINING INTEREST AT TAX TIME BECAUSE WE WERE UNABLE TO MAKE OUR PAYMENTS FROM XX/XX/XXXX TO XX/XX/XXXX WHEN THEY TOOK A LARGE AMOUNT TO REINSTATE OUR LOAN CLOSE TO {$15000.00} AND WE HAVE BEEN MAKING PAYMENTS ON TIME EVER SINCE.

THEY ARE STILL COLLECTING FROM US BUT SHOW A CLOSED ACCOUNT WITH A XXXX BALANCE. i FEEL LIKE WE ARE BEING SCAMMED THEY WROTE US OFF AS A BAD DEBT OR THEY COLLECT FROM PMI OR SOMETHING..THEY SENT THE POSTCARD TELLING US THEY FORGOT TO TELL US..

SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH THIS I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE COVERING UP AND STILL COLLECTING MONEY FROM US..HELP FEDERAL TRAD COMMISSION GAVE ME YOUR WEB ADDRESS AND ASK US TO FILE COMPLAINT WITH YOUR COMPANY ...
Mortgage,"Bank of America has demonstrated an on-going level of incompetence, callous disregard for the wellbeing of its customer and negligence in their responsibility to adequately guide a client through a loan process. Because of their unprofessional behavior we have suffered extraordinary emotional hardship and they have inflicted a financial burden on us not initially intended when we applied for the loan. 

One of many issues is as follows. After going through an extraordinarily difficult mortgage finalization process I wrote to the president of Bank of America. Within a very short time I received calls from a corporate representative in XXXX, another representative in XXXX and a regional District Sales Manager. 

My issue, at this point, is the way they have opted to getting around paying what they said they would pay me. In response to my complaint they agreed to cover the cost of the house appraisal and to honor their "" guaranteed close '' agreement. In a discussion with the District Sales Manager he stated that a reimbursement of travel costs due to their inadequate notification that our initial close date could not be met. We discussed the rates to be utilized to arrive at a figure and he said that actual receipts would not be needed. He asked if this approach would be acceptable. I told him to email all that we have talked about and I will review it with my wife. Here is what the representative from the corporate office wrote me soon after : "" XXXX XXXX, I spoke with XXXX and he asked me to pass along this information to you regarding your request for reimbursement. If you have any questions or need anything additional, please feel free to reach out to XXXX at XXXX. I have cc 'd him on this email as well. 
Regarding Reimbursement : There were XXXX trips back and forth between XXXX and XXXX. The trip is approximately XXXX miles. This brings the total mileage to XXXX miles. At $ XXXX/mile that would bring the total mileage reimbursement to {$620.00}. 
The hotel room was {$87.00} a night for XXXX nights totaling a hotel reimbursement in the amount of {$170.00}. Per diem for food is $ XXXX/day/person. For XXXX people over a 4 day period that brings the total food reimbursement to {$600.00}. 
This brings the total reimbursement to just under {$1400.00}. 
We have already agreed to refund your appraisal fee in the amount of {$460.00}, which is currently in process. You are also going to be receiving your Close On Time Commitment Payout in the amount of {$500.00}. This brings the total reimbursement that is already in process to {$960.00}. In order to bring us to the {$1400.00} total, we will be issuing you a check in the amount of {$440.00} to cover the difference. 
{$620.00} ( mileage ) + {$170.00} ( lodging ) + {$600.00} ( food cost ) = {$1300.00} ( Rounded up to {$1400.00} ) {$1400.00} ( agreed reimbursement ) - {$460.00} ( appraisal refund in process ) - {$500.00} ( COTC in process ) = {$440.00} We will issue this check to the new address. Can you please confirm this is where you would like to have this mailed? 
Thank you very much and have a nice weekend! 
Sincerely, Consumer Lending Client Experience '' As you can see they created a final reimbursement figure by taking one issue, the travel reimbursement and then subtracting the "" in-process '' reimbursements. My strong contention is that there are three separate and distinct issues to be reimbursed. The three issues would total {$2300.00}. By doing a subtraction of two previous reimbursements for different issues they have substantially reduced their total payout. I find such an action to be cheap, insulting and a truly unprofessional way to address the needs of an aggrieved party to a horrific mortgage loan process as reviewed in my letter to the president ( attached ). A financial institution with the reach and impact that Bank of America has must be held to a higher standard and account for its actions."
Mortgage,"I had a mortgage through Bank of America. I was told by B of A that if I stopped making the payments for 3 months they would modify my loan and lower the payments, after not making the payments like I was advised B of A stated I did not qualify for a modification and actually raised the house payment to where I could not make the payment. I knew other people that had this same situation and they just stayed in the house until the bank forced them to leave. I left this was not right and I left the house and moved into a rental ( have supporting documents to show I was not living in the house ). Over the years I kept receiving phone calls and correspondence from multiple banks and/or mortgage companies wanting me to pay what I owed. I stated several times that I had left the residence and to please just foreclose on the property that I was not moving back in. In XXXX my husband and I were looking into purchasing a home. The mortgage company involved pulled my credit and stated I owed XXXX on my house. I stated that I no longer lived there and the house had since been sold and people were living in it. I contacted the mortgage company that was listed on my credit report and told them they had since sold the house so how could I owe them any money. I also stated that I had not been at the residence since XXXX and why was in not showing foreclosed? They stated they had just taken over the loan and that they showed the house did actually foreclose back in XXXX XXXX and they would update it on my credit, I also asked them how come it did not show a foreclosure sooner since I had left the residence back in XXXX? They stated they did n't know why they had just taken over the loan. My credit was updated and it reflected that the house foreclosed in XXXX. I tried to complain to the Mortgage company that I left the house in XXXX and that it caused me further delay to purchase a house because they missed foreclosing when I actually left, but no one would help me. I was then told I could purchase in a house in XXXX XXXX because it would have then been 3 years since the foreclosure, so once again I went this week to purchase the house I have been living in for 3 years and was advised that a mortgage company filed an Mortgage Insurance claim in XXXX XXXX for the me leaving the house. NOW I am being told I can not purchase a house until 3 years from that date? B of A has actually taken a foreclosure that should have only effected me purchasing a new house and know has make it to where I can not obtain a house for 9 years. This process should have been resolved and showed foreclosed back in XXXX and now I am being told I can not purchase a house until XXXX of XXXX. I will be forced to move from the house I am in with my children because of this and do not feel this is right. I was honest and moved out and did not live there for free. I need to know what action can be taken if any?"
Mortgage,"Me my wife applied for Mortgage loan at Bank Of America. They told me that they will give me the loan amount I asked if I buy a house in a certain zip code. I told them I want to buy a house in XXXX XXXX MD and specifically in Zip Code XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. They told me they will not give me a loan to buy in those zip codes. They said that they will give me a loan if I buy in certain zip codes only. We have excellent credit score, have assets more than the loan amount. The reason they don't want us to buy in those zip codes is that they said my wife have only one line of credit even she have more than 700 credit score which is excellent. For me I look it like this. Most poor people don't have more than one credit card ( line of of credit ) and they want those people to buy only in certain zip codes may be they don't want them to live in good neighborhood. 
The loan office is : XXXX XXXX. 
e-mail : XXXX Phone : XXXX His manger is XXXX XXXX e-mail : XXXX Phone XXXX. 
I talked to the manger and and he told me the same reason. Also the manger told me that even we have good income, good credit score and enough asset for down payment and so on, we are still risk borrower. We are XXXX XXXX and we emigrated to this country and we suspect that is the reason they don't want to loan to us. 
I have e-mail that I received from the loan officer for refusal to get loan in those zip codes. 
Thanks,"
Mortgage,"Our mortgage is through Bank of America. We had a leak in our home that resulted in an insurance claim. Because the amount to fix the damage of our house exceeds 20K, we need Bank of America 's endorsement on the check. After overnighting the check to be processed over a month ago and several calls (XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, & XX/XX/XXXX ) we are still stuck in their process.

XXXX should examine Bank of America 's lack of service and accountability in this situation. BOA eagerly takes our business and originates the mortgage loan but does not have the support staff in place to assist their clients when something like this happens. This results in us, their borrower, stuck in limbo without money to start work on repairing our home. It also translates to my family, with three young children, unnecessarily out of our home and in a hotel for an extra amount of time until BOA moves forward issuing a check. 

After not hearing anything, I called on XX/XX/XXXX to see where they were in the process. I was told that our contractor 's XXXX was filled out incorrectly and needed to be resubmitted. When I asked if they would have called me and told me this, they said no. They do not make out going calls. There is no follow through on their end to let the consumer know that the XXXX needs to be resubmitted. I asked to email over the corrected XXXX and they said fax or snail mail are the only ways to submit it. I called back again to ensure that the new one was correct and they still only had the incorrect one. I refaxed the correct XXXX 3 times and after following up repeatedly to make sure they had it, I was told on XX/XX/XXXX to just email it. 

They have confirmed that it is now moving forward at an "" escalated '' pace ( at least 48hr to  approve the check still and another 48hrs to print the check before it will be mailed. ) I expect so much more of Bank of America and hope that you can assist in having this process changed as it has been awful for me and my family."

Not XXXX applied to principal. This loan will never be paid off in this manner. My monthly income comes from the renting of XXXX of the properties and I reside in the other. The HELOC was taken out against the property that is being rented. I spoke to them again today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) about converting the HELOC into a regular mortgage so that my monthly payments would include both interest and principal and they informed me that when the HELOC matures in XXXX, the HELOC will convert into a regular mortgage. I am XXXX and my husband is XXXX. I fear that the bank keeps refusing to refinance my HELOC simply because they want to collect 2 more years of interest from me. On 5 different occasions I 've had some extra money and mailed it in to be applied to the principal of the HELOC. The payment coupon has a space for you to write the amt for principal only. Yet, BOA would never apply it to the HELOC at all. The additional funds sent would be held in a "" floating status '' and then eventually be applied to our XXXX mortgage. How in the world can they apply funds to a XXXX mortgage account when they were to be applied to a HELOC account?!!! Each account has a different number! The pymnt coupon has everything clearly notated. There is no reason that they should not refinance my HELOC. We 've been a customer from XXXX thru XXXX with our XXXX mortgage. We made 36 yrs of pymnts & were never late. Half of our monthly income of {$2500.00} from the rental goes to the HELOC & the other half is used for food, utilities and medical expenses. We are simply trying to live our last years and be able to take care of each other. We are being taken advantage of & need your help."
Mortgage,"My mortgage is serviced by Bank of America. I have a reoccurring payment set up and have for a number of years. This year I got a letter saying my payment was late and they were going to charge me a fee. 

I never canceled this autopayment. 

So after calling them and nobody could tell me why this happened, they credited me the fee, and I made a manual payment and they said the auto payments will resume. 

I checked for my XXXX payment, and the auto paymets show "" Canceled '' I called them, and nobody knows why. They keep canceling my auto pay. 


I believe they are committing fraud by coming up with scenarios to charge fees, hoping we don't find out, like XXXX XXXX has done."
Mortgage,Bank of America is my investor for my XXXX mortgage and XXXX XXXX is my servicer. No one seems to be able to tell me why I did n't qualify for the National Mortgage Settlement to lower my principal or get refinanced for a lower interest for my XXXX mortgage that is owned by Bank of America. I would like to be able to refinance for today 's low rates per the settlement agreement. I keep getting the run around and was actually told by a Bank of America employee that Bank of America does not own any loans and that I must be mistaken.
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2023 I received a letter from Bank of America stating they have removed PMI based on a loan to value of less than 80 %. 

I requested to have escrow removed based on XXXX of less than 80 %. 


I received a letter from Bank of America XXXX department stating my XXXX was 96 %. 

You remove PMI based on XXXX of less than 80 % but Bank of America XXXX department denied removing escrow based on XXXX 96 %. 

For Bank of America to hold my escrow account XXXX sounds like it benefits then financially. 

I requested the escrow removal on one day and the next day I receive this standard form letter with denial due to equity being 96 %. 

What kind of bank is this that operates like a scam. 

Bank of America is contradicting itself. The right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing.

Mortgage,"I am in a bit of a quagmire as I would describe it. My wife an I lost our jobs in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively. She has since started working while I had to stay home and take care of my mother who just passed in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX. The mortgage fell behind, and the bank has filed foreclosure. I am trying to work with them. However, they are being very dishonest, and deliberately misleading. I explained to my account manager from bank of America that I was taking my mother XXXX back to the XXXX as she had requested. However, I would be willing to miss my mother 's funeral in order to bring my mortgage current. I asked what did I need to do to make my mortgage current. I was told that I needed to pay the past due along with all fees which would include the attorney 's fees. My account manager explained that she could not give me an exact amount nor an estimate because the attorney 's fees had not yet been calculated. She recommended the I should apply for a modification while I waited for the fees to be calculated. She also informed me that based on the fact that I have had XXXX previous modifications with in the last five years that I would not qualify. She recommended doing a reinstatement. she explained that I would be required to pay half of the past due amount, while making the other half over the next six months along with the regular payments. I agreed. My account manager explained that income documentation would be required in order to make sure that I would be able to afford the payments for the six months. I told her that I would have to call back based on the information that she wanted. I made several attempts to reach my account manager to complete the request but was unsuccessful. 

I carried my mother XXXX home and upon my immediate return I contacted the bank. I explained to the representative that picked up that I was trying to reach my account manager and was unsuccessful and that I was an urgent matter. he reviewed the file and said that he would be able to collect the information on her behalf. I submitted the information and was told that she would follow up with me shortly. 
After about a week I received a letter stating that a box on the XXXX was not checked so I need to resubmit the XXXX. I did so immediately and submitted it on the bank portal. I followed up with bank and was told the modification was still in process. I was very surprised because it was suppose to be a reinstatement not a modification, and I was told that the reinstatement would be a quick turn around. I called my account manager repeatedly until eventually I reached her. I explained my concerns at which time she told me that was done in error. she said that I should make it go through and see what happens. once again I explained my desire to make this current immediately because I was very concerned about all the mails that I was getting from different attorneys. I again asked how much was it to bring the mortgage current. She said that she would have to submit a request which I should receive with in 30 days. She said that nothing would happen as long as there is a modification in process. Last night at XXXX I answered the door only to be served with a summons. I called the bank today to reach my account manager to find out what was going on. She was out to lunch. I was greeted by an individual who thought was a joke. I was told by him that it was my responsibility to bring my mortgage current. I explained that I have been trying to do so for some time now, but I could never get the amount need to do so. I asked him if he knew what that amount was, to which he replied no, and that he would have to submit a request. I asked him to do so. He then said that he was unable to because one was submitted already. All I have been trying to do is make my mortgage current."
Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/15 I applied for a home equity line of credit ( "" HELOC '' ) online from Bank of America ( "" BofA '' ). The following week I received a telephone call from BofA regarding my HELOC application. One of the questions asked by the BofA employee was "" do you have have any other loan requests pending ''. I answered truthfully, which was yes I had applied for an identical HELOC from XXXX XXXX a day after I applied to BofA. BofA informed me that they would NOT continue with my HELOC application until I provided them a letter from XXXX XXXX indicating that I had withdrawn my HELOC application from XXXX XXXX. I indicated to BofA that I was willing to withdraw my application from XXXX XXXX but only after I had received a loan commitment from BofA. BofA has unwilling to do this and canceled my application. BofA did this despite me being a 20 yr customer ( premier status ) with existing checking, savings and HSA accounts at BofA and a XXXX credit score. This practice by BofA is anti-consumer. It limits shopping for competitive rates and terms. It forces you to either shop for a loan sequentially versus in parallel, which is time consuming at best, lie to BofA during the application process, or find another lender."
Mortgage,"I co-own a property that I took a home equity loan on with Bank of America ( BOA ). The property taxes were supposed to be paid by myself and the other party. I paid my share, they did not. BOA contacted me informing me that taxes must be paid to protect their interest. I was initially given XXXX days to resolve the issue but was told I could call to request an additional XXXX days if needed before they would open an escrow account and pay the taxes. I immediately went to my attorney and went through a refinance of my current property to obtain the funds to pay off the loan so the property taxes would no longer be of concern to BOA and remain the burden of the "" other party ''. I went through a lot to get the refinance done within the additional XXXX days that were granted ( giving me until XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) meetings, paperwork, appraisal and closing costs. When I had the funds available to pay off the loan ( still prior to XXXX XXXX ) I contacted BOA and they told me they went ahead and opened the escrow account and paid the taxes sometime the first week of XXXX! I was shocked and dismayed and was basically told I was out of luck. The burden was now on me and even though I would be paying off the principal amount, a portion would go to the escrow leaving a principal balance still open and therefore not only making me liable for the previous taxes but setting me up to be responsible for any future taxes the other party would likely not be paying as well! My husband is permanently XXXX with XXXX issues and I really can not afford to pay someone else 's bills! Also, we take pride in our good credit and this could ruin us. Their "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' wo n't even return my calls."
Mortgage,"I live in Florida, since we had XXXX XXXX I heard on TV that the banks will provide a relief to Owners in order to wave three monthly mortgage payment, I called Bank Of America who own my mortgage and they explained that I will to pay a lump sum on XXXX, the three monthly payments and the fourth Monthly ( XXXX ), I request help because I can not pay my next mortgage Payment and they provide only postpone the payments but immediately due at the fourth month, I request to the representative of Bank Of America to get in writing the terms of that relief and he refused to provide the terms in writing, he said, if you agree I can set up this temporary change, but I have to trust only verbally what he says is all about, I wonder if I can not pay the whole amount in XXXX what will be the consequence since no documents in writing are available. 
I think this bank is not really interested in provide in these hard times any kind of relief because what they offer is not really help to the people in needs right now, Please I beg your help in this matter to try to get the helping hand we really need, thanks so much."
Mortgage,"I applied for a mortgage loan through Bank of America for the purchase of a home. I was approved and the rate was locked. In order to close the escrow, I had to liquidate large amount of investment in a brokerage account. One day before the settlement date, I was instructed to wire the funds to the escrow company and the arrangement was being made to proceed. Then the bank informed me that the loan is not being approved because they determined that I had a second home and I would have to pay a higher rate. I had a second home but it was going to be converted into an investment property and the newly purchased home would become a second home. However, this was all known by the bank from the beginning of the process as everything was disclosed on the application. As a result, I could n't proceed with the purchase and suffered a significant damage."
Mortgage,"When my husband passed away years ago he always handled our finances. When I met my new husband he started to check on our finances and was shocked to discover we owed {$12000.00} in back property taxes from XXXX through XXXX for XXXX County XXXX.. We paid them on XX/XX/XXXX during the COVID pandemic and spent six months trying to find my late husband 's records to see why Bank of America had not paid these out of our escrow payments. 

Then in XXXX of this year, we sold the house and were told prior to closing we owed an ADDITIONAL {$11000.00} in property taxes for the same period to XXXX County. After this shock, we stopped by a branch to get the missing payment records. The mortgage had since been sold to XXXX XXXX  in XXXX (? ) and they had paid the taxes promptly ever since. 

We formally requested Bank of America, by phone, XXXX for all the records covering the mortgage since XXXX when we first bought the property. We called on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX and both times received spotty records that did NOT cover the years XXXX through XXXX. 

We are requesting you to find out what happened to the escrow accounts and where the money went? Who is responsible for the interest and penalties?"
Mortgage,"Bank of America failed to make Verbally full disclosure its Loan Modification practices and procedures. The issue concerning negative credit reporting was never Verbally discussed or disclosed, however, it is in the contract. This practice of not Verbally disclosing all of the information concerning their Loan Modification practices and procedures is deceptive and fraudulant. It is never fully Verbally explained that during their Loan Modification process the post mortgage payment is protected from negative credit reporting but the pre-mortgage payment is not. Therefore, their not Verbally communicating all aspects of their Loan Modification process is fraudulent and deceptive. I am asking a full investigation into Bank of America 's Loan Modification practices and procedures. From XXXX to XXXX I have been a participated in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America loan modifications and at no time was it ever explained to me Verbally, the negative aspects of their process. My argument is not in the paperwork that bears my signature but in the fact that negative credit reporting of the pre-loan modification mortgage payment and the post loan modification mortgage payment was never discussed. I know that I should have read the contract through, but since negative credit reporting was never ever explained to me as being a part of their loan modification process ; all of the documents that I signed and had witnessed and notarized was done in "" good faith ''. I am asking that the FHA intervene and that the scripts that are being used by the agents and representatives of Bank of America be seized and investigated so that no one else will be deceived about every aspect of their loan modification process. I am attaching their final resolution as well as my XXXX credit reports ; with particular note to their "" Summary of our research '' section of their letter of explanation ; where they stand by their decision not agree with my request for credit restoration and credit score worthiness."
Mortgage,"The homeowner is requesting assistance from the mortgage company - Bank of America. The homeowner fell behind due to a loss of income when she lost her job. She struggled to keep up the payments but became delinquent. She tried to get assistance from Bank of America, but was unsuccessful. Her income has now improved and she desperately wants to keep her home. She contacted a HUD approved housing counseling agency for assistance. The agency reviewed her finances, the Request for Modification Assistance ( RMA ) application and other supporting documentation before sending the package to BOA. The homeowner was denied a modification and the reason given was "" we service your loan on behalf of an investor that has not given us the contractual authority to modify your loan. '' The investor XXXX. In trying to reach XXXX, she was told they do not instruct lenders on modifications and the decision is completely up to the lender. An appeal was made to BOA and another RMA application was submitted. However, the response has been the same."
Mortgage,"I had wind storm damage done to a property that I own last fall. I am not going to repair the house, it is just not worth it with the insurance pay out. The insurance company sent me a settlement check. I contact Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, 2016 regarding sending this check in and having it applied to the principal balance on my load so I could then pay off the balance and sell the property. I was told to sign the check and mail it in to the property claims department along with a letter of intent to have the funds applied to the principal of the loan. I folded the check up in the letter of intent. The check was received on XXXX XXXX, 2016 but after two phone calls they could not find the letter. Then I was told on XXXX XXXX, 2016 that everything was all set and it would take up to 14 days to process and that I would get a payoff letter in the mail. I waited until XXXX XXXX, 2016 and still had not received anything so I called again. XXXX with XXXX XXXX and they had no record of my letter of intent. Said I needed to send in another letter, resulting in yet another delay of 5-7 business days. I asked if I could email it and after arguing about it they agreed I could email. I emailed the letter right away and I also faxed a copy. I call on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to follow up and was told by XXXX XXXX that the letter needed to have an actual signature and not an email signature. If this was the case why could n't they have called me back right away and let me know there was an issue. So on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I sent in a revised letter of intent with the required signature. XXXX said that she filed a complaint for me and that it would take 5 days to process the request. I called back on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to follow up and make sure they had everything that was required to get this payment processed. Spoke with XXXX and then XXXX in Escalation and they informed me that they had no update yet and that it could take up to 7 business days to process and that XXXX XXXX, 2016 was the first time any notes on my request to pay down the mortgage were recorded in their system. When I asked why and where were the notes from all of my other calls they were unable to answer. I called again on XXXX XXXX, 2016, spoke with XXXX, and again nothing had been processed. I did finally receive a call from an "" executive '', XXXX, in the escalation department and he stated that my previous letter requesting the fund be applied to the principal balance was wrong and that it should state that I want the funds to go towards the payoff of the loan. So now I question is this going to take yet another 5-7 days to process and he said no that it would be 24-48 hours and that I would receive and email with my payoff information. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016 I still had not received any information nor has the payment been posted to my account. I called yet again and was told by XXXX that I was told wrong and that it would be 5-7 business days to process, the request was being submitted again and she put in a request for a manager to call me, maybe within 24-48 hours. So now it has been a month since they received my check for quite a substantial amount. They are earning interest on my money while charging me interest at the same time. The property is in the process of being sold and this is holding up the sale while more damage is being done to the house as it sits. This is also holding up the purchase of a new property. It should not take 30 days for them to process a mortgage payment, that is beyond excessive. I have serious issues as to why I keep getting the run around and being told something different every time that I call them in order to prolong this process. Not one person seems to have any idea what they are doing or what is required to get this done. Are they not required to process payments as of the date they are received? Am I not entitled to a payoff statement upon request?"
Mortgage,"In XXXX, We refinanced our mortgage through XXXX XXXX which sold it to Countrywide which was absorbed by Bank of America. After having our second child we tried to sell our home to find something larger to no avail as the market came crumbling down. Bank of America ignored our calls and requests for over 12 months regarding loss mitigation options. Finally they told us they could n't discuss any options with us because we were current. In XX/XX/XXXX we stopped paying the Mortgage. We were told by Bank of America that we needed to find buyers if we wanted a Short Sale and we did on multiple occasions only to have BOA back out or not respond. We were forced to repeat this process numerous times to no avail. After we found a larger property to rent, Bank of America changed the locks barring us from entering the property XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX. We still tried to work with them but every 2 months they would say they were missing paperwork and the process needed to start over from scratch. In XX/XX/XXXX we filed Bankruptcy hoping that would give us a reprieve from BOA and the largely upside down property. We were discharged from bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX. Unbeknownst to us, We now do not qualify for a new mortgage because A. we have a recent bankruptcy B. the property is still in my wife 's name ( even though the locks have been changed ) C. We get demand letters from the Condo Association regarding unpaid fees ( as BOA still has yet to foreclose the property ). 
We want to move on with our lives but there does not seem to be a way to do so ... Furthermore we will not qualify as 1st time home buyers when our Bankruptcy discharge hits 3 years, because BOA has refused to finalize the process they started 6 years ago."
Mortgage,"I do n't know why you refuse to help people. Seems to me you make lots of false claims and do litte to actually help recify the growning racketeering that has arisin again. I had XXXX loans initially with XXXX firm that was allegedly purchased by a huge firm, but NO one can provide an fact regarding a RESPA Request. 
They ca n't do this, although they have tried with XXXX different lawfirms that try to intimidate people but are very carful on the working in their letters. What is really sad but very important and revealing is the fact that these law firms have had their problems with foreclosure litigation against them. 
These "" pretend '' servicers-lenders are very very ticky and know how to create smoke and mirrors as well as being great at deceiving people with their mailings. Most have "" paper mills '' that put out the fabricated, forged, phony, and even "" robo-signed '' signatures and notaries!! Even many local trustee/recordrs are way to sloppy in not asking for proof before recordings. 
My most recent encounter is with a very nasty lender I have been fighting for five ( 5 ) years on XXXX loans and this company has well over 40,000 complaints logged against it through CFPB- so there is really something wrong here when you send a person like me a letter and say the "" other party responded '' and we have closed the case based upon the mere lender 's reply and response with some of the phony documents attached. 
I have undisputed proof on all XXXX loans that they no longer existed after the first company was bought out. There is also a recent ruling against racketeering here in Colorado in the XXXX Circuit Court Ruling in XXXX et al. v. XXXX XXXX and Bank of America issued on XX/XX/2016 and the CFPB even ignores this and thousands of cases against this company which shows just how corrupt our system is and the fact that our very own government is in on all this racketeering. Otherewise they would be taking positive action to issue a nationwide moratorium on foreclosure so things do n't get out of hand again like in the past. 
I hope the new administration finally disbands the useless, dysfuntional, and questionable CFPB and many others. It is truly time for change in my humble opinion."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has reported to the credit bureaus I was late 120-180 days mortgage payments for each XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. Contacted them and they asked for bank records that dispute their reporting. I provided it XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and they responded that they were not going to change their reported although the bank records indicated I was on time and actually a month ahead by mid XXXX. They suggested we take it up with the credit agencies. This has not only impacted my credit score buy my ability to secure another home. Currently trying to contact XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX to mitigate the negative situation. Numerous attempts with BOA failed to achieve any resolution. Will never do business with them again."

Mortgage,"Bank Of American employees asked for documentation that was not needed and placed their name on my insurance Policy before the loan was processed and closed.

My home has over XXXX Dollars worth of equity in it to secure a {$50.00}. Loan. I have Good Credit. I did apply to buy a New Home and they were informed by my Insurance Company XXXX I own other property and assumed I wanted to buy a new house.

They did not have the right to place their name on my Insurance Policy or request information on other property to attach their names to Insure the Loan. This is Discrimination in the worst form to Steal from a XXXX XXXX. I was told they needed this information to prove I was not hiding money.

I was told the Loan was approved and would be closing soon. After not hearing anything for some time I called and was told the application was closed due to lack of information.

Mortgage,"Was applying to have my name added to my mother 's mortgage and amazingly, was rejected. Here are the facts. I work for a XXXX XXXX company, make well over {$68000.00} a year, have a 700+ credit score, and have a car that 's fully paid off worth about {$14000.00}, and have {$56000.00} sitting in a B of A bank, the bank that turned me down. Moreover, we had $ XXXX in equity in the home so if we didnt pay, the bank would still get all its money back and more. 

My mother also has good credit, receives about {$2100.00} a month from SS, and has {$13000.00} sitting in just one of her bank accounts and thousands more sitting in others. 

Here 's why we got rejected. XXXX XXXX, the B of A rep, underreported my income by about 50 %, did n't even come close to listing all of my assets or my mother 's, listed the house as having been bought in XX/XX/XXXX, instead of XX/XX/XXXX, listed the purchase price as {$100000.00} instead of as {$79000.00}, had the wrong address on the loan, and charged me $ 500+ for an appraisal that never took place and which she originally was not going to refund. XXXX also listed my marital status as single, a lower credit rating, instead of married, a higher credit rating. Nor did she even ask about my wife 's income -about {$45000.00} a year. I emailed her several times telling her of these discrepancies, but she insisted I just follow her instructions and everything would be alright. Well, it was n't. The loan got rejected. 

I have several emails documenting my corrections of XXXX 's data and of XXXX 's insisting I just submit the paperwork as it was. Attached is but one of them. If need be, I will gladly submit the rest. This one, however, seems to say it all."
Mortgage,"I called Bank of America XX/XX/2021 asking how much I owed for the 5 months "" deferment '' that I was approved for only to find out it was a forbearance that required the entire balance to be paid at the end of the agreement term. I submitted a complaint previously in reference to how the repayment assistance program was a complete XXXX and was ultimately unable to work out any arrangements with the company. So, in XX/XX/2021, I called to get the total amount owed so I could repay and was advised I had a sum of money sitting in an unpaid balance account. I submitted a request to have the funds applied to the principal mortgage for the intended two months I called and paid it for, and two weeks later I was advised my request had been denied. I have had several conversations with multiple BOA representatives and each of them have a different explanation as to how that has happened and what the resolution is but none of them have been successful with assisting me in resolving my issue. 

XXXX XXXX, I was advised to pay {$6100.00} and the {$2000.00} that was sitting in the unapplied funds account would be corrected as well. I called XX/XX/2021 and the account is still saying I owe over {$9000.00} of payments which is not correct. The Service Request # is : XXXX and I submitted a request for that on XXXX XXXX and it has still not been resolved. I called today to speak with the person who took the payment with confirmation number : XXXX ( SS ) and have been transferred to multiple people still resulting in no one being able to assist me with getting these funds applied to my principal mortgage payments. The payment made on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX in the system should have brought my account to a {$0.00} balance yet Bank of America HAS NOT updated my account status and it has been several months since I stopped working on a repayment plan with the company at their dismissal. 

As a Customer I have found dealing with Bank of America extremely frustrating and counterproductive. I feel that I have experienced heightened stress and undue emotional distress because my mortgage is on the line and no one seems to be able to give the same answer more than once. I have asked that my Account Manager call me, no one has. I have asked that someone, anyone who can assist with this level of an issue call me and set the account straight especially now that I have made the required payment and all I get is one transferred call after the next when calling BOA."

Bank of America intentionally returned the funds to XXXX in order to exact a {$40.00} fee in addition to XXXX {$20.00} wire fee. All excuses specific to why the funds were returned were blatant lies, lies in retaliation for a prior complaint that I filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against XXXX and Bank of America. 

Even though the theft of my {$60.00} is disheartening, having to go to a XXXX branch and be forced to argue with a XXXX employee about poorly trained XXXX employees was a very scary time for me. A XXXX man, arguing with a XXXX  woman in a bank caused me to be in fear for my life. 

Moreover, if your employees needed a laugh and decided to have fun with the XXXX, then, I sincerely hope that your employees have satiated their constant cravings for XXXX amusement. Ha! Ha! Ha! .You have a nice home and a financially rewarding job. Do you really need to XXXX me in order to acquire more money?

Mortgage,About 2 years ago I reached out to you twice for some assistance dealing with Bank of America as they refused to work with me on several of thier options to prevent foreclosure for which i qualified. I lost the property but just received a check from them for XXXX dollars because they wrote that they may not have provided me with the level of service I deserved.
Mortgage,I received notification of a shortfall in my escrow. In XXXX I made my regular payment ( or thou I thought ) I made two payments for the shortfall and my regular payment. My bill comes for XXXX and it is not adjusted. I call and I am on hold for 30 minutes and disconnected. I call again and was told I was being transferred and would not be placed on hold and put on hold for another 40 minutes. Finally I am talking to a representative of the bank and they say they can't tell me the exact amount owed for my payment. It will take 3 days for the back office to recalculate to include the escrow and then I have to call back and find out the payment. If these banks using the current technology can't tell me what my payment is how am I suppose to avoid late fees. This waiting on on the phone for hours is not acceptable. I am paying for a service and if they cant provide me with the service they need to pay me for the time I am sitting on hold.
Mortgage,"We settled a short sale agreement with Bank of America Home loan on both first and second mortgage and sold our home on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX through escrow and the title company wired funds to BAnk of America and paid off the XXXX loans. 
However Bank of America turned around and sold the second mortgage, which we had paid off back in XXXX to XXXX in XXXX and we got collection notice in XXXX from XXXX. We 've called and submitted closing & pay-off statement/documentation on both loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to both financial institutions to get this resolved and filed official complaints. But we were either got ignored or told that it was not their problem. XXXX is sending us collection letters and negatively reporting us to the credit bureau on a mortgage that we paid and satisfied and it should not even be existed. 
Our credits were ruined badly and we are deeply distressed by this."
Mortgage,"On   XX/XX/XXXX ,   Hurricane   XXXX  destroyed my home. I was evacuated and currently reside in FEMA transitional housing. I contacted Bank of America,  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  in   XX/XX/XXXX  to  notify them I  FEMA  evacuated me, rendered my home dangerous and uninhabitable. I also gave them a copy of the City of  XXXX  storm water report,  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  report and NC  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  report. In short, when the  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  levy broke, the water eroded the ground under my home and its now falling off a cliff.   Bank of America has continued to FORECLOSE my property knowing that the home is on the FEMA but out list in  XXXX  NC. There predatory lending practices and negligent updating of my records has ruined my credit and no one will rent me and kids a home. Ive been Homeless sinc e  XX/XX/XXXX . Ive asked for a Discharge of this Debt and they refused and s erved me toda y  XX/XX/XXXX  with Foreclosure paperwork. Bank of America is forcing to pay for a   condemned home when they can Discharge the Debt due to  Hurricane   XXXX .      XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  also failed me miserably. I signed forms for them to assist and advocate for me and they DID NOT facilitate my request. My worker  XXXX   XXXX  refused to follow  NC Disaster Legal Service  rules for Natural Disaster even when I told him to do so and provided him the steps. He requested I sign a short sale form for my home with "" NO '' resale value. That neglect action furthered my Foreclosure status. They are contracted by NC and receive funds to help  Hurricane    XXXX  Victims and that 's not being done by  XXXX   XXXX . He should be reprimanded for making such fatal mistakes.     My credit and my life has been ruined due to these agencies. I cant rent or buy another home. At no time should a condemned home on the FEMA ACQUISTION LIST be foreclosed on. We lost enough and now Ive lost the ability to rebuild my life. I 'm a  XXXX  Veteran with  XXXX  kids and I just want my own place to live again and stability for my kids. The agencies were suppose to help and instead they 've destroyed my sanity, credit and lively hood. Ive been diagnosed with  XXXX  and  XXXX  since  Hurricane    XXXX .      XXXX   XXXX  has also ruined my credit and failed to protect Hurricane  XXXX  victims. I turned in my Van due to  Hurricane    XXXX  damage and they listed on my credit as a volunteer repossession. I called them to come get if because of storm damage. I want that debt discharged too. I should n't have to pay for that.     PLEAE HELP ME!!! PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS , IM TIERD OF FIG HTING THEM TO DO RIGHT BY ME.      XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  loan #  XXXX  email :  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX"
Mortgage,BofA did not post my payment correctly in XXXX of 2011. This resulted in me being labeled as delinquent. They then posted me as delinquent for the next 8 months as 60-89 days late. They refused to speak with me on the matter. This has had a tremendous negative effect on my credit score.
Mortgage,"A summary and history of the loan major actions is provided as an attachment. 
I was not provided information and application for a modification under the Department of Justice National Mortgage Settlement Act. I previous applied for consideration under the Foreclosure Fraud Program XXXX Case number XXXX ) and received compensation while this loan was assigned ( supposedly XXXX to Bank of America. There is strong evidence that there has been robo signing and false citing of the securitization bundling on the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I received notification packages from Bank of America to apply for the National Mortgage Settlement modification. I attempted to contact Bank of America to do so. I was told that the loan had been transferred to XXXX XXXX and to contact them for processing. XXXX did not show that they had the loan ( there is an error in the timeline on the transfer of the loan - it was SIGNED as transferred in XX/XX/XXXX, NO NOTIFICATION was sent out as required prior to the signing and the notification actually came out in XX/XX/XXXX, with the then actual transfer date showing as XX/XX/XXXX XXXX That confusion carried over to discussions with XXXX -- They indicated that they did not offer the National Mortgage Settlement Program because they were not included in the legal suits brought against the individual lenders. They denied me the right to modify the loan and would not provide information on how to apply. I have since talked to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the case manager for my loan when it XXXX was transferred to XXXX. She told me that the case was specifically coded as being eligible for the National Mortgage Settlement program and specifically assigned to her because of her expertise and ability to work the modifications. However, she did agree that they did not reach out to me, did not send me ANY NOTIFICATIONS and did not follow their own normal procedures for ensuring customers were advised of the program and attempting to submit applications or at least contacting them concerning the program. She could not explain why they had denied my repeated attempts to apply for the program. She indicated that she would send me copies of all notes and correspondence going back to the beginning of the loan transferred in. Then, they denied that and would only send up to XX/XX/XXXX and stated that I would have to go to court to get any of the other. As the timeline drew near I increased my querries into applying for the program. I was repeatedly told that BOA had to approve the application and that they would inquire about that but that an upcoming letter from BOA had instructed them they were ceasing all application and to not process them. Follow up a week later indicated that XXXX representatives had NOT followed up with contacting BOA and we had to go thru all the discussions with still another representative for at least XXXX to l hour to rediscover the action and then to only be told that I needed to submit the request in writing but that they did not offer modifications under the National Mortgage Settlement Act program at all. Still more requests thruout the entire timeframe with the same general outcome. The refused to allow me to apply for modification under the program."
Mortgage,"We are trying to get BOA to waive late charges and past due interest so that we can pay off the Home Equity loan. We have been in this home 15 years and never paid a late payment on our first mortgage. The problem started with the balloon came due and the payments were more than our first mortgage and higher than what we could afford with the first and second. We contacted BOA at that time XX/XX/2015 to try and combine both as they had both loans. They would not agree to combine but the first agreed to refinance us through the Harp Program. The second assigned us a case manager which seemed to always be away or missing appointment times that they scheduled. We were surprised to get an agreement in the mail saying we agreed to 5 increased payments that we could not afford nor had we even had a discussion about. We got money from our credit union to bring the loan current but the problem was still there as we could not afford. It 's very difficult to speak with someone and after several more attempts and trying to make the payments that were too high we just decided to sell our home that we love. In trying to speak with a person to relay this information the next information we got in the mail was the intent to foreclose. What we 're asking now and still can not get assistance as we 're getting pushed through the phone maze again and no one will take ownership and our case manager XXXX XXXX was not available, we actually had XXXX in collections ask if we considered a deed in lieu, I was shocked as we 're trying to pay them off which is why I was calling them today. We need them to stop treating us differently due to our age and race. 1. We need a payoff on the XXXX mortgage without the past due interest and late charges, the last balance I showed was {$47000.00} 2. Since the sale of our home would be enough to pay off the XXXX and the XXXX, we need them to remove all late from our credit score so that we can qualify for another home. It a bad situation that can be resolved but we do n't want to be prevented from purchasing another home as a result of us making many attempts to resolve this situation."
Mortgage,"Recently my husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX and myself recently began paying ahead on our Mortgage and now Bank of America wants to take our money and apply to the Principal after we have directed payments to be applied directly to the next outstanding monthly payment. I, XXXX XXXX paid the XXXX Payment in the amount of XXXX online via our online Bank of America Account on XX/XX/XXXX and this payment was to cure the XX/XX/XXXX Payment and after I physically directed the funds to apply to the XXXX payment, BOA applied the payment to Principal and it was approximately 15 days before it was reversed and corrected, the last person I spoke with at BOA informed me that this should not happen again. I informed that person that I somebody should have to contact us if they are unsure about what to do with the payment and was kindly told that they could not do that, it would take too much time and there was not any other place to send the funds, they had to be applied to something. XXXX is XXXX  XXXX and the nearest branch is 35 miles away considering that we no longer have a local branch here in the county that we live in. With that being said, I then proceeded to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment which was paid online via the website on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX and there was not any problem, I assumed that the problem in question had been resolved considering that the XX/XX/XXXX payment was now cured with XX/XX/XXXX being the next payment due but on XX/XX/XXXX I made the next payment of {$1100.00} and should have cured the XX/XX/XXXX Payment via online the BOA Website and the next business day, I noticed that the payment once again had been applied to Principal with the XX/XX/XXXX payment still outstanding and once again I have contacted BOA and stressed to them that we once again have directed where the funds were to be applied and I want the payment voided and reentered correctly and was kindly told that it didn't work that way and there was no time frame or limit as to when or how long the request could take. Legally unless they have written directions from us they should not be allowed to process any Mortgage payments to Principal without our permission. This is very Deceptive and I know why they do this due to the interest and we still show that the XX/XX/XXXX Payment is due but we dont have the money to send large amounts just for the Principal Payments, we do send Principal payments but nothing over {$100.00} has ever been mailed to apply to Principal. Now how can you assist us with getting this matter resolved and the payments being applied as if we were not 2 to 3 months ahead? That should be our prerogative how the funds should be applied not BOA 's. 
I have written the bank but have not received any response. We thought that this had been resolved on XX/XX/XXXX."
Mortgage,"Mortgage payment was made to Bank of America for my personal mortgage. The name on the check was made out to Bank of America. Bank of America did not give me credit for the money paid. Bank of America then reported me to all of the credit bureaus. Bank of America refuses to take responsibility for this cash check and not applied to my account. 
This has been going on since 2017."
Mortgage,"Got a letter from Bank of America saying they will no longer accept personal checks when paying my mortgage. They claim that they have "" received multiple checks over the past months that have been returned by my financial institution due to insufficient funds. '' I never had my check bounced. I feel that they are just harrassing me. I am not late in my mortgage payments. But they do call frequently to ask me when I will mail the payment. Now I get a letter that I have to pay by money order or cashier 's check."
Mortgage,I am a realtor representing my client and I have been trying since XXXX to initate in equator. They have even told me that I would be able to initiate in equator. We went through a modification in XXXX and the client does not want to do it. He wants to proceed with a short sale. Every time I call no one can ever do anything and you have to talk to management to be able to get you in the system.
Mortgage,"I have been denied access to the Home Loan Modification Status iportal for borrowers My Documents tab since XXXX XXXX, 2016 after submitting several documents. I have repeatedly requested my access to the Bank of America created, maintained and managed borrowers iportal, but my requests have been ignored. While I am able to log in to the borrowers iportal and access every other tabs, such as the My Application Status tab, I can not gain access to the My Documents tab page. Apparently Bank of America has locked me out and intentionally denied access to this tab page within the iportal. This intentional lock out and lack of access effectively prevents me from uploading documents, checking the status of my home loan mortgage account information including, but not limited to, the current modification status and who the currently assigned single point of contact is along with their contact information. 
Unblock and unlock the My Documents tab page within the borrowers Home Loan Modification Status iportal upon receipt of this request to do so and ensure that I am not denied full access to the entire borrowers Home Loan Modification Status iportal in the future. 
BLOCK AND LOCK OUT OF THE MY DOCUMENTS TAB ON IPORTAL"
Mortgage,"I 'm seeking your assistance on my mortgage with Bank of America. I 'm simply asking for help. My wife and I have been faced with both health and financial hardships over the last few years. We are finally in a state where we can sustain the monthly mortgage payment but Bank of America is running me in circles. I ask you to please-please truly review my situation as there has to be a human with a heart sitting somewhere willing to help me, willing to make an exception or simply sit back and realize this is the right thing to do. I am attaching a letter which thoroughly explains what has occurred."
Mortgage,Home retention servicing ongoing on servicing my mortgage. Should have stopped in XXXX. Nothing has been done
Mortgage,"This complaint is about my HELOC account with Bank of America and the lost payoff payment. I have two account with BofA : First Mortgage and HELOC. I just did a refinance of these loans with another company. I show that my mortgage has been paid off but the HELOC is still open is showing a full balance of $ XXXX. I reached out to the title company and they confirmed that they overnighted the payoff for HELOC in the amount of $ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they have a delivery signature by BofA on XX/XX/XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, but the account is still open and balance is still outstanding 7 days later. Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, i tried to reach out to BofA to resolve the situation. I spoke to a first representative who confirmed they don't show any pending payments on my account, the representative confirmed my phone number of file and noted the account and said they need to transfer me to customer service so they can check once more if there are any pending payments. I was on hold for 2 hours 45 minutes and then a second representative spoke to me. I described my concerns, the rep told me not to worry since i have a confirmation that the payment has been received and it will be applied eventually. I asked her if her response violates the RESPA payment guidelines, she placed me on hold and then disconnected the call ( since the first person i talked to confirmed my phone number of file i was hoping this representative would call me back, that didn't happen ). I am now filing the complaint with CFPB in hopes to receive the response from Bank of America about what happened to the payment they received, i would also like to confirm there will be no credit reporting impact after this is resolved."
Mortgage,"A few month ago I called You Bank of America to ask if windstorm coverage was necessary, since the loan ( {$220000.00} ) to value ratio was low ( home is appraised over {$2.00} XXXX ). The land value alone is valued at more than tree times the actual loan we hold from you. In any case, the answer I received from your office Was NO, no need for it. We changed our carrier because we found that they would included all of our needs in one policy, ( Cars, Collectibles, Umbrella, Contents, etc. ) Now after all is done, you are requiring us to get windstorm!? We even went trough a mayor Hurricane and nothing happen.. not one claim! The house was build beyond the requirements of the building codes. 

We have been for years very good customers, even through hard times! We have been paying mainly interest with very little principal ( that should be illegal ), without complaining. I have spent TWO hours, mainly on hold try to ask to speak to supervisors ; no help, the answer Ive got was to send a letter, by mail! I asked for a name and email NO there is no such thing"
Mortgage,"I continue to seek an equitable solution from my lender, BNY Mellon to resume making mortgage payments. The  California Homeowner Bill of Rights states that a homeowner has the right to know who their lender is, and be able to make contact. The recorded message at XXXX XXXX XXXX states : "" Hello, if you are calling because the owner of your loan, please listen to the following message. The servicer of your loan is required to provide you with this telephone number under new regulations. The servicer of your loan was given the authority by the owner of the loan to make all declsions concerning the terms of your loan. The servicer is the only party who can make these decisions including whether to modify your loan, and you should contact them if you have no done so already. If you are in contact with your servicer, please continue to seek guidance from them ... '' The servicer of my loan, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, continues to say that BNY Mellon makes all the decisions. In XXXX 's literature under the title of "" Need Mortgage Help, '' it states, "" Our mission is simple : We 'll do everything we can do to keep you in your home. Our philosophy is : let 's work together to find the right solution that works for you. '' Among the loss mitigation options are 1. an interest only loan with a balloon, 2. missed payments and penalties put on the back end, 3. forbearance, 4. loan modification, among other  options. A recent conversation I had with them revealed that they do not offer any of these options except for a modification or short sale. The modification available reduces the payments by a few XXXX dollars. 
Given this, I retained the services of XXXX XXXX, partner at XXXX XXXX to assist me in communicating with the owner of the loan. I will refer back to XXXX. A previous CFPB complaint I filed revealed this : "" ... .the servicer informed you that the investor of the loan ( is ) The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Alternative Loan XXXX. Please note that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the trustee, an independent party responsible for administering the trust for the benefit of investors. The trustee is the owner of the mortgage solely for the benefit of the investors, who are the true beneficial owners of the mortgage. '' The BNY has never responded to XXXX XXXX or to me. XXXX did respond to XXXX XXXX 's letter by stating that ( in effect ) the guidelines for my loan or modification thereof, are "" the guidelines set forth by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. CFPB does not determine payment programs."
Mortgage,"Today, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, one day after the auction of the unsecured debt ninety months past due related to the XXXX Deed of Trust which Bank of America has represented to me no principal balance exists, I have had to deal with a man driving a blue XXXX XXXX claiming his client bought my property and home. After he tried to open my front door without knocking, I told him to leave as he is trespassing and not to come back. I also informed him his client may have bought a debt, but he did not buy this property as this property was not used as collateral to secure the debt once incurred under the terms of the XXXX Deed of Trust and to contact Bank of America to get the details related to the XXXX Deed of Trust, California Homeowners Bills of Rights, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and Adverse Possession. 
Additionally, Bank of America has committed multiple acts of fraud related to this account, including dual tracking. But for dual tracking, I would not be subjected to the unwanted traffic upon my property and disruption of my quality of life. It is because of dual tracking, the recording of the Notice of Default, subsequent Notice of Trustee Sale and the Trusstee 's auction, I can get no rest nor peace, night or day. 
All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and required, including a brand new home built on the subject property complete with landscaping as it is no longer a place of peace, security, and tranquility."
Mortgage,I entered into a XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX with Bank of America and the forbearance concluded in XXXX of XXXX. The Forbearance agreement I entered into in XX/XX/XXXX stated that I would not be reported to the credit bureau. When the forbearance concluded I was given different options on how to pay the deferred money back. I choose to put it at the back end of the loan. The agreement stipulated again that based on XXXX  Forbearance guidelines this would not be reported to the Credit Bureau. At this time I applied for a XXXX  modification which I was told would only take 90 days but that took 6 months to complete because of unethical practices by Bank of America to try to drag the process on and ask for unreasonable financial information in order for me to stop the process. This is not new for Bank of America as they are being sued for the same practices from a XXXX lawsuit. After the 6 months I was informed that I was denied the mortification and that I could not appeal the decision. Days after the denial they reported the Forbearance balance which was put at the back end of loan to the credit bureau which violated our agreement.
Mortgage,"Purchase house in 2005, value at that time {$220000.00}, value now around {$200000.00} ; at time of purchase with Bank of America, HELOC used as part of purchase, {$46000.00}, HELOC at XXXX yrs., paid around {$24000.00} in interest/XXXX., for next XXXX yrs. to pay $ XXXX/mo., for additional {$75000.00}. Bank unable to refinance for lower and fixed interest due to value of house."
Mortgage,"5 years ago I purchased a home in XXXX Florida. Recently I decided to sell and have a buyer. During the selling process I was notified by the title company XXXX XXXX attached a lien on my house 3 months after I purchased it. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED! I have never even done business with XXXX XXXX. Now XXXX XXXX is saying it 's Bank of America fault. I have many many requests to XXXX XXXX to straighten this out. They could not even figure out why it was there. My real estate agent, title company, lawyer have not been successful in getting them to sign a release of title, even though they admit that it s what is needed. My contract expires Monday with buyer and I am going to lose my sale. I have talked to 6 representatives at XXXX XXXX, the last being XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), she will not give me her supervisors name and will no longer answer my calls. I know that XXXX XXXX has fraudulently attached to my title, and a simple release of title will fix this but now it is to late to save my sale. XXXX XXXX has caused both monetary loss and emotional stress unfairly to me. I am being penalized for BOA/XXXX  XXXX mistake. This is unheard of! This is negligence, it 's fraudulent. How could a bank, mo this after a home is purchased, accidental put their name on a title!!!????? If the CFPB is really here to help consumers, then this is a perfect case!"
Mortgage,"My Loan transferred from Countrywide to Bank of America in XXXX. I received a phone call from a person I believed to be a representative of Bank of America.  This representative ( stated name as XXXX ) stated that the loan was transferring to Bank of America, and that I needed to make my payments directly to the bank. He stated Bank of America would also be the servicer of the loan, but until that happened, he stated I would be depositing my payment at XXXX XXXX. He provided me with account number to deposit in at XXXX XXXX, and then we hung up. I started making my payments at XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I continued making my mortgage payments at XXXX until the following XX/XX/XXXX,  when I received another phone call ( from XXXX ) stating that Bank of America now was ready to process/service loans and I would now need to make the payments there. He provided me with a new account number for bank of America, and I started to make my payments at BofA from XX/XX/XXXX, until XX/XX/XXXX. During the time I was making payments at XXXX, I did think it was unusual, but I never received anything from Bank of America, either a phone call, or a letter stating their was any problem. Finally. in XXXX, Bank of America did come to me and state they would put me on an interest only payment plan for 5 years. I truly didn't understand why they wanted to do this, and I got confused when they stated I had to agree to this or risk foreclosure. They then stated "" we are trying to help you since you haven't made any payments in two years ''. I stated I had been making payments, by going to XXXX XXXX first, then bank of America second, That I was instructed to do that, and that I had receipts. They asked for those receipts, and I sent them copies. They stated those receipts have nothing to do with the loan, and stated I needed to prove those receipts were going to pay the loan. They then stated that in the mean time, I needed to immediately sign a loan modification, or I would be foreclosed on. They also stated that the two years would be added to the back end of the loan, with penalties and interest being added on, That total was XXXX. I relented and signed the loan modification, afraid I was about to lose my home. Within weeks of signing the modification, my note was sold to XXXXXXXX XXXX. Bank of America stayed as the processor for a period of time after XXXX XXXX took over my note, and I tried working with them to find out where the payments I made in XXXX went. I had no success. Then the processor change to XXXX XXXX, and again, I tried working with them, but they stated they had no paperwork from Bank of America about this issue. They stated they only had a document adding the XXXX to the principle amount. XXXXXXXX XXXX did ask for the receipts, but stated the receipts were not proof enough, and that I needed to get the information from both XXXX & Bank of America, showing who controlled the account, and were the money went or was applied. Of course, Bank of America & XXXX state they can't give me any information about the accounts I deposited the money in. I do realize looking back that fraud was likely committed against me, and how stupid I was being so trusting. I now must pay the XXXX to the bank, and deal with the humiliation of my actions. Having said that, I still hold out hope that the money has just not been applied to my mortgage, and is just sitting somewhere in an account. Here is the reason why ( though I admit, It likely was fruad ). For two years, when I thought I was legitimately making my payments, I was never contacted in any manner by Bank of America stating I was missing payments. Two full years ... nothing. Bank of America also never reported me as "" late '' to any of the credit bureaus. In addition, as far as I can tell, the property taxes were paid during the time I supposedly missed all those payments. I have never received a letter from the state of Nevada stating my taxes are delinquent. All that seems very odd. How did the taxes get paid, and why would Bank of America go two years and let me miss all those payments without ever contacting me or reporting it. Please help me in anyway find out where the money went, even if it was fraud ( and my stupidity ). As a single mother, I worked hard for that money, trying to support myself and my son. Just typing this, thinking about the fact that I now owe the bank an extra XXXX truly is making my stomach hurt. Thank You for listening. XXXX"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a HELOC with XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX is no longer exists. This HELOC was sold to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX, and it ended up with Bank of America. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of America stating that Bank of America had approved my Home Equity account for participation in a principal forgiveness program offered as a result of the Department of Justice and State Attorneys General national settlement with major mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, N.A. I was given a full forgiveness of the remaining principal of {$32000.00} on my Home Equity Line of Credit Account and was informed that I no longer owed anything to Bank of America and that all fees and interest were being waived. At this time, Bank of America should have filed a lien release with XXXX XXXX, State of Washington and they did not. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a new HELOC to do some home improvements to my home and to pay some debts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that a lien release was never filed. I have talked to numerous people at Bank of America. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that the lien release would be filed with XXXX XXXX, State of Washington by XX/XX/XXXX. It was not. I followed up with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that it would be taken care of by XX/XX/XXXX. I went on vacation on XX/XX/XXXX and did not return until XX/XX/XXXX. My new lender informed me on XX/XX/XXXX that they didn't have the lien release. On XX/XX/XXXX, I again followed up with Bank of America. They informed me that they sent a copy to my on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive it. They also told me that they would email a copy to me. They have not emailed a copy to me. I have done my own search on the XXXX XXXX website and do not see record of a lien release filing. Bank of America continues to lie to me. They should have filed this lien release on XX/XX/XXXX. Due to their negligence, my new loan has been delayed for over two months now. 

Any assistance that you can provide will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, XXXXGreetings_________________________, First and foremost we appreciate your undivided attention to our concern. We recently received notice from Bank of America denying a Loan Modification after dealing with them for years. 
Since the melt down and the Nation Wide Fraudulent Teaser Rate went up for many families including ours. After desperately seeking assistance and being proactive in resolving our matters in good faith. 
The home we are trying to get a Loan Modification was an inheritance home my husband was given by his living Parents. As we both worked for the XXXX our rules and ethics were we were to pay our creditors on time. 
However, as we were desperate for help we seek assistance from a company in XXXX XXXX whom seemed very legit however, that was n't the case and they turned out to be Fraudulent. We were Robbed as we filed a formal complaint with the State of California and there finding were that they were not a legit company and we were scammed from on or about XXXX XXXX. Not to mention we were proactive and always checking on the status of our case with Bank of America and they stated they had thousands-of-cases they inherited from Country Wide and it was going to take some time. Not knowing in the mean time we were being charged back interest from the time they took over CountryWides-cases until they work on our case. It was devastated to find out we were being charged all the back interest which was attached to the new modification loan. 
We came by some obstacles during this time when we were trying get a lower home payment because it was on or about {$1500.00} a month. Due to the Government shut down we encounter in XX/XX/XXXX. Trying again for another modification. We were both out of income and a job encountering a Hardship we informed Bank of America of our Hardship. While going through the modification it was very unforeseen when at the end of our trial payments the unforeseen came, we were stunned by there request not once did Bank of America mention we were to pay up front fees of approx. {$5000.00} to finalized the modification. We were never notified with a letter nor a pre-warning of the unforeseen upfront fees. That is when we decided to Short Sale the home because Bank of America would not work with us and we were mislead, deceived our trial payments were misapplied B of A stated our trial payments were being held on another account as they requested a large amount of money upfront we did n't have. After we explained the unforeseen Government shut down and the mortgage payment was to high it did not seem to matter to B of A wanted the upfront fees of {$5000.00} they were not willing to work or assist us. We being Government employee 's were proactive as we carried on per our rules conducts and ethics also with respect, dignity, values as we alway 's communicated with Bank of America. We have overwhelming substantiation were Bank of America lost our documents, misapplied our payment and often changed management on us were we had to resubmit our document over and over it appeared Bank of America was setting us out to fail. As they made a false statement sating we did not comply when in fact we did. Also Bank of America has stated that they can not qualify for these programs : HAMP/ HARDEST HIT FUND/ BANK OF AMERICA LOAN PROGRAM/ BANK OF AMERICA CAPITALIZATION PROGRAM/ HAM TIER 2 PROGRAM/ and BANK OF AMERICA PROPERTY AND XXXX HOME PROGRAM. Now some of these programs we never had heard of like BOFA 's own programs. This is a new complaint. 

We are devastated to hear the wrong doings and the abuse continues from Bank of America, Banks, Investors and Lenders it continues to exist. We are seeking your undivided attention to our case and mattes we have been loyal customers and we have worked very hard for what we have we do not practice not pa"
Mortgage,"I do not have enough room here so I'll keep it to the bare minimum. In XX/XX/XXXX BofA granted us a loan modification. They did not honor the new payments. According to the most recent "" reason '' they did not is they claim the payment amount was not enough to cover the escrow account. I have a letter from BofA that I received in XX/XX/XXXX showing that there is {$44000.00} ( that's XXXX ) IN THE ESCROW ACCOUNT. Right now. It seems to me that this agency, CFPD, is not for the consumer and does nothing but defer to the company there's a complaint about. I have had thousands of conversations with BofA and not one person seems to know what's happening! They rescinded the UNLAWFUL foreclosure that they did in XX/XX/XXXX due to the fact that it was "" invalid due to an agreement between the borrower and the servicer prior to the foreclosure sale. '' THEIR WORDS. They NEVER TRIED TO RECTIFY THAT MISTAKE! They have spun up whatever story they see fit as to why they can illegally foreclose. I was making the required payments under the modification agreement!!! The last administration gave Billions of dollars to the BANKS to fix the problems they caused. They have done no such thing. I have all documents to prove that I did nothing wrong!"
Mortgage,"In XXXX I contact Bank of America and asked for a deferment on my mortgage due to COVID. They said that they would do a one month deferment and I would need to call back the following month to have it extended for another month. Well, I never called them the following month but the ended up doing a 3 month deferment for the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments and my next payment would be due on XX/XX/2020. XX/XX/XXXX came by and the regular automatic payments resumed and I thought I was done with the deferment/forbearance program. Then in XXXX they didn't draft a payment, so I made one manually. That payment went to principal only and not to Principal and Interest plus my impound account. I then realized that they had stuck me on ANOTHER deferment for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and my next payment wasn't due until XX/XX/2020. So I called them and asked to to reverse that principal only payment and have it applied to my XXXX payment. Needless to say it wasn't done. So I called again and they said they can only do that if I cancel the forbearance/deferment program I am on. I told them to go ahead I made payments for the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments that were deferred. Well, they took the payments for those 3 months and applied it to Principal Only again. I called AGAIN and to have the forbearance/deferment canceled, which they finally did but they canceled it only for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. They took all the payments that they had applied to Principal and reversed them and applied them to the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments making me due for XX/XX/XXXX again. What they should have done was applied the payments to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, ( XXXX was already made ) and XXXX and had me due for XX/XX/XXXX. I called again and they said they will have my case manager call me on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX  but I never got the call. I don't know what else to do as I don't want to have my mortgage have a balance that is in deferment."
Mortgage,"During the process of obtaining a mortgage, Bank of America sent my personal information to an individual that is unknown to me. My loan processor said in an email that my closing documents, which include sensitive personal information, was sent to an individual that I do not know. I did not agree to let that individual to possess my personal information. My identity could be stolen as a result and I expect Bank of America to be able to protect and prevent that from happening. However, Bank of America was unable to do so and knowingly sent my personal information to an individual that has no prior connection to me. Once again, I did not agree to have my personal information to be sent to that particular individual. I have to emphasize that I do not know the person that my personal information was sent to. That should not have happened, and I 'm extremely frustrated and disappointed in Bank of America 's action."
Mortgage,"The XXXX determined that I was wronged by Bank of america, the settlement was that bank of america NA would submit documents too the XXXX credit bureaus to repair my credit and reduce amount owed. They were to remove all legal fee 's and other fees associated with my mortgage. They did not comply causing me serious difficulty in purchasing a vehicle and refinancing my home loan. They instead sold my loan to XXXX XXXX and pretty much left me with bad credit and a payment of XXXX per month."
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a conversion of my HELOC to a fixed rate loan due to the balloon payment coming due on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$28000.00}. It took Bank of America 8 months to process the conversion with approximately 5 different processors and multiple requests to resubmit the same documents several times as a result. In the end, it was the original processor, XXXX XXXX, who was assigned once again to my file and who finally moved us to closing in XX/XX/XXXX. In the beginning, XXXX had told me to continue making payments as I had been until we closed on the conversion/modification, which I continued to do as documented on the following statements. Bank of America is reporting my payment history during the processing time as 30, 60, 90, 120,120,120, 120, 120 during the processing time. I do understand the reason they are giving, saying the reporting is accurate because the full amount of the balance was due at the time. However, due to their failure to process the application in a timely manner is not taken into consideration and we should not be held accountable. 

Having been in banking as a XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX for more than 27 years, I know that this process should have taken 2-4 weeks at the most. Eight months is totally unacceptable and we should not be penalized for the banks delay. 

I have contacted Bank of America directly and filed disputed with all three major credit reporting agencies. Each time they reply that the reporting is accurate and no adjustment is made to my credit report."
Mortgage,"During XXXX, Bank of America charged late fees on our loan account 2-3 times ( for a total of {$890.00} ) when we were a few days past the grace period. We asked to change the due date on the loan to better match the timing our self-employed income was received during the month and the bank later complied & changed our monthly due date from the XXXX to the XXXX of the month -- at that point I asked the bank to waive the prior late charges & was told by a bank representative that I would need to show a new track record of no late payments and to make the waiver request later after a good record was established. I was not told at that time that I must make the request within 12 months of any charged fee. I did not make a request during XXXX because of covid distractions & assumed a longer track record would help the request when made. This year XXXX I have made the request several times to the bank -- we have not had a late payment since the due date change -- but the bank reps now repeatedly tell me the policy is : such fees can not be waived unless the request is made within 12 months and they will not waive the fees. We have been banking customers at Bank of America for over 26 years and we are frustrated that the policy was not disclosed to us in XXXX ( if it was in effect then )."
Mortgage,"My mortgage loan is through Bank of America. I have 11 months until it is paid in full. I received a letter from BofA today, indicating "" Reply required, '' asking for date of birth, occupation, and source of income. This information was provided at the time of mortgage application. Hence, I suspected this request to be a scam or fraud. If not, it appears that BofA is not a good custodian of my personal information. The letter states : "" Please note : Not providing the required information by the date listed above may be considered a request from you to close your account ( s ). '' I did not appreciate this threat, and quite frankly did not understand what it meant ... to close my mortgage? This is not an open line of credit. It is not clear, did they intend to call the balance due and send me to Collections? For information provided 14 years ago that they did not retain? I called BofA to ask specifically what they intended to do, to close my mortgage. The rep said they would n't be closing it, but I would not be eligible to apply for future loans through Bank of America. I would interpret this to be discouragement, a violation of ECOA, Federal regulation B.
This is troublesome behavior from one of the nation 's largest lenders."
Mortgage,"Bank of America started servicing my Mortgage in XXXX. I had a conventional loan. I received a permanent home modification in XXXX. My loan has always been in good standing and was never deliquent. I modified the loan to get a lower interest rate. Apparently Bank of America made some mistakes during this process of the modification and I had to do the Modification over again. In XXXX Bank of Americaa sold my loan to a Dept Collection Agency named XXXX. This company has unscrupolus business practices that has caused emotional and financial harm to me. In XXXX, XXXX, I began to make my contractual mortgage payments to XXXX as my new servicer in the amount of {$620.00}. XXXX immediately claimed I missed a payment to Bank of Americia on XXXX XXXX and begin to harrass me on my cell phone demanding that I pay them. I told them I had never missed a payment with Bank of America and why would they concern themselfs with my Morgage with Bank of America 2 year prior to them taking over my loan? XXXX claimed they paid Bank of America the missing funds on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and begin to charge me late fees and evenutlly cause my loan to go into Foreclosure. XXXX also increased my Mortgage amount from {$620.00} to {$790.00} stating I had a shortage in Escorws without properly notifying me of the large increase. When I paid the amount I was contracted to pay, XXXX put my mortgage payment in a suspense account stating they do not take partial payments. XXXX begain to add late fees, unauthorized inspection fees and demanded full payment and threatend to start legal procedures of foreclosure. I contacted XXXX representatives in XXXX week trying to resolve this proplem. XXXX did XXXX escrow analysis from XXXX XXXX to XXXX, XXXX and each time my escow shortage changed with each representative. I contacted Bank of America and aske them if they have any knowledge of a missed payment and they said no. I asked Bank of America to fax over my payment history which they did and there was no record of a missed payment. XXXX continued to harrass me as a collection agency does. I was confused about how my mortgage having been serviced by a professional and reputable company such as Bank of America could go from excellent payment history to Foreclosure in a matter of 4 months. I was so distraught I reached out to my brother for support that perhaps I was somehow making a mistake. He looked at my banking records from XXXX XXXX Bank and Bank of America 's record and he too found no missing payments and he wrote the CEO of the Company and filed a complaint that XXXX was falsesifying records to delibertly cause my loan to be in default, however, XXXX 's investigation found no errors and reported my loan deliquent to the credit bureau and I was disqulified from receiving my {$5000.00} inscentive payment for keeping my loan in good standing. After much grief dealing with a Criminal company, I reached out to the XXXX office to file a complaint against XXXX and discovered XXXX is not a bank at all they are a fly by night collection company. Bank of America has no documentation of XXXX ever sending them funds on XXXX XXXX and there is no missing payment. XXXX is running scams on their customers and there is plenty documentatiion as such. My loan should have never went to a collection agency and XXXX uses off shore agents to handle mortgages and unauthorized escrow agents who are not trained and who has made many mistakes on my account. In XXXX, XXXX blessed me to receive the hardest hit fund in the amount of {$20000.00} to be applied to the principal balance but Nationstar didnt apply the funds until XXXX, XXXX. I had made several extra payments to my principal balance but XXXX refused to apply these funds as I alocated .Why was my loan turned over to collection"
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2018, I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and my husband, XXXX XXXX, filed for bunkruptcy of some credit card debt incurred through XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX business. 

That bankruptcy never included the 1st & 2nd mortgages held by myself and a third party, XXXX XXXX These mortgages are for the primary residence of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, & XXXX XXXX. 

In XX/XX/2018, Bank of America ( holder of the 1st mortgage ) notified us that they sold that mortgage to XXXX XXXX. We were paid up and current with BofA, and going forward from XX/XX/2018 our payment were to be made to XXXX XXXX. 

We did all that. Now BofA is insisting on a duplicate payment back to them that we were never notified about and BofA has attached themselves to our bankruptcy after-the-fact, and after the terms of our bankrupcy had already been negotiated and signed on."

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of America with a modification approval attached to it. At the beginning of the pandemic, I had 15 or so years remaining before I owned my house. I currently owe {$110000.00}. My payments is {$950.00} per month. Bank of America is ripping people off. My new offer is {$570.00} for 480 month.They did not offer an interest rate change. Their offer extends my years which makes me more economically challenged, and prevents me from building wealth. How is this okay? They received a bailout in XXXX and I'm sure that they've received assistance from CARES and ARPA, so they know what "" help '' looks like. They should not be considered to big to fail when they are failing everyday people. This is unacceptable."
Mortgage,"I 've been living in my home with my wife and XXXX children since XXXX of 2010. Everything was going well as planned until we ran into some financial issues. Our current mortgage is thru Bank of America and after falling behind a few months on my payments, I reached out for assistance. At first they tried to give me a 3 month forbearance, but after completing all paperwork required, and XXXX payment submitted, they decided to return my check and tell me that I did n't sign the last XXXX sheet in time, so I 'm no longer approved. Since then I 've been in touch with a representative who was trying to work with me on submitting more paperwork to be reviewed for help, but they came back again and tried to say I made a few XXXX more than I did. I was advised to resubmit the paperwork again with the figures that were exact ; I was told that if I do n't get approved then my only choice will be a short sale or foreclosure. I ve repeatedly expressed that I 'm willing to do anything and make payments but they do n't seem to care. I thought they 'd want to help someone willing to make payments but they 'd rather try and foreclosure or make me do a short sale. I do n't know where to go from here if I can not get assistance"
Mortgage,"In XXXX of 2010 my wife and I had an appointment with Bank Of America to work out a acceptable mortgage plan to make our mortgage more affordable. I was working on XXXX that day.

They, Bank of America, flat out refused to rescheduale the meeting. Since that day we were treated like criminals. Now we have had to short sale out home, can not find a place to live. We have two months before we have to move out. Bank of America sold our mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. XXXX XXXX XXXX started off treating us the same way as Bank Of America, probably to do notes By XXXX XXXX from the XXXX. XXXX. office.We had our rights violated by not getting another meeting to work out the financial issues. Because of this we were not able to qualify for a loan modification."
Mortgage,"We are currently trying to refinance our mortgages. We just found out that Bank of America shows that our acct is charged off ( Acct # XXXX ) We had fell behind, a while ago, but set up payment arrangements with them, and the ACH our payments out each month. We have never received any info on a "" charge off '' and currently paying them each month. We also show them still on our title, and they have a lien on our property still."
Mortgage,"I applied for assistance in saving my home with my lender, Bank of America, on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I hired an attorney to help me submit my paperwork to my lender Bank of America. My attorney confirmed Bank of America received my full and complete application and all financials. Bank of America then recorded a Notice of Sale against me on XXXX/XXXX/2015 with a sale date set for XXXX/XXXX/2015. I am told per RESPA - Mortgage Servicing Regulation X XXXX, my servicer is not supposed to move forward with foreclosure ( XXXX ) if I have an application submitted XXXX days prior to any sale date. My application was submitted 41 days prior to any sale date. I feel my servicer, Bank of America, illegally recorded a notice of sale against me and is therefore now "" Dual Tracking '' my foreclosure process. I am currently under review for a loan modification. I feel I qualify for assistance. My attorney says I qualify for assistance. Bank of America 's actions appear to violate RESP Reg x ( 1024.41 )."
Mortgage,"I received notice from Bank of America that my mortgage was being sold effect XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This is less than 15 days as required by 12 CFR 1024.33. 
I contacted BoA and told them they did not provide enough notice per the law, I was informed the letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX and that was more than 15 days.

Mortgage,"Im writing this letter in hope you could intervene and get Bank of America to properly review our loan for assistance options. The issue started at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, when our grandson was diagnosed with XXXX. My wife left her steady job and started her own business so she would have time to care for him. It hurt our finances but we made it work. 

Then in XX/XX/XXXX, my pay was reduced at work. Up until that point, I had a dependable salary, and we paid our mortgage on time. With this next blow, we did what we could to keep ourselves afloat. 

When I first contacted Bank of America, things seemed like they would be ok. But a repayment plan outside of our means to pay was not the life line we needed. At that point, representatives stopped taking my calls. No one at the bank would speak to me. When I finally received correspondence, I was shocked to learn that I am now in danger of losing my home. 

We are starting to get back on our feet again. Im back to a normal schedule at work. My wife returned to her job. The last step is to get our mortgage back in good standing, which I have been trying and would like to do. I need a reasonable, affordable payment plan. Bank of America refuses to help."
Mortgage,"My loan with Bank of American was in forbearance due to Covid. I didn't pay 4 months due to my loss of income during covid. I resumed paying the monthly dues after 4 mos but the 4 months behind I wasn't able to pay. BofA charged me fees ( miscellaneous ) for a total of {$560.00}. When I called them what those charges are for they told me it's for "" they pay somebody every month to come & pass by the house to check if I'm living in the house ''. This was just so ridiculous. I can't believe. I asked their Customer Service if they do that to everybody who are in forbearance, she said "" yes ''. My heloc is XXXX XXXXXXXX. The value of the property is {$1.00} XXXX. I live in XXXX XXXX XXXX. After forbearance period in XXXX I called them & asked if they can do something for me ( as what their website says ) for the forbearance amount like put back at the end of the loan or loan modification. They told me my loan was not set up that way!!! I didn't have any choice but to pay off the forbearance amount. 
Is it ethical to charge their customer this kind of fees during hardship?

Mortgage,"In XXXX of 2020 I called Bank of America to discuss the mortgage deferment program due to Covid-19. I was told that I was allowed to skip 3 payments and it would be added to the back of my loan. To the best of my knowledge I skipped my XXXX, XXXX & XXXX payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called up bank of America to let them know that I wanted to exit the program and continue regular scheduled payments. For some reason they collected half a payment from me on XX/XX/XXXX, then they collected the other half of the payment on XX/XX/XXXX and advised me that was for my XX/XX/XXXX payment. Then on XX/XX/XXXX another payment was made and I was advised this was for my XX/XX/XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX another full payment was made, according to my math three full payments were made after I requested to end the forbearance period. I am currently trying to refinance with another lender and they are telling me according to my Bank of America current mortgage statement that it is showing that I have not made a payment since XX/XX/XXXX, which is clearly untrue based on the above events. Also, my current mortgage statement shows that I owe over {$14000.00} to Bank of America to come current with my payments.

Mortgage,I need mortgage verification letter from Bank of America for a HELOC. My husband and I called on 3 separate occasions and was on hold for 1-2 hours at a time.

On both occasions we got there and they called the mortgage department they said the couldnt send it to the branch. We were also told they could fax it but couldnt email it but that also never happened. Thus has been a nightmare! I will be cancelling my accounts.

The underwriter intentionally delayed the process by requesting documents one by one every 3-5 days. That caused the the point fee for 3.875 % increased from {$4200.00} to {$6100.00} because of the 2 months delay caused by the underwriter.

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2019 I requested and applied for a pre qualification for a mortgage for a second home from Bank of America. The agent XXXX   XXXX  out of XXXX, NC sent me the electronic application, which I completed and she called me a XXXX. She stated that in order to qualify for a 10% down payment I would need to have a 740+ credit score. My 3 scores at that time were XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX. My BOA app states an XXXX   score. She stated she would call me on Friday XX/XX/19. I heard nothing until late on Monday, when I was informed that I did not qualify for 10% down because my score was less than 740. I have since had multiple phone calls and emails with the representative, who stated she would call me on a conference call with her supervisor on XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19 I sent copies of all 3 of my credit reports to the representative. I pulled them myself to avoid additional inquiries on my report. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating the she was sick and would not be able to call me. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent an email to the representative stating that I was still waiting. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that her manager had requested that she send him ""an additional piece of info from the company they order reports from"" I have had no contact or response since then.I fear that if I allow them to re pull my report, they will pull the correct scores and attribute this to a computer malfunction. I do not have the pre qualification to date, and I have no answer as to how their system pulled an erroneous score. On this loan alone, BOA would stand to make considerable amounts more by charging an interest rate based on a lower than actual score. Please assist in making sure that this is not intentionally being done by BOA to increase revenues. Thank you for your assistance and consumer protection.

Mortgage,"In XXXX 2015, we contacted Bank of America ( BoA ) regarding pre-qualifying for a mortgage on a second home in California. On XXXX XXXX we received a letter of pre-approval indicating an interest rate of XXXX. We found a house we wanted to make an offer on. We soon learned that California is a very competitive seller 's market and our contract had no financing contingency and very short time frames for appraisal and inspection, and closing. Our offer, while not the highest, was accepted because we did not require immediate occupancy. The Owner had given tenant verbal, but not written notice and he was entitled to sixty days. This situation was explained to our loan officer and the final contract written "" tenant to remain in possession ''. 
Throughout the loan process, BoA failed to follow their stated guidelines for prompt response. This was very frustrating to us due to the short deadlines imposed by our sales contract. On XXXX I advised my loan officer of my dissatisfaction and asked for assurance that the closing date promised was still good. During the week of XXXX the escrow company also tried unsuccessfully to reach our loan officer. I finally received an email on XXXX that our loan officer was "" looking into '' what was taking so long in underwriting. On XXXX FOR THE FIRST TIME, BoA raised the issue of the tenant. I immediately responded that this had been explained from the onset, that the tenant would be given 60 day notice immediately, and asked why this was being raised just before closing when BoA had been in possession of the Final Counter Offer for almost 30 days. I also asked for an IMMEDIATE response on the interest rate as BoA intimated that this could affect the rate. 
I received no response until the Friday before closing was to occur, when a new "" manager '' contacted us. We were asked to furnish additional documents, which we did ; I asked why these documents were being requested on the last business day before closing and why the tenant issue was raised for the first time just before closing. The manager acknowledged that these issues should have been handled earlier and implied the loan had been mishandled. When I again asked for a response to my question about the interest rate, I was told FOR THE FIRST TIME it would be XXXX based on a rental not XXXX as a second home. I then told him that the definition of XXXX home required intent to occupy as a residence and occupancy within sixty days. This is the legal definition of occupancy used by the Federal government/ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX He then said that because of all the problems he would reduce the rate to XXXX. I told him that was UNACCEPTABLE ; and to go back to underwriting and determine if a copy of the 60 day vacancy notice to the tenant would satisfy them. We thought the issue was resolved when XXXX XXXX called back and said that an addendum to the sale contract stating that tenant would vacate in 60 days of closing would suffice. A short time later, XXXX XXXX called back and told us that underwriting had changed its mind and required immediate occupancy upon closing. This all occurred after business hours on the Friday before we were to close! At this point, we were convinced BoA was doing a last minute "" bait and switch '' and had dragged this out intentionally in order to force us into a loan at a higher rate."
Mortgage,"Bank of America Home Loan 's fraud into my account continues. Today this outstanding balance on my account has jumped to {$310000.00} with a interest payment due of {$3300.00}. It's illegal and criminal. Bank need to STOP all these illegal activities into my HELOC account # XXXX now, come clean, reinstate all correct entries, stop harassing me and above all explain and apologize."
Mortgage,"I have a mortgage loan from Bank of America ( Account # XXXX ). In XX/XX/2021, I received a notice from my homeowner 's insurance company XXXX, XXXX for renewal of homeowner 's insurance. I did not want to renew it with XXXX, because they wanted to charge me a significant higher premium. I informed Bank of America on XX/XX/2021. Bank of America asked me to upload new insurance information on XXXX/bankofamerica. I uploaded new insurance information on XX/XX/2021 and received a message that Bank of America has received my new insurance policy. Nothing was updated on my loan. I sent them this information at least five time. I faxed them this information. I mailed them this information. I received a message that my insurance with a new company has been noted on my loan and my previous insurance company will not be paid. A couple of weeks later, I received a message from Bank of America that they have paid premium to my previous insurance company also and now I am responsible to recover that money from my previous insurance company. I contacted my previous insurance company. They issued me a check and I sent that check to Bank of American as per their instructions. I kept checking with Bank of America about the status of check sent to them. Now they tell me that they did not receive the check and I need to stop payment and get a new check from previous insurance company. I am being harassed by this bank for their inefficiency. I am 60 years told and I am being asked to fix problems caused by this bank. A similar problem had occurred last year also. I would appreciate if CFPB can intervene on my behalf and ask this bank to fix their problems instead of harassing me."
Mortgage,"We contacted Bank of America for refinance of our current mortgage. In order to do so we were required to pay upfront fees for an appraisal and credit check. We did this. We were never told or notified that we would only have a short period of time to submit documents or the application would be closed and the fee forfeited. At this same time, other circumstances that life threw at us did not allow us to be able to submit the documentation needed in a period of time they requested us to do AFTER the upfront fees were collected by them. Still, at this time, nothing about waiving the upfront fees if documents were not returned was stated either verbally or in writing. As soon as able, we tried to submit the documents via their website. It indicated to us that the application was closed. We called the mortgage broker, XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) who indicated that we would have to start the application process over again and in order to do so, we would need to pay an additional upfront fee to cover the appraisal and credit check. I would assume that the credit check and credit rating within a week or so would and should still be on record at that institution and would and should be used. I do not want more credit checks completed which can have a negative impact on our credit rating. ALSO, the appraiser had been to our home 2 days prior to trying to submit the documents and the subsequent conversation via phone with XXXX XXXX. He indicated that he was not sure why the appraiser was there when the application was closed, but it must have been in in the process of letting the appraiser know. I indicated that since we paid for the appraisal, we would like to get a copy of the appraisal. He indicated that he could not do that, but if we paid ANOTHER up front fee and initiated the application process again, the previous one could be reimbursed to us at the end of the process. I indicated that I needed to speak to his supervisor. He indicated that I could have his voicemail. I indicated that I would hold to speak to his boss that he had just indicated he had talked to to make sure he could offer to reimburse our first set of fees IF we would reapply and pay the 2nd set of fees. FINALLY, I was able to talk to XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) who further indicated that he could not help us unless we would pay the second set of fees. I indicated that the fees we had already paid should have gotten us an appraisal and a credit report for the bank to use. I questioned why we would need to pay that again within less than a month of the previous fee collection. He stated that the "" system '' would not allow them to start an appraisal without collecting the fee again. I indicated then that I would rather just have the copy of the appraisal that I had already paid for and go elsewhere. He indicated that the appraisal was in the name of Bank of America and not us. I then asked for the name of the appraiser to which he responded that he could not have the name of the appraiser because the bank, legally, can not talk to the appraiser. This perplexed me. The appraisal that I paid for, was in the bank 's name, but the bank can not talk to the appraiser because it is illegal for them to. This seems like a huge conflict to me. SO, XXXX XXXX indicated to me that the only way for me to get anything out of the {$500.00} that we had to pay less than a month before for an appraisal from which an appraiser came to my home 2 days prior to the conversation, was to reapply and pay the fee again ... As you can see on the documents attached, the bank never indicated that the fee would be forfeited if the documents were not received within any length of time. The paperwork only indicated that the interest rate was locked in until XXXX XXXX ... If that is the case there is no reason the application would need to be closed."
Mortgage,I have continuously submitted copies of consecutive documents to the lender but they keep on asking me for the same information over and over again. I have clarified everything in question and just feel like they are giving me the round around. They told me that I am getting removed soon because I have not provided the documents that they are asking for but I have and its not going anywhere.

Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/11 I called and informed my bank that I may not be able to pay my mortgage this month or the next. Now mind you, I was current at that time. I got in contact with mortgage retention Relationship Banker, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX was very understanding and helpful. XXXX XXXX went over a few options ; she asked me if I wanted to keep the property because there is an option called a Forbearance that would fit for what I wanted to do and the period was for ( 90 ) days. XXXX XXXX said that she would put the paperwork together and get it to me ; she also mentioned that it would take approximately ( 10 ) ten days to do so. I thanked XXXX XXXX and awaited the paperworkOn XXXX/XXXX/11 I called XXXX XXXX and informed her that I had not gotten any paperwork, she apologized graciously and mentioned that she could do it over the phone if I had about ( XXXX ) fifteen or XXXX minuets, I agreed. She asked me about my entire income and expenses for my household, etc. After all was said, entered and done, she gave me my forbearance end date, '' XXXX XXXX, 2011. '' I was happy and all was well. 
Until XXXX/XXXX/11, I called XXXX XXXX to inform her that I had gotten a notice stating the intent to accelerate foreclosure was started. '' Now mind you '', I am now ( 2 ) months behind, I was assured and given by a bank official 's word and end date that I was in forbearance, Definition of Temporary Forebearance Agreement = An agreement whereby we agree not to proceed with foreclosure and/or collecting of payments for a period of time to allow to re-establish your ability to make the required payments. 
I called feverously to get in contact with XXXX XXXX to find out what was going on. 
On XXXX/XXXX/11 I got through to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I proceeded to explain the situation and the promise I was given by the Relationship Banker XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX told me that the previous Relationship Banker should not have told me that, and what she told me was erroneous. 

I informed XXXX XXXX that XXXX XXXX had taken the information over the phone, typed it in to expedite it ... XXXX XXXX asked if she could look in to the situation to see if there is some thing she is over looking and get back with meI called and was not able to get in contact with anyone at all for days, even though their voice mail states that they will return your call in 24 hours and you can call their manager. When I call their manager I will get the same message. Finally I get in contact with XXXX XXXX, an she wanted to redo the forbearance package and that 's when I had a bad feeling of what the outcome was going to be. 

I knew when she does this again, it was not going to be approved for some none commonsense reason. I reluctantly agreed because I wanted to trust my bank again and the hopes that she does n't lie to me or tell me erroneous information. 

The packet was redone, and it 's close to XX/XX/XXXX, "" Mind you I 'm 3 months behind now '' Originally I was granted 90 day forbearance which is due on XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, while the packet was being looked over again I took matters into my own hands and did the following below. 
On XXXX/XXXX/11 I went to the branch to pay for the past three months "" plus late fees of course '', and end all of this, but to my surprise the bank would not take the money! I had the entire amount in full before the forbearance original end date, Also well within the window before foreclosure proceedings should start. They instructed me to call the mortgage department. I had the branch get in touch with the mortgage department and the person I spoke with told me that they would have someone to call me. 
XXXX XXXX got back with me and said that she could not grant me 90 day forbearance because of the following reason, My unemployment was not not considerenot considered income."
Mortgage,"Could n't be more disappointed and angered by Bank of America 's home loan department, specifically XXXX, XXXX ID : XXXX, and his manager XXXX XXXX, XXXX ID : XXXX, at the XXXX location in XXXX. We 've been a Bank of America preferred customer for decades and have excellent credit. We met with XXXX in XX/XX/2016 for a very low risk, low loan to value refinance on our vacation home in Delaware. We explained to XXXX that we rented our home in the summer and spent time there in the off season. We also said we were shopping rates, as low rates were plentiful at the time. He offered us a lock on a 2.75 % interest rate with credit toward closing costs in order to keep our business. We agreed and provided all the required documents. 
Months passed, the general election happened, and the financial environment turned as rates climbed higher. We were relieved that we had a lock but concerned that a simple refinance was taking so long, so we followed up several times with no response. Finally we received a return call in XX/XX/XXXX with news that the bank had a "" counteroffer '' for us. It was XXXX bps higher with thousands in additional closing costs. When we said no, there must be a mistake, we have a lock offer, we were told the bank 's guidelines classified our home as an investment property not as a second home, and so they rated it higher. 
Had we been told this in XX/XX/XXXX, when rates were low and lenders were hungry, we would 've gone to another lender we had identified whose guidelines accepted our property as a second home. We did not make that choice at the time because we felt there was value in remaining a preferred customer at Bank of America. 
Our attempts to discuss this with XXXX were met with arrogance and denial. XXXX ' manager, listened with false sympathy, promised to review our case, consider the idea of credit by discount loan points, and get back to us. Again time passed, and when we finally got a response, we were basically told to pound sand and if we wanted to accept their higher offer, it would now cost us even more because of the time that had passed while we were waiting for XXXX promised call. 
Such disregard and disrespect for customers is causing us to move all of our accounts out of Bank of America and encouraging others to do the same."

All the numbers we discussed were based of a LTV of 80 %. Loan officer also stated that a drive by appraisal would take place and if I disagreed with the value i could request a full appraisal. Two days after application and running my credit I was denied for the loan due to in adequate equity. When speaking to a client rep on why denied i was informed all their HELOC products require 75 % LTV. At this time i was also told a drive by appraisal was never done and I could not request a full appraisal that they would only be using their comps. If I knew up front the LTV requirement was 75 % I would have never applied due to knowing I would not be able to obtain the amount of funds I needed. I have asked the Bank of America to remove the credit inquire and was told they would. Still to this point I have received no communication this has occurred.

Mortgage,"A recent complaint to the Federal Reserve found itself here. This was by forwarding the complaint in my name to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

Submitted to the CFPB on XX/XX/2021 XXXX The company has responded to my issue and called my phone number with verbal requests. 
My complaint is that the women servicing the complaint for Bank of America is not answering her voicemail. I called her right back after her first and only message to me. I have left messages for her everyday for weeks. She is not responding and I am concerned that Bank of America is ignoring my claims that it has attempted to sell assets such as repairable homes to single home investors for cash only. 

I am a first-time buyer looking for a home. I am currently living in a temporary housing area. It is not fair that the Realtor would not accept an offer by me or office. They were legally bound to place the home on the NJ MLS and advertised the property as not allowing offers. 

The Realtor told me that BoA has a private portfolio of homes it owns under BANA. He has ignored my legal right to purchase the home with government financing and blames the Bank of America owner for his discrimination. 

This second complaint is for XXXX found at phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX Ext. XXXX. Please have someone with means contact this girl as, she is ignoring the bureau!"
Mortgage,"To Whom it May Concern : I am a California resident and applying for a mortgage with Bank of America. However, I have not been allowed to redact part of my bank account numbers on my statements just to reflect at least the last 4 digits or more. I am concerned about the potential for fraud and privacy concerns.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this information will be used, sold or disclosed to third parties for marketing or other purposes.

As background, I am in the middle of applying for a loan. The bank has requested historical statements to show funds available. I had previously uploaded the statements redacting the account number except for the last four digits. They rejected it as unacceptable because it causes the statement to become unauthentic. 

Additionally, for at least one account, my bank showed it as combined with other accounts not listed or offered as assets to be verified on the loan application. I only have historial statements that have combined information with other accounts. My bank is unable to segregate the accounts out on a historical basis and provide statements on just that single account. ( I have notified them of this problem and going forward they have indicated separate statements will be provided just not historically ). As such, I redacted the other bank account numbers not listed on the loan application, and thus not used as assets for the purpose of obtaining the loan and uploaded those documents. Again, the documents were rejected by the bank as unauthentic and that the lender needed to see all accounts even the irrelevant ones not listed on the application. 

The banks agents indicated that the banks policy is to only accept documents with the full account number and unredacted. Any other form would be not considered authentic or altered. However, the selling guide at XXXX XXXX indicates that bank statements with at least the last 4 digits is acceptable. See link below. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Furthermore, the redacted accounted number would not interfere with the underwriters ability to verify the beginning bank balance, ending bank balance or intervening bank transactions. Thus, the redaction would not hinder the underwriting and verification of information or authenticity of the documents for lending purposes. 

Lastly, the courts have also accepted redacted statements and recognized that redaction does not impair the authenticity of that document. 

Even lawyers redact documents for privilege and recognize that redaction does not impair the authenticity of the document. 

The redaction, however, would preserve the privacy of the consumer, prevent fraud and prevent the disclosure of such information further down in the lending, sharing or marketing process. This is especially critical given that the consumers name, DOB, SSN and other sensitive PII are included in those same documents and in the wake of cybersecurity attacks. 

I am frustrated by this process because it forces me to unreasonably give up the right to my financial privacy to information that is not fully needed ( ie. full account number is not needed only partial is necessary ) and to information that is not relevant ( ie. accounts not listed on my loan application ) when a compromise ( such as partial redaction of account number or full redaction of the accounts not listed on the loan app ) could be had and is fully acceptable even by other institutions such as XXXX XXXX. 

You also do not disclose upfront to potential applicants that a verification of deposit is another acceptable form of documentation even under your own policy. I wish you had told me upfront rather than after several pushbacks on the issue. Thus, query whether the redacted account number is an acceptable alternative but simply not disclosed as an option or not evenly applied to all customers.

Even under Reg E, the Fed has recognized the significant risk that the full account number on ATM receipts pose and has required it to be truncated to just the last 4 digits. Why is a bank statement that is required to be provided to another party for a consumer product any different?

Redaction of the account number except for the last four digits is such an easy fix and would further reduce the risk of identity theft and consumer fraud committed against the consumer, as well as any sale or disclosure of such information by banks to third parties.

From a consumer perspective, I do not know if there are any CFPB or other federal regulations currently in place that address this particular issue and the significant risk in the mortgage process that would protect consumers from being forced to give up full account numbers without being able to at least redact the account number to reflect at least the last 4 digits.

If there are such regulations in place, I ask that you please disclose this or at least give me the option to redact my account number to just the last 4 digits as well as fully redact account numbers that are not offered as assets to be verified as part of this loan application listed on combined bank statements."
Mortgage,"Good Day, I am hoping someone may be able to help me with this file I am working with XXXX XXXX in the XXXX w BOA ... she has been great to work with but I think we have run into an issue with the value and the new investor that has taken over as of approx. XXXX XXXX 2016. 
I had been countered at XXXX back on XXXX XXXX ... .I received an email XXXX XXXX there was a new counter per the new investor and they were looking for an additional XXXX dollars from the buyer and or agents. 

There is an appraisal performed from BOA and or the investor and this came in at XXXX in XXXX 2016. I also have a copy of this appraisal and a valuation letter from BOA that was used for the counter the buyer accepted. I feel the investor is taking advantage of a situation were there is no value and this was confirmed by both the BOA Appraisal and the buyers lender. I have explained to the bank if the investor is looking for a higher net or value the house needs to be rehabbed as houses selling for more money are rehabbed and in better condition. The buyers are first time buyers, they are a young couple w a small child and they made a fair and honest offer based on XXXX. They did make an attempt to locate funds from family but were advised it is not smart to overpay for something were the value is not there ... they would need to increase their offer from XXXX to $ XXXX and this is with slim closing costs the bank is paying. The loan is done and all they need is an approval and we can go to docs.. 
The agent is very upset as we had been given a counter based the valuation performed and we also have an appraisal also at XXXX from the buyers lender. 
My concern is any other buyer coming in will also run into the same issue and the value and or appraisal will be an issue. 
I am hoping you can help me..Thank you XXXX Attachments"

Mortgage,"I was told that house was already sold and no one had contacted them. Then a few weeks later, told house not sold for foreclosure and new date is XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for a refund of the {$900.00}, emergency payment to stop foreclosure and told no refunds and still many other options. The man that asked for the {$900.00} phone payment, XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX, did so on a Friday and on the following Tuesday I was told house was sold, by Real Estate Agents. Tried to reach him in office but was out of office until the following Friday. Asked for refund and told no refunds allowed. Made several calls and spoke to ladies in office, but never heard from him again. Loan is with Bank of America, a Home Equity Loan, and in my husband 's name only. He passed away in XX/XX/XXXX, and Bank of America was given a death certificate. After that date, I was not allowed to receive any information regarding the loan and told my job was only to pay the monthly statements. I did until XX/XX/XXXX, and became behind on payments. Spoke to an attorney that referred me to Senator XXXX XXXX Office and XXXX XXXX, has been assisting me to get help with information regarding this loan. He put me in contact with XXXX XXXX, Resolutions Specialist. Had a couple of phone contacts, then a taped phone interview. Told me he would send me five documents I asked for a something in writing on Bank of America Letterhead, that he did a loan search and found that no other names had ever been on this loan and that a Power of Attorney, was not involved in the loan history. I did not receive the documents or letter from him, regarding our conversation on the taped phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. I waited ten days and then went to my local Bank of American Bank and they got the information I needed to contact the Loan Retention Department. Got XXXX XXXX and she got busy explaining how things worked and that I needed to be a Successor to receive information. She checked XXXX XXXX 's nots on loan history file and saw that he approved the "" Successor '' status for me to get information on XX/XX/XXXX. I told her it has been two weeks and no paperwork. She got busy and sent me the original paperwork, with my husband 's name on it, the loan settlement statement the loan history and the load pay off date and amount. The loan line of credit, approximately {$50000.00}, with transaction information, did not show up with the other four documents I am still in the process of trying to get a copy of those documents, with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, have not responded and have concerns about the final date to pay off my husband 's loan being XX/XX/XXXX, without the complete paperwork and the time to seek legal and financial advice, regarding it's status and how it is going to impact whether or not I will be able to sell house and pay off both loans on the house and unsecured credit, as planned. Getting threating telephone calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a company I am not familiar with. The most recent caller has been a man named XXXX XXXX, but several other men and women calling my unlisted number and no idea who they are. The calls tell me to call the number XXXX, or I will have a lot of unpleasant legal things happen to me. Must call immediately and they all ended with sarcastic wishes for Good Luck. The only banks I am dealing with are Bank of America, for the Home Equity Loan in my husband 's name and XXXX / XXXX XXXX, represented by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been told by Mr. XXXX in Congresswoman 's Office, working on this, that I have been given until end of XX/XX/XXXX to deal with Original Mortgage in my name. XXXX XXXX XXXX 's office phone number is XXXX and her fax # is XXXX. They have copies of the transactions between both XXXX XXXX XXXX and Bank of America, and been in contact with them since XX/XX/XXXX. When I could not get paperwork from bank of America, a local attorney, suggested I contact them and ask for their help. They have been wonderful in navigating this difficult situation. During this entire process a great deal of confusion as to who was foreclosing. The company that handles the paperwork in our area, XXXX XXXX, did not list the name of the bank and not until three days before the first foreclosure date was scheduled, we were all under the impression that the foreclosure was for the home mortgage and that XXXX was foreclosing. Asked Bank of America to have their name listed on the paperwork sent out. There was one notice that listed the name of a XXXX / XXXX employee and that lead us all to believe it was the mortgage company as we all have been working with them. It turned out to be Bank of America and since we had not heard form them in months, had no idea. Did get updated, XXXX XXXX document with Bank of America on the paperwork. The attorney 's that are representing Bank of America on the foreclosure are XXXX XXXX, at XXXX. Don't know if they can be helpful or not."
Mortgage,"I am writing to you because I am literally at my wits end. Im at a complete loss and I hope you can get accomplished at what Ive been unsuccessful at. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I walked into a local Bank of America branch to pay my mortgage. What I didnt know until Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX is that on XX/XX/XXXX the teller applied my mortgage payment to my Bank of America credit card XXXX I was scheduling my monthly bills this day when I was scheduling the BOA credit card it said I owed {$0.00} with a credit of {$570.00}. I was like do I have a secret Santa? Nope I saw payment made XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of my mortgage. I went down to the local branch with my receipts from XXXX which showed it was applied to the credit card. 

The gentleman took copies and said they couldnt fix it there and couldnt reach out to whoever until Monday XX/XX/XXXX. He took my info I got a direct number to that location went home. The guy from the bank called me said they could get ahold of someone but I needed to come back to authorize the fixing of the mistake. I went down they got a guy named XXXX on the phone he said he put in the change itll be reflected by Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX it has not been fixed Ive been to the local branch multiple times, Ive called the XXXX # and sent them messages. I have now been reported to XXXX twice for 2 months of late payments as my XXXX payment they took out of my bank account but have not applied it to my mortgage. 

This has been the worst experience ever, how difficult is it to remove the wrongly applied mortgage payment from the credit card and rightly apply it to the mortgage? Ive opened up a dispute with XXXX and then tonight I get another notification BOA has flagged me 2 months late Ive never been late ever in the 12 years Ive had a mortgage with BOA. It should not take this long to fix a mistake made by BOA and in the process my credit is taking a hit which I pride myself on good credit. 

Ive called, messaged and gone to the local branch not resolved. The customer service is awful right up there with XXXX. One response I got was were not responding to this your other message isnt closed, meanwhile theyre sending me stuff for having trouble paying my mortgage. 

I was charged at late fee etc. I just cant with this bank I honestly dont know if you can even help but this has been a nightmare. Ive included the documents you need the receipts the messages Ive sent screenshots showing I was reported to XXXX twice since Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I not only want my mortgage payments applied correctly, I want the XXXX ( XXXX ) reports to XXXX to be removed. My credit should not take a hit because the bank made the mistake."
Mortgage,"Bank of America still has not sent 1099 as of XX/XX/2021, even though they were required by law to send this statement as of XX/XX/2021. I have called them many times, and they say go to the website. I can not use the website since the account is paid off and I have no internet access anymore since the account is closed. 
I have had trouble with Bank of America not answering my questions for over 15 years, and this is not the first time they have been non-responsive. In the past I had two mortgages and asked them why the PMI on one mortgage when down every month whereas the other one never changed. They were never able to answer the question. When I paid off the last mortgage XX/XX/2021, they were unable to realize the mortgage was paid off until two weeks later, so I had to pay an extra month 's interest"
Mortgage,"I initiated the request for mortgage assistance with Bank of America at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. I was unemployed from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and my new salary was reduced by 20 %. I filled out the required information, submitted the requested documents, and was promised a quick turn around. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. BOA has asked for dozens more documents, letters, revised RMAs, etc. It is never enough. This is obviously a run around process to discourage me from seeking a modification and pushing me to a refinance. I am seeking a reasonable offer to modify my mortgage ; it is currently a 15 year, XXXX mortgage, with a principal, interest, tax, and insurance payment of close to {$6000.00} a month!"
Mortgage,"I am a Realtor, representing a seller of a flooded home in XXXX, LA. The owner has flood insurance and a check has already been disbursed and forwarded to Bank of America and is in their escrow account. We now have the house under contract to be sold, and BofA will not cooperate in providing a pay-off so that the act of sale can be conducted. We have been stalled for 3 weeks, and are getting nowhere in dealing with the pay-off department."
Mortgage,The Bank of America has responded but still the issues remain unresolved to my satisfaction. I want all the money I overpaid to reduce principal at their mistakes to me.It should repaid to my XXXX account at Bank of America so I can fund future normal payments.Not one dime has been refunded as of this date.They are burying me in statements but no money has been refunded.
Mortgage,"In the course of Bank of America Home Loans, servicing activities Bank of America has engaged in the following illegal acts and practices : XXXX ) Preparing, executing, notarizing, and presenting false and misleading documents, filing false and misleading documents with courts and government agencies, or otherwise using false or misleading documents as part of the foreclosure process ( including, but not limited to, affidavits, declarations, certifications, substitutions of trustees, and assignments ) ; and XXXX ) Preparing, executing, notarizing, and filing affidavits in foreclosure proceedings, whose affiants lacked personal knowledge of the assertions in the affidavits and did not review any information or documentation to verify the assertions in such affidavits. This practice of repeated false attestation of information in affidavits is popularly known as "" robosigning. '' On numerous occasions we have sent XXXX 's requesting our mortgage note from Bank of America. On numerous occasions Bank of America stated in writing and verbally that the mortgage note was n't fake. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the "" CORPORATION ASSIGNMENT OF DEED OF TRUST '' stating Certificateholders of XXXX, XXXX XXXX Mortgage Pass Through Trust XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX EXHIBIT A ) For the past few years I have educated myself regarding SECURITIZATION. ( SEE EXHIBIT B ) Mortgage-backed trusts contain very specific provisions regarding conveyances of mortgages, notes and Assignments and most often even include the form that each document custodian must sign attesting to the delivery and acceptance of such documents. XXXX must comply with these rules regarding acquiring the mortgages therein by the closing date of the XXXX or risk losing their tax-exempt status under the IRS REMiC Rules. Mortgage-backed trusts are not allowed under their own rules to acquire non-performing loans after the closing date of the trust and add such loans to the trust. The failure of certain mortgage-backed XXXX trusts to produce XXXX has been noted by several Courts, in fact in Case C & gt ; A. No. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX BANK OF AMERICA N.A .

It is also clear that Bank of America who actually created the fraudulent document and is also listed as a Defendant in this case that documents the fake mortgage note. It is also clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC, knows my mortgage note is fraudulent. The closing date for this trust was XX/XX/XXXX and this note was put into the trust XXXX years after the closing date. ( SEE EXHIBIT D ) On XX/XX/XXXX Sub-servicer XXXX indicated that Bank of America Home Loans is responsible for the fake mortgage note and for me to provide Bank of America with the complaint and evidence regarding the fake note. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Sub-servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX also indicated that XXXX XXXX Bank of America had an influence on XXXX dual tracking our loan modification ( putting us on a work out plan while at the same time foreclosing on home ) after making XXXX trial modification payments and continuing to make payments. 
My original lender was XXXX XXXX Mortgage, a subsidiary of the bankrupt XXXX XXXX Mortgage companies, which are still in Bankruptcy. There was no evidence of any permission from the XXXX to allow the mortgage to be divested. ( PLEASE SEE FULL COMPLAINT ATTACHED )"

My Bank of America mortgage account has 30-Day delinquencies for XXXX and XXXX. My original mortgage servicer was Country Wide and was bought out by Bank of America in XXXX. Due to the recent National Mortgage settlement, Bank of America was one of the lenders who were found guilty of extensive mortgage servicing misconduct and deceptive practices during the XXXX settlement. Therefore, my 30-Day delinquencies are a result of their misconduct. 
At this time, I ask that you remove the 30 day late payment immediately off of my account and credit report."
Mortgage,"I've been struggling to keep up with my mortgage payments due to the pandemic. However I've never missed a payment but have been late several time. Bank of America is fully aware of my current financial situation. I made several request to their customer service department for a "" late fee '' waver and was denied each time. If a customer is temporarily struggle to keep up with the payments but still manages to make the payment why not try and assist the customer instead of making it even more difficult for the customer. Bank of America is extremely difficult and refuses to work with their customer during this pandemic. Here 's the latest email that I received from BOA. 


"" Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX : Thank you for your Internet inquiry addressed to the Customer Service Department pertaining to your late charges. On behalf of Customer Service, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

Per the terms of your Note, your payment is due on the first of each month and you have a 15-day grace period to assist with postal or any other mail delays during which payments may be received with no penalty.

Mortgage,"We keep getting phone calls from someone who says they are from Bank of America and wanting to talk to us about our property.

In XXXX of this year in checking my accounts online, which I do daily, a new set of accounts appeared in my online banking under the heading of XXXX XXXX. There were three loans, all with XXXX   balances, which now appeared under my account list. I spent hours on the telephone attempting to determine what these were, concerned that these were fraudulent loans, as yet unfunded perhaps but to absolutely no avail. For the record, I have never done any banking business, accounts or loans with XXXX XXXX. 
Since then, I have visited my local branch and they attempted to contact their own internal people to determine what these were, again without result. I went up the chain of command within the branch to the manager who attempted again to determine internally what these were, once again without definitive response. A service call was opened by the branch manager on XX/XX/XXXX which provided me with an email to follow up on the issue and I sent them an email indicating that if I had not received a definitive response as to what these loans were and provided any underlying documentation within thirty days that I would report the issue to the appropriate banking authorities.

Mortgage,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased my new home from the builder XXXX for {$300.00} and after it. I got in bad loan negative amortization when I did refinance with countrywide I have on that time {$50.00} equity so loan officer closed it and put me in negative amortization loan and never seen my equity and he start hiding from me. I tried to fix it to get back to normal loan because my house had equity at that time but countrywide doesn't wont to do it. After a period of time when I tried to bring my loan to a normal fix rate, the countrywide loan officer didn't answer and was hiding him to meet me. Next year we have a hard time with my wife because she had XXXX and lost her job and i couldn't afford to pay a mortgage because I worked not full time on my work. I tried to call countrywide to fix that problem but they didn't do anything to help us so we have delinquency at that time. I was calling to bank fighting to save our home to make an affordable home loan payment but countrywide no answer on this issue. Throughout this time when the housing market crash was happening, I did not leave my home, I wanted to save my house and was trying to do a home modification with that company but they were not responsive and did not want to help. After the bank of America purchased all of the countrywide  home loans, I started to work with the bank of America to work on home modification and I wanted them to work with me on my loan and help with my negative amortization loan. The delinquency on my loan grew, so in XX/XX/XXXX finally, the bank of America offered me a home modification, but in the modification program they did not offer me a reduction of my principal balance which actually made the situation worse and made the loan that much more unaffordable with {$390.00} of the principal balance. They took all of the countrywide 's mistakes and pinned them back into our loan. I am asking for assistance for helping me keep this home and help work with the Bank of America to reduce my principal balance and give us a fixed rate for this home loan. I already paid back a lot of money to loan bring back {$340.00} but still can not bring to the actual current loan balance. So I ask to help to do Bank of America reduction of the principal balance of my loan to make me affordable payment and make my loan to with fix rate of 30 years loan to keep my house which I actually keep in good condition and I feel as I living not at my home but worse than renting home."
Mortgage,I have made several payments to my mortgage that have not been credited to my account.
Mortgage,"Bank of America, in violation of their own policies, continues to receive money intended to pay principal, misapplying the monies received in order to continue to charge me interest on the monies received. Currently my balance includes over {$740.00} in excess interest charges. 

I asking CFPB to step in and explain to the Bank of America that they need to follow their own policies and stop deferring application of monies received and to apply the monies as indicated below : The Bank of America continues to hold my money paid towards principal despite my requests to have applied as intended, as listed below : Date Payment Type XX/XX/2023 XXXX Principal only XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment XX/XX/2023 {$10000.00} Principal only XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment XX/XX/2023 XXXX Principal only XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment XX/XX/2023 {$5000.00} Principal only XX/XX/2023 {$9900.00} Principal only XX/XX/2023 XXXX Principal only XX/XX/2023 XXXX Regular monthly payment The Bank of America has acknowledged they have received the above monies but they fail to correct their repeated misapplication of funds received, holding the money while continuing to charge me interest. I believe there will come a class action lawsuit which I am prepared to start. 

I have made three other complaints. CFPB incorrectly closed the last case claiming a response which was dated PRIOR to said complaint was sufficient to close the case. I hold CFPB responsible for its assistance or lack thereof as a supervising bank."

During those XXXX to XXXX years I never missed or was late with a payment. My credit score has always been in excess of XXXX and my income has stayed about the same. I recently decided to purchase another home a few blocks from where I currently live in order to downsize as I do n't need a home as large as the XXXX I have now. My intention is to sell my current home after I move. I applied with XXXX lenders to see where I would get my best deal, Merrill Lynch and XXXX Bank. I also entered into discussions with several other lenders to see what type of programs they have and have provided them with information about my financial positions to see if I was a good candidate for their preferred programs. I received an approval from XXXX Bank and was assured by all the other lenders that there would be absolutely no problem in approving me for their mortgages. However, Merrill Lynch Mortgage had refused to provide me with a mortgage. I provided them with my last XXXX years tax returns as well as an income statement for this year but they did n't request verification of any other financial records. I told them about my brokerage accounts in excess of a XXXX and a half as well as a rental home I own free and clear but they did n't ask for any verification of that information. A few days later I was told that their underwriting did not approve me because of a {$60000.00} loss on a XXXX last year as well as a XXXX % debt to income ratio. When I explained that this was an investment in an oil well that was being drilled and those costs are deductible on my taxes I was told that they have strict guidelines by the federal government that dictates who they can lend to. When I asked what guidelines they were referring to I was told XXXX. As I understand XXXX XXXX Subtitle B addresses the minimum standards for mortgages, there is no mention of a debt to income ratio or for that matter, any mention for underwriting guidelines except "" make a reasonable and good faith determination based upon verified and documented information that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay all loans on the same dwelling and applicable taxes, insurance ( including mortgage guarantee insurance ), and assessments. '' Because of their ambiguous responses to my questions and the fact that many other mortgage companies are willing to finance me, I immediately became suspicious of their motives. As I 've experienced retribution from this firm in the past as a result of me leaving, I feel that their determination was based on other reasons than what they 've expressed. My concern is that they acted in a discriminatory manner where they had no problem financing XXXX homes while I was employed XXXX but now that I 'm with XXXX they refuse to finance XXXX homes with a lower amount of debt they financed before. I believe this action warrants a complete investigation into this matter as well as an investigation into the recorded telephone conversations I 've had with their representatives. If they 're allowed to refuse mortgages based on an arbitrary "" company policy '' and hide behind nonexistent federal guidelines, than they will continue to discriminate, for any reason, against those qualified families that go to them for help in purchasing their home. If they insist on referring to federal guidelines, they need to be reminded of those real guidelines that protect the consumer from discrimination in any form."
Mortgage,"I have never been late on my mortgage payments. Loan number XXXX However, three months ago, l notice a huge increase in my mortgage bill. 
I called them and was told they made an error in my escrow account. l explained that they paid for the insurance bill which l had personally paid for as well. 
I had sent the cheque which was refunded back to me by the insurance company to Bank of America, instead of applying it to my escrow account, l was informed it was applied to my mortgage. They apologized and promised to make amends. 
Presently, the account shows that l was delinquent for both XXXX and XXXX payments. Upon my investigating further, l learned that the account was put in delinquent and reported to the three credit bureaus. Now l received a tax sales letter from the city of XXXX. Several collections calls and a 40+ points decline on my credit score.

Mortgage,"I was approved for a trial modification under the XXXX XXXX guideline, I was offered the standard modification XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX to Market LTV guideline indicates the interest rate is determined by the value divided by the outstanding balance. My numbers are $ XXXX {$190000.00} is XXXX. Anything above XXXX % then the rate is supposed to be higher. Every little bit counts at this point I have a lot of catching up to do financially. To date, my inquiry is unaddressed. I have put in calls to my Bank of America contact XXXX XXXX and no response. Since my loan was formerly in foreclosure I am only allowed XXXX point of contact that does not return calls or letters. Time is very limited as the official loan modification was to sent XX/XX/XXXX. Instead, I had sent an appeal with the original letter and appraisal. 
I would like Bank of America to return my call to discuss as I really do want a loan modification."

Mortgage,"We purchased our home with cash in XX/XX/2012. After moving in, we discovered that the plumbing in XXXX of the bathrooms required immediate repairs. As we had used all of our savings to buy the property, we needed to get a home equity loan to make the repairs. We did not have any credit so we were forced to get a loan from a private lender at exorbitant interest rates. As first time buyers, we were not aware of the fact that we needed representation at the signing, nor were we made aware of the transferring of the loan to another company before we signed. We have tried to get the interest rate lowered to no avail, so at this point we are trying to find some solution for this anchor around our necks."
Mortgage,"In a reply to a complaint # XXXX the bank 's response was that the bank has a right to foreclose on my home. I say no, they do not have that right. The documents sent with the response is not valid as the modification that was offered to me in reply to my questioning where my payments were going was withdrawn in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. Also the modification documents were signed by XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and the notary stamp is only to our signature. The bank never signed and send us a copy. The modification was never recorded even though this was an amendment for a mortgage over {$190000.00}. The modification was never submitted to the court in the filing of the lawsuit. The notice to owner submitted in the case was from the modification so the whole purpose of the modification was to have a notice to owner for a larger amount owed. My bankruptcy stands. In a notice to the bank that is recorded in XXXX XXXX Florida, Doc # XXXX B : XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX a suggestion of bankruptcy letter was sent to the bank. The bank had a fraudulent judgment that was dated XX/XX/XXXX already and never asked to lift the stay on my request for bankruptcy. My estate was closed with my homestead property intact. This bank keeps saying to contact the new servicer who would have no knowledge of what went on since XX/XX/XXXX. No you are the ones that ruined my credit and then tried to steal my home."
Mortgage,"I closed on my Bank of America home loan on XX/XX/2020. After several attempts in person, over the phone and on social media, Ive had enough! The complaint is that they are holding my overpayment from the payoff of the mortgage and they have yet to send me a satisfaction of mortgage and the excess funds. Bank of America is a conglomerate and here I am barely surviving! Every time I contact them they tell me someone will reach out and they never do. Im seeking in excess of what they owe for what they have done to affect my life."
Mortgage,"In XXXX, I was looking to refinance my house with XXXX XXXX. They told me I owed {$30000.00} more than I had told them I owed. Bank of America had added {$30000.00} in legal fees to my loan. I had been previously sued by an adjacent property owner because they wanted to use my driveway to access their property. They lost. My mortgage deed does state that the bank is allowed to charge "" reasonable "" attorney fees ( in a situation like this ) if it has the potential to seriously negatively affect the value of the property. The fees were not reasonable, and there was never a threat to the value of my property. I have an appraisal stating this fact. I retained an attorney once I learned all this, to sue the bank for the {$30000.00}. My attorneys fees ended up being {$30000.00}. The bank has agreed to remove {$30000.00} from my mortgage, and give me {$5000.00}, but they have done neither, and I don't have access to my mortgage account that I pay faithfully every month. So, I ended up paying the money I would have paid to the bank to an attorney instead, and still don't have the {$5000.00} ( that my attorney said the bank agreed to ), or access to my account. And I wouldn't have even known the {$30000.00} was added had I not applied to refinance my house."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a Bank of America Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX for our Mortgage refinance application for which an online application was submitted. A Closing cost worksheet was provided for an interest rate of 3.5 %. I received the copy pasted email below from the loan  officer : It was a pleasure speaking with you this morning! I have attached a closing cost worksheet at 3.5 % for your review. Keep in mind, this worksheet is without any pricing exceptions. If you are able to offer an email in your writing with a quote from a competing lender, I may be able to knock off some of those points. The escrow estimate, I just kept the same as what my system was quoting ( so this may be off a bit ). The collection for the new escrow account should balance and wash with the money you have in the current escrow account at closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent the email shown below to the loan  officer : It looks like you are one of our top 3 choices to work with. As we plan to select our lender and lock our rate by Monday or Tuesday, we would like to compare rates, APRs and closing costs for Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

It seems like rates have gone down a bit last Friday and XXXX is now advertising 3.25 % for one point, kindly provide us with two  Loan Estimates for a rate of 3.25 % and 3.5 %. Please include the actual escrow deposit that you will require for closing and any closing cost reductions that can still be made from the Loan Estimate you sent last Friday. 

All the lenders we spoke with are offering to beat everyone else so, just to be fair to all, we decided to just go with who can provide the best deal for Monday. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a Loan Estimate with an interest rate of 3.25 %, 0.387 points and 3.384 % APR was provided by Bank of America. On the afternoon of the same date, I confirmed via email that the rate, points and APR have not changed during the day. The loan  officer, XXXX XXXX, confirmed that nothing has changed during the course of the day and I requested to have the rate locked on the same email thread. On the same date, at around XXXX, the rate lock was confirmed over the phone by the loan officer, where he asked for and confirmed some more information to officially lock the rate and proceed with the application. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America uploaded disclosures and documents for our review on the home loan navigator website. In good faith, believing that the agreed upon rate, points and APR shown on the Loan Estimate was already locked, we reviewed these disclosures and submitted the required documents being requested. Upon further review of the loan details on the website, I noticed that the agreed upon Loan Estimate with an interest rate of 3.25 %, 0.387 points and 3.384 % APR was revised and the website was showing an interest rate of 3.25 % but the points was increased to 1.887 % and the APR increased to 3.605 %. Still believing that this was just an error on the part of the lender, I emailed the loan officer but did not get a response on the same day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I uploaded more required documents on the home loan navigator website. It was then that a revised Loan Estimate showing an interest rate of 3.25 %, 1.887 % points and 3.605 % APR was uploaded on the home loan navigator website. The loan officer sent a secure message copy pasted below : In terms of the pricing, I will need to you provide the quote from XXXX so that I can apply the pricing exception. Very similar to what you already provided. In your email, please state the points, the rate, the term, and the mortgage company. 
Example : XXXX 15  Year Fixed loan at 3.5 % with 0 points. 

I called the loan officer to clarify this and was advised that Bank of America changed the policy and that the agreed upon rate, points and APR can no longer be offered. I felt that it was betrayal of trust but as the rates were already rising during that time and to avoid going through the entire process of calling and emailing and providing all the necessary information to a different lender again, I decided to just continue with the Bank of America application even if my wife and I felt that we were manipulated. 
We eventually closed the refinance deal with Bank of America for {$320000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at an interest rate of 3.25 %, paying 1.137 % points plus {$1200.00} origination fee and 3.493 % APR. 

Is there a way we can recoup the cost of the additional points charged to us after we locked the rate on XX/XX/XXXX ( interest rate of 3.25 %, 0.387 points and 3.384 % APR )? Please let us know as we feel so helpless. Thank you so much.

Mortgage,"I had to unfortunately file for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX, XXXX. I took pains to make sure that my home mortgage with Bank of America was not included in the bankruptcy because I did not want to lose my house to foreclosure and I wanted to protect my credit for future home mortgage loans. I had to list all of my debts for the Court, so the loan was listed. One of the credit card accounts that I did include was with Bank of America. I kept making my mortgage payments in full as usual. I then listed and sold my home and paid off the mortgage through escrow in XXXX, XXXX. I kept receiving monthly statements from BofA all the time leading up to the close of escrow showing that I made my previous payments as usual and my balance right up until I paid it off. I received a XXXX form for my IRS taxes in XXXX of XXXX for the year XXXX and in XXXX of XXXX for the year XXXX showing that I paid interest that was included in my monthly payments for the year. However, when I applied later for credit I was turned down and I requested a copy of the credit report through XXXX I saw that the BofA reported that my home loan was included in my bankruptcy and that I stopped making payments as of the date of the bankruptcy in XXXX, XXXX. I requested an investigation to resolve this error through XXXX. XXXX simply sent my letter to BofA, who simply did nothing to change the status. I contacted my attorney who did the bankruptcy for me and she said it was the BofA that had to confirm with the Court that they were not included in the Bankruptcy ... which they did not do. Perhaps they got it mixed up with my credit card account or they are punishing me for the credit card account dismissal. Later, I requested another credit report through XXXX with the same results, including a request to resolve this issue to no avail with BofA. I am now appealing to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and will attach all my documentation."

Mortgage,"In the course of my 11 years having a mortgage with Bank of America, the bank has looked for every way under the sun to continue to unfairly collect escrow payments for my homeowners and flood insurance. Over 2 years ago, I requested that taxes and insurance be removed from escrow, and XX/XX/XXXX, for the first time, I was able to directly pay my homeowners premium, flood insurance premium, and taxes. XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill from XXXX for my XXXX FEMA flood certificate, which I, directly, paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX, renewing my coverage a full month before it was due to expire on XX/XX/XXXX. One week later, BofA called my insurance agent stating that I had a gap in flood coverage and they needed proof of insurance. My agent sent proof of insurance twice. Note that at the time of their query, my XX/XX/XXXX policy was STILL in effect, and I had already paid my XX/XX/XXXX renewal premium. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX issued me a refund check for the cost of the premium I paid, stating it was a duplicate payment. BofA did not notify me that they had sought & paid for coverage from XXXX on my behalf, nor did they inform me how much coverage was purchased, nor at what price. BofA later issued a letter to me stating that I now owe an additional {$210.00} per month escrow to cover the cost of the Foremost coverage. The coverage I directly purchased cost only {$1300.00} in total, or about {$110.00} per month. The letter still did not explain to me the details of the coverage BofA purchased on my behalf. 
Over the course of 3 years, I have now twice been wrongly charged for insurace gaps BofA claimed I had in coverage. In the first occurrence XX/XX/XXXX, I refused to pay the additional escrow until the dispute was settled. BofA collections began to call me - a 10 year customer at the time, with not one single late payment on my record - and aggressively threaten to ruin my credit over a dispute of less than {$100.00}. This most recent occurrence is the most deceptive attempt to retain my money in escrow for their use. I have worked with at least XXXX other mortgage providers in the last 17 years of home and investment property ownership, and BofA is the only one to have employed such blatantly deceptive and aggressive tactics to take more of my money for their use."
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2021, I was prequalified for a loan by XXXX XXXX of Bank of America in XXXX, AZ. Her NMLS ID is XXXX. I also was told I qualified for a downpayment assistance grant. On XX/XX/2021, I made an offer on a home and it was accepted. I paid an earnest money deposit of {$3000.00} and was told my closing date would be XX/XX/2021. For two weeks, I had not heard from XXXX or Bank of America regarding a time for the closing. I called, but XXXX never returned my calls. On XX/XX/2021, I was informed that the closing had to be pushed back because the underwriter wanted me to do another income driven repayment plan. I informed them about the moratorium on loan payments, but they insisted I needed an up to date plan. This decision made my student loan payments increase by {$200.00}. After I submitted the new plan, I was told the new closing would be XX/XX/2021. Once again, the day before closing, I was told I needed to submit additional information such as bank statements, etc. I submitted the information and was then told I no longer qualified for the grant program and I would have to pay 5 % down. I agreed, but the came back again stating I needed ANOTHER student loan repayment plan on XX/XX/2021 at the close of the business day. This made it impossible for me get the information because it was the XXXX XXXX XXXX weekend. 

There was a complete lack of communication by Bank of America. If I called, no one answered and I was called at the end of the business day each time documents were requested. The process was meant for me to fail and discriminatory."
Mortgage,"After a long struggle I was approved for a loan modification for my Bank of America home loan which was originally a countrywide loan. I made the trial modification payments and XXXX regular monthly payments. 
I received a letter standard delivery mail on XXXX XXXX from Bank of America, that my loan would now be serviced by a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on the following month, with not much detailed information. 
I followed my mortgage details online on the BOA website until no loan data was available on the XXXX ... and still no letter from the new service XXXX. Concerned I called Bank of America at the beginning of XXXX, who gave me no information other than the number of XXXX. I called the XXXX help line on the XXXX of XXXX and they said I should receive a welcome package, and I asked for the website information. 
I immediately navigated the website which was difficult to find where to create a new customer account only to find it could not be done yet. I tried again on XXXX and was allowed to create and see loan information. In that loan information the loan shows an addition to the recent principal of XXXX $ with no explanation of the fee, just named principal adjustment and it also shows the next interest adjustment as XXXX with no info as to what that will be, and certainly not what my modification agreement detailed. Still no welcome package received ... no statement, no information about the additional fees or who agreed to them. The original principle of this XXXX loan which at the peak of the real estate boom has now climbed to XXXX with the new servicing extortion. 
I am feeling completely victimized by this process from the original countrywide loan, to the incredible hurdles to get the modification, and now be at the mercy of more predatory loan nonsense. It 's uncontainable. I went through the home loan modification program with hope that my own tax money would help correct the injustice that was this home loan from the start, only to have the relief of being "" approved '' to now be just a gateway to more predatory practices."
Mortgage,"The main focus of the complaint is that Bank of America supposedly put a flood policy on my HELOC account on XX/XX/XXXX, AFTER they sold my original mortgage to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The only VESTED interest Bank of America had in my property AT THAT TIME was {$18000.00}, with a max loan value up to around {$24000.00} total. 

They had a copy of the Elevation Certificate for which I had to pay out of pocket, but failed to use it when they supposedly obtained coverage. They allegedly obtained coverage for {$250000.00}, which they had absolutely no right to do since their vested interest was at a MAX {$24000.00}. 

The policy shows to have been in effect from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, and yet they are wanting me to pay for a portion of the premium from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. There was NO FLOOD POLICY on my property at that time. 

I also have documentation from XXXX showing that Bank of America told them the policy lapsed on XX/XX/XXXX. If that is truly the case, why am I expected to pay premium though XX/XX/XXXX??? 

Bank of America has been sued and has had to pay retribution for requiring everyone with a mortgage to have a flood policy. They were provided with documentation showing my property was not even in a flood plain, but they failed to drop the requirement. 

Bank of America also submitted varying amounts to me for their alleged coverage. I have tried to get them to provide proof of payment, and they refuse to do so. It is their standard practice to stop returning calls so the consumer will fade away. 

I am roughly {$760.00} away from paying off my HELOC account and need to have this money removed from the escrow account so my lien can be released free and clear. I have REPEATEDLY asked Bank of America to do the right thing since XXXX and still can not find anyone competent enough there to realize all of the fraud they have committed. 

I can provide any letters/documents you may need to pursue this complaint."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has discontinued my ability to make principal loan reductions to my mortgage account online. And you can not make payments to tellers either. Since the Bank set up this new system where all payments are first applied to interest and any remainder is applied to principal. This is WRONG and should not be allowed. 
I should be able to make principal reductions at any time during the month without it being applied to accured interest instead. This IS ILLEGAL"
Mortgage,"I filed a complaint ( Case number : XXXX ) that explains : "" We received a modification agreement for our Loan number XXXX with Notice date : XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Bank of America requested us to return the signed agreement by XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX we requested via FAX to Bank of America to send us the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement to be able to sign the new modification agreement and send it back. We also asked : "" Can you please let us have more time to send sign it and send it back after we receive this information? "". We have not received this information and we still need to review it to be able to sign the agreement. 

All I asked for a fair resolution to the issue was : "" Bank of America send immediately via email the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement of the Home Equity Modification Agreement with Notice date : XXXX XXXX, XXXX to allow us to review it and sign it if we agree with the modification. '' During the past weeks I received a call from XXXX XXXX - Bank of America Resolution Specialist XXXX - who told me that Bank of America can not provide the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement. I asked him to send me this response in writing and after that I would send them back the signed modification if we agreed. Meanwhile Bank of America continues withholding the payments that we have sent on time. I did not get the reply from XXXX XXXX XXXX about the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement. The Next letter I received from Bank of America last week states : "" Your home equity loan is not eligible for a Home Affordable Modification Program because we did not receive a Home Affordable Modification Program by the date specified in our letter to you ''. ( Attached ) This is not the first agreement that I receive. We got the first HELOC home equity modification agreement during the process of modifying the XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The 1st HELOC modification on XXXX XXXX, XXXX initially offered a monthly payment of {$94.00} ; after we paid the 3 months trial the amount increased to {$190.00} which is the amount that we are paying right now. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we got a modification package with a letter that stated "" Your modification is not yet complete. Enclosed is a replacement copy of your loan modification agreement. '' and offered us {$250.00} and send someone to our home to "" help us '' sign it. We figured out that the "" Copy '' had a different amount the be paid on XXXX XXXX, XXXX of {$39000.00} instead of the initial {$3000.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we received this new modification, we requested more information, got all kind of replies but not the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement we requested several times via FAX and now a denial. 

I believe that Bank of America has infringed the law and is trying to cover it. I ask the CFPB to please find out what they have done and are doing with our money. My son has XXXX and my husband had a XXXX years ago. I am really struggling financially and I am scared. I have been paying on time and the account is current. We do not deserve this. We really need help please. All documentation is attached."
Mortgage,"I have been attempting to bring my past due mortgage up to date since XXXX of this year. I accepted a trial modification and made XXXX of these payments covering XXXX and XXXX.

I have called numerous times to inquire about the status of my account and I 'm told a different story every single time. I 've escalated this to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX who has failed to follow up in assisting me. I 've also contacted her manager XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16 but I have yet to hear from him either. I received XXXX and XXXX contact information. I have tried diligently for months to bring my account current however Bank of America has not allowed that to happen. I continue to get the run around, calling almost daily trying to sort this out and get some type of definitive resolution. I do n't know how to get higher than XXXX XXXX and I have no idea what to do from here other than plea to the CFPB to please help me."
Mortgage,"Bank of America sent me a letter stating that my mortgage payments are late. This is 100 % inaccurate. The latter states that based on their own lie they will add additional fees and take my home via foreclosure ( loss of home ). 
Can you please explain how can bank threaten me with taking my home away while I have NOT MISSED any payments. 
I tried to call them. I was on the hold for 2 hours. After 2 hours, the automated message asked me to leave my information because they could not talk to me. I am submitting the letter I received and record of my attempt to resolve this issue with them directly."
Mortgage,"Dear Sirs, I have been living in Florida since XXXX. I applied for a fixed rate HELOC. I was approved and later applied for a smaller HELOC that was variable. I noticed in the last year that my fixed rate has been raised. I inquired to the lending institution and found out that what had been offered as a fixed rate option was actually variable. To add to this, I have been receiving harassing calls stating that I haven't paid my variable HELOC payment only to discover that my variable payment was erroneously applied to the fixed payment. I feel that this entire issue is due to ineptitude, malice or a combination thereof. I feel this entire HELOC should be vacated and damages awarded."
Mortgage,"To whom th is may  concern - First, we 're exhausted ; from speaking with associate after associate and hours upon hours of phone calls, only to have different stories from different people. Nothing has been resolved. We have been in our home for 10 years 3 months & 19 days (  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  ). We have experienced problem after problem with Bank of America, since the beginning.     Focusing only on recent concerns ( not going into detail of the early years of abuse, neglect and incompetence ) I will focus on the current neglect, abuse and incompetence not to mention time, energy and total disregard for us & their mistakes and no one, especially them is holding them accountable. This is why we 're here.     This complaint is a result of a phone call from last week to our insurance company. My husband,  XXXX   XXXX  - After speaking with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  @  XXXX  ( cst ) it was brought to our attention that Bank of America  failed to   make payments to our insurance compan y ( E scrow ) and therefore we have been effectively canceled as of  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  due to non payment by Bank of America  XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   informed him that they have all the calls recorded between them    XXXX       XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  and Bank of America and if needed those calls could be used to show Bank of America 's Fault of non payment. We did n't know that our home is not covered and has n't been since  XXXX  of last year and still we do not currently have homeowners insurance. Nobody informed us. Not   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   nor Bank of America. But our escrow account keeps going higher and we continued to believe we did have coverage due to the fact that we are paying our premiums through our mortgage payment and clearly show a large portion going to insurance & taxes. Another phone call on the same day to Bank of America on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  and they told  XXXX  we are covered and they have no idea what is going on.     Today & again  XXXX   XXXX / XXXX / XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  spoke with  XXXX  @  XXXX  with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   t  oday  ( 52  minutes &  14 sec ond s ) he tol d him almost the exact opposite of what was told last week by the same company. He also called Bank of America today @  XXXX  and spoke with  XXXX   first then  transferred & then   XXXX    ( 1 hour 6 minutes and 35 second s of speaking, nothing was accom  plished ) 1 ) Bank of America has failed to make our insurance payments on time 2 ) Reporting inaccurate information to our credit report 3 ) Refusing to remove our escrow account after request after request. Today another request was made and denied.
4 )   BOA - Sent {$5500.00} to our insurance company  (  people with similar homes as ours pay $  XXXX  year  )  XXXX  told  XXXX  we do n't look at the bills we just pay them. People with  XXXX  dollar homes do n't pay  XXXX   XXXX  dollars annually in insurance. This is absolutely absurd.      5 ) B OA - Did n't follow up on re-amortization in a timely manner and did n't follow the dates and terms of the contract. Only after calling last week on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  did they put into the mail on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  and just received the contract this week. Should have all been finalized before  XXXX  of  XXXX . Of course she made excuse after excuse on why it was n't completed in the time specified back in  XXXX  of  XXXX .      6 ) Bank o f America 's Customer service is horrendous and incompetent & truly these are understatements.     We have spent many hours today ( not counting the countless hours before today ) dealing with a problem that should not be. Accountability is something that needs to start with Bank of America. When we make a mistake we are penalized with fees and penalties and when Bank of America makes a mistake we also are held accountable for their mistakes, as well.     We are in the process of filing formal complaints with CFPB, BBB and the FTC and  whomever els e we can use to hold this Bank accountable. Treatment such as theirs has to stop and when it does happen it 's time to hold them accountable.     It 's after  XXXX  on a Friday night and I have spent at l east two hours, maybe  more gathering our notes, names & numbers to draft this letter to you. This is how important this is. This is only the "" tip of the iceberg '' -this is a great place to start and we will continue to show evidence of the abuse, neglect and incompetence displayed by this bank. Most important, a lack of accountability. We have only just begun. This is the first step.      Sincerely and Respectfully,   XXXX   XXXX  &  XXXX   XXXX"
Mortgage,I have been attempting to get a loan modification and I have been unsuccessful with my mortgage company. They refuse to assist me with a modification.
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2016, the amount was XXXX. I was behind with my payments of my mortgage, I explained them that I had a hardship and they offered a modification they said that with this program I can paid monthly my mortgage without any issues. I qualified because I summited all the requirements that they asked me and later, the mortgage transferred my mortgage to other company. I paid XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, for get solved this issue but the XXXX XXXX didnt fix it. I was asking to other legal advisers and said it was a fraud."
Mortgage,"I disputed this account with the lender on several occasions. The account is more than 7 years old and contains negative information that is impacting my FICO score so it must be removed as of XXXX. It shows the last date of activity was XXXX and the account closed in XXXX. According to FTC / FCRA, negative information must be remove after 7 years of the last activity which would make the removal date be XXXX. Its not a bankruptcy or a judgment so it is past the reporting period of 7 years. I spoke with a service rep and a supervisor at XXXX on the phone on XXXX at XXXX informing them both of the dispute and the unsatisfactory results. XXXX stated the account will remain and would not be removed regardless of the negative history and the the account being reported as more than "" 120 days delinquent '' and a "" charge-off '' status because the lender is reporting the account status of "" paid and closed '' which makes the account a non-negative account in good standing. 
I want all of the negative history removed from the account or the account removed from my credit file. See my note in red on the attached pdf artifact file."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/19 mortgage application with Bank of America was processed and loan estimate was agreed upon both verbally (via phone) and in writing (confirmation for rate lock) at XXXXXXXX. However, the next day (XX/XX/19) it was requested that I write an email to loan officer falsifying that I had been offered same interest rate by competing bank in an effort to justify Bank of America extending and confirming their offer the day prior (XX/XX/19). This request was unethical as there had been no discussion about said competing bank offering the interest rate. When questioned about the request, the loan officer implied that this would be the only way I could get my desired interest rate and continue in my application process. When the loan officer was questioned about the previously discussed and confirmed interest rate from afternoon before (XX/XX/19) it was then discovered that in fact the rate had not been locked in and it would only be locked in if the email was submitted in writing for his records. This represented a very compromising position as I was in escrow and didn’t have much time to waste. However, I refused to falsify records for the sake of protecting the loan officer from the judgment of his colleagues and the leaders of mortgage sector of BOA. I requested that the bank honor the offer that was extended onXX/XX/19 but this request could not be granted. As a result of this unethical practice I ended my mortgage application with Bank of America and had to find another lender during the escrow process. It is unfortunate if this represents a common practice by banks to compete for business by requesting potential customers go on record with a lie to protect their officers. I would like to go on record with consumer financial protection bureau to make them aware of this unethical mortgage lending practice as it appears it may be common practice."
Mortgage,"I have a mortgage line of credit with Bank of America. I became 3 months behind XXXX.BOA had me apply for a modification. It took until XX/XX/XXXX to get it approved, probably because they wanted to add on over 2500 in fees. The agreement was that I would make 3 payments of XXXX per month. I made all 3 of those payments. The XXXX payment did not go through because the representative entered the wrong routing and accounting number. 

I received a phone call today XX/XX/XXXX saying I was denied a modification. My payment is XXXX which means I technically owe XXXX. I paid the trial payments of XXXX. Technically I can go into foreclosure for XXXX? This is not right or ethical. I have been trying to work with BOA for close to one year now. I need your help. In fact, this is the second complaint I have sent to you about BOA."
Mortgage,I received notification from Bank of America that my mortgage was increasing over {$400.00} per month due to the program Countrywide placed me and my ex husband on 10 years ago. When I inquired on options they placed me with the loss department advised me to contact bk and or foreclosure attorney and suggested a short sale. I have never been late on my payments and they are saying I need to proof a hardship. They are also stating they will not proceed with my request until my ex husband quit claims the property over to me first even though we have a divorce decree and I was awarded my home in 2008. When I asked why they can not record the deed at closing they stated investor guidelines require the quit claim first.
Mortgage,"XX/XX/2020 I made a payment in the amount of {$560.00}, through online banking, designated as the P & I monthly payment for XX/XX/2020 in the amount of {$430.00} and {$120.00} additional principal payment. These funds were misapplied as {$560.00} to principal curtailment. 
The first week of XXXX I emailed the mortgage lender to correct the payment, no response. 
XX/XX/2020 I had to hold for XXXX hour and XXXX minutes to speak to an associate on their customer service line, the representative had me on hold another XXXX minutes, in total over a XXXX hour phone call. I asked if they had done the reversal themselves versus opening a task for it to be done and they lied and told me that they had since it had been a XXXX minute hold for them to do it. They advised it would be correct within XXXX business days. 
I emailed again when this wasn't complete and received the below response on XX/XX/2020 : We received your inquiry pertaining to the principal payment applied on XX/XX/2020 in the amount of {$430.00}, intended to be applied to the XX/XX/2020 payment. We are in the process of obtaining additional information to address your service request number XXXX, which was submitted on XX/XX/2020. We appreciate your patience while additional information is gathered to further research your request and apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused. 
I called back again the last week of XXXX and held for 45 minutes to speak to a representative, I spoke with a male from Connecticut he told me it would be done in another XXXX business days. 
I called back again in the beginning of XXXX when this wasn't complete waited over half an hour got a rep XXXX on the line asked to speak with someone who could reverse and reapply the funds Panill id XXXX drop transferred me back into the main queue where I held another XXXX mins talking to XXXX XXXX who could not process the request and then I escalated to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who said he would escalate this as the task opened on XX/XX/2020 was supposed to be completed within 30 days and it was now past that time from. I waited another week and through online banking i can see the funds I sent were reversed on XXXX but still have not been reapplied to the XXXX payment, they have been sitting in unapplied / suspense since XXXX. I left XXXX a voicemail friday XXXX he never returned the call, I left another voicemail Tuesday morning XX/XX/2020, no response. Funds are still not applied. I have never paid my mortgage in the XXXX plus years past the XXXX of the month and I also can not make my XXXX payment until these funds are properly applied."
Mortgage,"Last fall we completed our mortgage obligations to Bank of America ( hereafter referred to as BOA ). Prior to submitting our final payment, the XXXX XXXX XXXX Collector of Revenues office sent notice to BOA regarding the outstanding Real Estate Tax payment that was to be paid by BOA as part of our escrow. At no time did I or my wife receive a copy of the tax bill either from BOA or from XXXX XXXX XXXX. This was the case during the entire term of our mortgage arrangement with BOA. We fully believed that BOA paid our 2016 Real Estate Tax bill since we received no indication otherwise. 

We did receive an escrow resolution letter from BOA ( dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 ) that referenced payments in-and-out of our escrow account, but nowhere did this letter highlight the fact that BOA did NOT pay our tax bill. 

We also received a XXXX tax statement that contained no mention of our Real Estate Taxes. It does mention several other areas that showed BOA paid {$0.00} into certain categories, but again Real Estate Taxes are significantly absent from this document as well. 

The simple facts are that ( a ) BOA had THE ONLY notification of the payment due ( that was sent via email by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX-2016 ; ( b ) BOA had escrow funds in our account ; ( c ) BOA did NOT pay the bill ; and ( d ) BOA did NOT inform us in any clear-cut way that this tax bill had not been paid. Based on the above listed items, we expect BOA to reimburse us for the {$630.00} in delinquent and interest fees that XXXX XXXX XXXX is charging us for not paying our 2016 taxes on time."
Mortgage,"Purchased my home in 2007, My loan was first with First franklin then first franklin sold my loan to Bank of America I tried with both companies to do a loan modification 11.7 % interest rate, at the time XXXX was the company Bank of America had doing loan modifications each time I would send my paper work in they kept saying they did n't get my modifications even when I went to Bank of Americas bank branch to have the paper work faxed four times in four months, I even took the modification paper work to XXXX sent them to Bank of America.

Mortgage,"XX/XX/2020 I talked to Bank of America about releasing the {$10000.00} check to me from my homeowners insurance company. They said they would get back with me. They didnt get back with me. About a month later, XX/XX/2020 I talked to them again and they said that they would accept 10 % of the current outstanding payment and recalculate the rest back into the loan and recalculate payment as they would any other time. They would take the 10 % from the {$10000.00} check and release the rest to me. I understand things have been slower with COVID, but Id really like to get this taken care of ASAP and I know that Bank of America would like to start receiving regular payments again."
Mortgage,"I have a mortgage with Bank of America. In XXXX of XXXX they billed me 2x and I paid them both. They applied the extra payment to the next month. I was fine with that. I enjoyed being a month ahead on my payments. In XXXX of XXXX, they decided on their own to stop doing that and apply it all to principal. I called and had them change it back to being an extra month ahead. Now every month they try to keep trying to apply my payments to extra principal and I have fight them to change it to a standard payment. This month they are refusing to change it to a standard payment. I have all the documentation to prove this. I understand terms and conditions of a loan can be changed if both parties agree. They continually keep trying to change back the way they want without my consent. 

Thank You, XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"The refinance application made on XX/XX/XXXX with Bank of America was canceled without notification. I believe it was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX however as of this date, XX/XX/XXXX, I have only anecdotal evidence the loan was indeed canceled. I received further documentation from Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX showing loan estimates and loan program disclosures. It appeared to me that we were proceeding accordingly with completing the loan process. I have made several attempts at understanding why however no one at the bank has come forward with any answer. I also filed a complaint on line at the bank website two weeks ago however no one has contacted me regarding the complaint. I believe I have provided all documents required to close on this loan."
Mortgage,"We have submitted XXXX requests for a loan modification to Bank of America, and are still having difficulty having our request for modification processed and are fighting possible foreclosure, despite the Historic Justice Department Settlement for Financial Fraud against Bank of America. In summary, our loan was originally with Countrywide, and it was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After 18 months and XXXX applications for a loan modification to Bank of America ( hereinafter BofA ), and numerous lies to us from BofA, our loan 's servicer, including asking repeatedly for the same documents over and over, we were denied a loan modification, for which we were qualified to receive. BofA blamed XXXX, and XXXX said they would n't do modifications because they did n't take any TARP money. We were getting different stories from both institutions, with each institution blaming the other for why we could n't receive a modification. Our loan was sold XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which did take TARP money and which does loan modifications. So, we applied again to BofA, our loan 's servicer for XXXX XXXX XXXX, for a loan modification in XXXX XXXX because we are three months late due to a temporary illness, which has been resolved. We have submitted every document requested, including a hardship letter, and answered every question, speaking with BofA representatives on almost a weekly basis. We spoke to a representative just last week again, who confirmed that they had all of the documents and information necessary from us, and that our loan modification application was in Underwriting for review. We also had received a letter confirming our application was under review back in XX/XX/XXXX. Today, XXXX XXXX, we received a letter stating that our application for a loan modification was no longer under review because the required documents had not been submitted. We called BofA today and confirmed with their representative, XXXX XXXX, that they did in fact have all of the documents, including a Schedule D from our taxes which they had requested, which we had already sent, which had been confirmed as received, and which she could see in their system, but that the file had been closed. Our file had been closed in error. We are desperately trying to avoid foreclosure. So, she said we had to re-submit our Request for Mortgage Assistance again with today 's date, along with more pay stubs from my wife, which XXXX added to what we had already sent. This is exactly what we went through before, and we are desperate to save our home. So, we have re-submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance requesting a loan modification yet again, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with additional pay stubs, which XXXX requested today during our phone conversation about our file closed in error. We need help in getting BofA to truly look at our application and give us a loan modification and not give us the run around like they did before, and like they are giving us now. That is why BofA had a huge settlement against them by the Department of Justice, but they are behaving the same way as before the settlement and are not working to help people save their homes. We need help to save our home and have not walked away from our home, like so many others. Please help us, American Citizens, save our home by making sure BofA gives us a fair chance to save our home by giving us a loan modification. We currently have an interest-only 6.5 % home loan and are just asking for a normal P & I loan with a lower interest rate ( given the much lower rates today ), so that we have a chance and do not become like many of those Americans who lost their homes, when the banks failed to work with them on loan modifications. Our loan account manager is XXXX XXXX at XXXX."

As a direct result of  XXXX  negligence and mismanagement of EHLP funds, fees and interest were added to my mortgage.   6 )  XXXX  benefited from their mismanagement of my EHLP funds because they not only were a servicer for the EHLP funds but they OWNED my mortgage note , 7  )  XXXX  refused to correct their errors and refused to instruct their servicer to reverse the charges that accrued.

XXXX /their agent contacted my housing counselor at  XXXX   XXXX  stating that I had authorized  XXXX /their agent to act on my behalf &amp; withdraw me from the EHLP program. I believe this was an attempt to cover-up the fact that  XXXX  mismanaged the funds and to have me default in the program making me ineligible from refinancing at a fixed lower interest rate.    9  )  XXXX  committed malpractice by failing to honor their fiduciary obligations &amp; responsibilities in managing my EHLP funds.

XXXX  has never accounted for the monies they "" erroneously reversed '' and never reversed the interest or charges that they caused to be assessed to my account.

Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX - I applied for a home mortgage at Bank of America, completed all the paperwork, and was told 'everything looks good by Sales Associate XXXX XXXX . 

XXXX XXXX - XXXX called to get my credit card number to charge {$470.00} for an appraisal. 

XXXX XXXX - XXXX called and told me the underwriter denied my loan because he 'did not FEEL ' my situation merited a short sale. ' ( Note : I was applying for a morgtage, not a short sale ). There was no further explanation. XXXX was very terse, not his usual business voice. I was too stunned to ask any questions, so I hung up. 

XXXX XXXX - I Faxed a letter of appeal to XXXX XXXX, Vice President and Sales Manager, asking for, among other things, an objective explanation in writing for the denial. He emailed me that he would send it to the manager of UW ( underwriter? ) department. 

On XXXX XXXX - I emailed XXXX to ask when would I receive my refund of {$470.00} for the property appraisal since the loan was denied and the property was not appraised. He emailed he would take care of it. 

XXXX XXXX - I called XXXX to find out who I should call to find the status of my Appeal Letter. I got his voice mail advising callers to call his associate, XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX and he said the files show my loan as PENDING, not denied. He said the underwriter was waiting for additional documents. I told XXXX I had emailed the said docs to XXXX on XXXX XXXX but would resend them. XXXX said I should hear something by Tuesday, XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX - Called XXXX and left a message ; Called XXXX and again asked status of loan/appeal. He said the loan had been CANCELLED and the underwriter said I had garnishments, foreclosures, bankruptcies late payments, etc. 

I had a short sale 2 1/2 years ago and XXXX XXXX discharged the loan because of a medical hardship. XXXX knew this at the beginning and thought it might be acceptable to the underwriter. In fact, he indicated a former underwriter in his department looked over my docs and thought my issues "" merited a short sale, that things looked good. '' I have NEVER had a foreclosure, late payments, etc. If that was the case why did XXXX accept my application in the first place? 
I told XXXX that was absolutely NOT TRUE and if that was the case, why was n't that information on my credit report and how could I have a credit score of XXXX. He said he did not know, he was just the messenger and he would have XXXX call me."

That's the person who calls out the signal. They suspended my husband for 2 years. He went back to the tractor-trailer driver. The conductor went back to work in 2 weeks. 
My husband was an Engineer with XXXX XXXX. He was bringing XXXX {$7000.00} a month. He was employed there for 10 years. I also discovered this house was in foreclosure twice in XXXX and XXXX.

Mortgage,"Hi, I have a home loan with Bank of America and my mortgage was about XXXX monthly. 
For some reason my taxes went up where I was included to a different percentage rate once I was classified as investor and not owner living in the property. 
So I got in touch with the county and they fixed and I sent to the bank all paper work, but when I called the bank they did not corrected my mortgage payment once my escrow was showing I own the bank almost {$2500.00} and my mortgage jumped to $ XXXX monthly. I told them I could not afford to pay that amount and it was adjusted to {$1500.00} which for my budget still high. 
I know the county still have to send me or to the bank a refund but I have no idea how long that will take. 
I guess the fight should be done between bank of America and the county, I do n't see a reason to pay for someone 's mistake."
Mortgage,"Bank of America. I was told that when my home equity loan was paid in full it would be reported that there was no late payments. The 3 month payments that were reported as late was the time Bank of America took to mark my account PAID IN FULL. This should be removed from my credit report. The second Bank Of America is my loan modification in which I was making payments to Bank of America on a trial modification. Bank of America waas to remove from my credit report these lateness reports. I would also like this removed from my credit report. The XXXX report that is wrong is XXXX, this was reported wrong as being late. I cosigned a student loan and my step son is still going to school and the payment was suspended untill he graduates. They reported the XXXX payment in arrears even though I paid them on the phone.I never received a notice from XXXX about this lateness. I also need this report removed from my credit report."
Mortgage,"To Whom It May Concern, our family has fallen victim to a bait and switch loan modification offer granted by Bank of America ( BAC ) and our investor named as, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Backed Certificates XXXX XXXX, also known as XXXX according to correspondence received from our new servicer XXXX ( XXXX ) .On XXXX XXXX, XXXX our family was approved for loan modification of our second mortgage, and was required to make 3 consecutive trial payments of {$600.00}.

Our loan was transferred to XXXX along with our 1st mortgage on XXXX, XXXX. XXXX has been unable to give us a definitive response as to why the modification did not follow our loan during the transfer, nor do they appear to be concerned with the fact trial payments were made on our second mortgage. Furthermore, the records via letters and notices reflect poor accounting of our loan and out last payment dates vary from document to document. 
See Exhibit "" C '' Various letters indicating poor accounting as to when our last payment on the 2nd mortgage loan. In addition, to the abuse of BAC and XXXX collecting trial payments illegally with a mutual commitment to modify our loan permanently ; XXXX has failed to properly validate our debt after being served with a qualified written request ( QWR ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Per RESPA 12 U.S. Code 2605, XXXX has failed to provide proper validation of debt and are missing the following documents from their response indicating possible predatory lending may also have occurred when my loan was originated and furthermore transferred multiple times. This response is incomplete to say the least and lacks multiple significant items required to prove the validity of the mortgage debt re : affidavits of transfer, XXXX Letter, etc. and is riddled with numerous violations in relation to Section 6 RESPA and TILA.

As a result our property has been stripped of equity and conceived using a falsified or stretched Appraisal Report and improper discloser of the negative impacts this loan has had on our family since its conception. It is our consensus that the loans originator failed their fiduciary responsibility to our family and this loan carried no XXXX ( XXXX ) to us in the long run.

Mortgage,"In XXXX of XXXX, we were hit with a hurricane and my husband lost his job. We contacted Bank of America and asked what could be done. They offered us a forebearance program that would freeze our payments for 6 months without late fees or penalties. They told us at the end of the 6 months we would we have to start making our payments and they would either work out a repayment plan that would increase our payments or we would have a balloon payment due at the end of our mortgage. At the end of the forebearance period we began making our payments on time for the past 6 months while trying to work on a repayment plan with Bank of America. They are making us go through a loan modification. We are in the middle of the modification and just found out that they have filed foreclosure proceedings against us and added court cost and fees. On their website it states forebearance programs result in repayment programs. We dont understand how this could be legal and want to know what our rights are. Our forebearance amount for the 6 months is XXXX. The outstanding amount is now over XXXX with the attorney and filing fees."
Mortgage,"Our complaint is a Predatory Loan ; XXXX we asked Bank of America for a line of credit and they gave us a HELOC loan in the amount of {$84000.00} which was interest only. We went back to Bank of America to see about a separate {$50000.00} equity loan for a business start up for our XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America sent out their own appraiser and appraised the home at {$460000.00}. To this date the home is still not worth this amount. In XXXX we merged the two loans together, due to the recession and as our XXXX fell behind on his individual loan payments. The next 10 years XXXX  had us on an interest only payment plan which was not clearly explained to us. After the 10 years the payments went from {$290.00} ( interest only ) a month to {$770.00} at 4.625 % principle and interest. At that time, we were threatened with foreclosure due to getting behind with the new monthly amount due. 

After 17 years, we owe more on the loan that what we took out."
Mortgage,"I was out of work for a few months in XXXX. I contacted Bank of America to inform them of the issue. Still out of work, I chose to use a credit card to make my mortgage payment. After a couple months of doing this and seeing my debt rapidly increase, I stopped using my credit card. I regained full time employment in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Bank of America to inform them that although I 've obtained full time employment, I 'm still not capable to make full mortgage payment. I was told that due to my account being delinquent that I was being sent to foreclosure. I constantly tried to work with Bank of America. I involved NACA and Home Owners Assistance programs. I kept receiving information that stated there 's no proof I live in the property. To which, I told the representative that they all are more than welcome to come over for dinner and see differently. This went on for a year. I routinely submitted the necessary documents to prove my case. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I 'm about 22,000 behind in my mortgage and I still want my home. Bank of America is not willing to help me retain my home. Instead they either want the XXXX or the home will go to foreclosure. Because I am still getting the threats of foreclosure, I am choosing to save my mortgage payments in the event I am locked out of my home by the time I get back. Not to mention, the home is not worth NEARLY the amount I owe on it. Homes in the area have sold between XXXX and XXXX. I currently owe XXXX. Even if I choose to do a short sale, I 'll still owe more than the home is worth. To proceed with the foreclosure, the home has been appraised at only XXXX."
Mortgage,"My property was sold. It was agreed with Bank of America that I would not have derogatory information reported to credit reporting agencies due to the XXXX balance of the transaction. 
That appears to be an inaccurate promise from Bank of America. XXXX and XXXX has derogatory information from XXXX and XXXX on my credit file."

Also XXXX raised my mortgage payment {$500.00} from one month to the next for a period of 12 months, because they stated that when they bought the loan from BOA they did not inform them that I was {$6000.00} unbeknown to me and that there was nothing they could do. This put me in a financial situation, that I'm just treading above water."
Mortgage,"Bank Of America wo n't help us modify a loan not even with a settlement.

Mortgage,"XX/XX/2014, we applied for a modification because our interest rate was 7.00 % on our first and 9.875 % on our second and we were going through some tough times and were trying to save money where we could. We did not have escrow at the time. Our loan was originated with Country Wide and then moved to Bank of America. We were not behind on our payments nor had we ever missed payment of taxes or insurance. At the time, we were not eligible to refi because the property value was lower then the loan balance. Bank of America added escrow and told me that if I could make three months of trial payments then they would look at combining my XXXX and XXXX, include escrow and lower the interest rate. I was also told that if I did not agree to the modification proposal that I could decline and my loan would go back to the way it originally was. We made the modification payments but when the modification proposal was delivered, my XXXX was still at 7.00 % and XXXX was still at 9.875 %. The only thing that changed was the added escrow. Since this did not benefit me in any way, I declined the modification on XX/XX/XXXX in writing. The relationship manager said to go back to making our prior payments which was {$500.00} less and the escrow account would be deleted in about 10 business days. I continued to follow up with my relationship manager because I started to get delinquent notices and he continued to tell me it was fine and that they were still working on it. I have clocked over 18 hours on the phone with BOA throughout this process. After XX/XX/XXXX, BOA told me we owed for taxes {$4200.00} and then they could delete the escrow. We paid that in XX/XX/XXXX. Then in XX/XX/XXXX they said we just needed to pay then {$4200.00} because we were behind on payments, even though we had continued to make our pre-modification payments. Once we did this, they would remove escrow and put our loan back to the way it was and refund {$2000.00} to us. We paid that and now they say they can not fix the account because we have not made our payments on time for the last 12 months. So now we have a bunch of late fees, our credit report is showing 30 and 60 day lates and we are stuck with escrow. Before this, we had never had 30 day lates. Now that home values have increased, I still ca n't refinance because our credit is reflecting negatively with our mortgage. We were promised that our loan would be fixed, our credit would not be affected and we would not be penalized for making the original loan payments with late fees once the loan decline was received by multiple people, including our relationship manager. I have talked to many people at Bank of America and am getting nowhere. I also filed a complaint with the OCC. I am worried that I may lose my job because of the negative information on my credit report. I also work for a bank and as a Loan Originator I am responsible for using my person credit responsibly."
Mortgage,Bank of America is purposely saying i 'm not sending in the required documentation for a home loan modification. I have sent XXXX by XXXX and i made copies of what they requested. I am not going to keep wasting money and gas mailing them the same things over and over again. They are doing this on purpose so they can continue to add the late payments. Bank of america did this to me last time where i took 2 years to get them to lower my payment. They are giving me the run around they keep mailing me saying they do n't have the required documentation. This is causing me real undue distress.
Mortgage,"Around XX/XX/XXXX I was in negotiating a loan Modification with then Bank of America who claims to be the refinancing junior lender. However, Bank of America was alleged to be a predatory lender in XXXX by another Mortgage lender. At the time I was currently already on a loan Modification with the senior lender in XX/XX/XXXX. The senior lender Payments was about a thousand dollars a month. Bank of America loan Modification would have been about a thousand dollars which was too much, being that I was already underwater on the house and I'm on a fixed Income. However while in negotiations with Bank of America, who continued to give me the runaround regarding the loan Modification. I spoke to 7 different people at Bank Of America who  just wanted me to send all my personal information, but never returned my phone calls and letters regarding the loan Modification. Then on XX/XX/XXXX a foreclosure was filed on the home. But the plaintiff that filed foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX was another bank not Bank of America. On XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure stated that I received a SUMMONS SERVED BY SPECIAL. PROCESS SERVER which was false. The XXXX was served to my father in New Orleans in XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX. I found out about the summons when I visited New Orleans during XXXX XXXX from my father. My first court appearance was in XX/XX/XXXX almost a year later after the foreclosure was filed. I continued to go to court on the case as I was still surprised by the whole ordeal being that I was still in negotiations with Bank of America a year prior regarding the loan Modification. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to court and the Judge alleged to have sign off on the Order Of Possession that day, the judge told me that I had 30 days to move out. I was shocked by this as I asked the Judge to give me sometime to figure this out. Plus I'm was a XXXX Veteran. So the judge said 60 days. Now I come to find out that Bank of America does not own the home. This was confirmed on or around XX/XX/XXXX. I still occupy my single family home as the current owner. Bank of America has continued to avoid answering any of my complaints after several attempts, and has not given an answer to any of my complaint as well. However Bank Of America keep sending unknown people to harass me and my family to fraudulently take my home."

I have doubt with those two employees who were handling my application, he did intentionally mishandled my application. They are two employees one is manager and another home service specialist who were did something wrong on my application. I did everything from my side. I am depressed and mentally tortured from it. I need help please."
Mortgage,"I have multi complaints with Bank of America starting from XX/XX/XXXX. During this complaint process I have had too many "" single points of contact '' to keep track of. I also have asked multi contacts to correct my Credit Report, where BofA says I did n't pay my mortgage. 
I received a letter from them in XX/XX/XXXX saying they would get my Credit Report corrected and they still have not done so. I also asked my most recent Contact person to look into before closing the last complaint w/ CFPB, which I was told that BofA believes they are correct and that I did n't pay or did n't pay on time. My Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, did some research for me and we are easily able to prove, again, that I did infact pay on time and in full. Please see attached."
Mortgage,"1. In letter dated XX/XX/XXXX received notice from lender, Bank of America, that wind insurance is required to protect its collateral interest in property supporting mortgage loan of {$420000.00}. Said loan had been extended in early XXXX based on house value estimated to be approximately {>= $1,000,000}. Letter indicated that failure to provide would result in bank obtaining "" lender placed insurance '' which could be significantly more expensive than what we could obtain in the market. 
2.Lender had accepted coverage without wind since renewal of policy provided by XXXX XXXX    XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
3. On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I began a long delayed vacation to XXXX where we had previously lived to visit friends. As we were to be moving around we could not have mail forwarded. Those who needed to contact us could do so via email or telephone as we had cell phones and laptop with us.I have received many communications from Bank of America both by email and text so the bank could have reached us by those means if it was deemed important.There were two more ground mail attempts to contact us, in XXXX and XXXX. 
4.Upon our return in XXXX we moved to put wind insurance in place which was accomplished on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX,, the bank sent a letter saying that lender placed insurance had been bought showing only Bank of America as beneficiary based upon house value of {>= $1,000,000} at an annual premium of {$62000.00}. the bank has subsequently refunded all but {$20000.00} of that amount leaving us with a charge to our mortgage account representing coverage from XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX XXXX. By comparison the wind insurance that I obtained to satisfy the bank 's requirement costs only {$4000.00}, premium for the entire year. 
5.I am retired, XXXX years of age and can ill afford to be hit with this kind of expense which gives me absolutely no benefit ; would not seem to give any benefit to Bank of America since it was acquired ex-post facto. This is an outrages amount to pay for any casualty insurance policy, and I beg the offices of CFPB to assist me in righting this wrong. I am suffering great stress as a result of this situation and am having difficulty finding someone at Bank of America to appeal to. HELP!"
Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX and mutual agreement between XXXX XXXX XXXX and Bank America was made regarding a repayment plan on my loan # XXXX Case # XXXX On about XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to make my payment however the call center advise because my account was showing in modification status the system would n't process the payment.

Mortgage,"We refinanced our primary residence with Bank of America and closed the refinance loan in XX/XX/XXXX. We were forced to sign an owner-occupancy clause saying we intended to live in the property for the next 12 months ( until XX/XX/XXXX ) as our primary residence, despite our loan officer 's assurance in writing that this was not part of the refinance loan package. Nonetheless, we signed it and committed to living in our primary residence until XX/XX/XXXX.  However, our family 's living situation has changed and we are now requesting formal, written approval from Bank of America to move out early from our home and Bank of America to release us from having to maintain this home as our primary residence until XX/XX/XXXX. Currently, we are continuing to live in our home as our primary residence until we receive written approval from Bank of America to uphold our agreement we signed with Bank of America per the Deed of Trust, which specifically states in paragraph 6 that Bank of America can not "" unreasonably withhold '' such permission. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We faxed our explanation letter to Bank of America formally requesting release from the owner-occupancy clause. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We called Bank of America confirming they received our letter. Customer service noted that Bank of America received the letter, it has been submitted to the appropriate department, and a ticket number was created during this call and issued to us. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We called Bank of America again. Customer service stated that a letter had been sent to us saying the ticket number above was marked "" Completed, with errors. '' Customer service agent said she would contact the person handling our case. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We received a letter from Bank of America asking us to contact customer service in reference to the ticket number created when we called on XX/XX/XXXXand followed up on XX/XX/XXXX. See "" ba response 1.pdf ''. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We called Bank of America again to follow up. First representative hung up on us. Second representative stated an internal request had been sent on XX/XX/XXXX to the "" XXXX '' (? ) department, with additional requests on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We called Bank of America and representative for the first time told us that Bank of America 's written policy is not to give written approvals to early move outs. Representative stated that if we remained current on the loan, Bank of America would allow the early move out, but not in writing. However, we argued that written approval is required, and that if this policy is true about not issuing written approvals, this goes against Bank of America 's own advice to its customer, not to mention the Deed of Trust that requires Bank of America to "" not unreasonably withhold '' approval. A second ticket was created and sent to the appropriate department. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We sent our request letter to Bank of America 's RESPA Department by US Mail. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We receive second letter from Bank of America saying that our owner occupancy agreement requires us to live in our home until XX/XX/XXXX unless there are circumstances beyond our control "" OR Bank of America, N.A. consents in writing to allow [ us ] to move. '' This is the very request we are  attempting to make! See "" ba response 2.pdf ''. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We call customer service again and the representative stated the same speech as before, that Bank of America 's written policy is not to make written approvals. This is contrary to the letter we received on XX/XX/XXXX and contrary to the Deed of Trust. Representative stated that our RESPA letter was under review. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Another call to customer service. Representative said our request had been sent to their Originations department. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We again call customer service and the representative told us that we had been approved to move early, which was great, and that a letter had been mailed to us. However, the representative stated that the letter stated that Bank of America does not give written approval to move. The representative again stated that the notes on our account said we were approved, but that nothing in writing could be provided. We again argued this was unfair. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We received letter # 3 from Bank of America, which was poorly written, acknowledges our most recent mortgage payment, and only states that Bank of America never gives permissions for rental or lease of a property. This is directly contradicting what the representative on XX/XX/XXXX stated, the letter we received on XX/XX/XXXX, and our Deed of Trust with Bank of America. See "" ba response 3.pdf ''.
Conclusion : We ask that Bank of America provides us with written, formal approval that we are released from the owner occupancy clause of our Deed of Trust and the owner occupancy certification so we can move out and rent our home to one of the borrowers mother due to her job transfer. Per our Deed of Trust, such approval to move out early must be in writing by Bank of America and can not be unreasonably withheld. ( Paragraph 6 of the attached Deed of Trust. ) We want Bank of America to honor those terms.
Furthermore, we believe the CFPB should be involved in this case because if Bank of America truly does have a written policy not to give written approvals - as stated multiple times verbally by their customer service agents - then it puts borrowers in a very hard position, AND goes against the Deed of Trust that specifically says Bank of America can not "" unreasonably withhold '' approval. This catch-22 situation is exactly what the CFPB should be watching out for."

It is no secret that the mortgage industry was ruthless to buyers on the market to the point of breaking all or most of the federal existing laws that were in place as well as State laws. I purchased the Home in Ohio which often ran # XXXX in the country in foreclosures. The bank salesperson placed me with a new realtor who had not before handling me as a purchaser. I had gone through all of the proper steps of touring homes in the neighborhood, making a bid on a home I was interested in, and having a general inspection done. I was not well protected due to the inexperience of the realtor, however it was a stacked deck. The banks were manipulating the appraisals and telling the appraiser what to write the appraisal for regardless of the true value of the home, if they wanted their business. The appraiser never viewed the inside of the house. That fraudulent appraisal gave the bank the vehicle to secure the mortgage lien to the house. I have the general inspection that was done on the house in XX/XX/XXXX. It was bad enough that my current car insurance provider Nationwide would not insure the house. The banking sales person who had an office inside the real estate brokers office found an insurance company to insure the house no matter what. I was going through closing on the loan papers from countrywide with the title person who came to my mothers house after I got home from work at XXXX with no representation by my realtor to make sure things were in order and no bank representative to explain the loan. 
The title person could not review the loan with me and answer any questions that I had because he did not write the loan. The closing agent was married to the bank manager who over saw the bank salesperson I was dealing with. I told the closing officer that I should not sign the mortgage papers because I was being threatened on loosing my job and would be unable to make the loan payments. He had me sign them and told that to the bank manager he was married to. The bank salesperson called the next day and asked me if I would do anything and everything I could to keep the house financially. I said yes and the loan was processed and closed in 7 to 10 days from purchase agreement to closing and getting keys to the house. I got the keys to the house on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and lost my employment XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was forced between unemployment and very little money as a single mother of a toddler to struggle with this predatory loan which defaulted due to no money in XXXX XXXX. I received foreclosure papers on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I had to enter into bankruptcy in XXXX XXXX in a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I worked XXXX jobs while managing a toddler through five years of payments of arrearage and current payments through the discharge of the bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I defaulted again XX/XX/XXXX due to job loss and unemployment kick off resulting in XXXX dollars going to the Mortgage company. During the bankruptcy I was told by another Chapter XXXX attorney not to continue paying on the XXXX origination loan which was the HELOC at variable interest. I like many Countrywide Homeowners were told that the calvary was on the way for the egregious acts done by Countrywide Hpome Loans Mortgage company as well as BAC Home Loans mortgage company who purchased Countrywide in a merger while I was in Bankruptcy and never filed proof of claims. The story is an ongoing mess that never is fix"
Mortgage,Bank of America representatives have put my home into foreclosure. I was told that I had the option to do a deed in lieu of foreclosure but never received the paperwork. I 've put my home up for sale and have received a contract from a buyer at a price that is higher than what I owe on my mortgage balance. Bank of America representatives have not responded.
Mortgage,"Bank of america was adjusting my account for lowering the payments and did not post my sent payments to the loan to show the government that we are behind, but we paid all on time direct deposit from my account every month. So this account is paid is full and shows late payments from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. We have XXXX kids and this is hurting us whenever we go for a car loan or refinance a mortgage. Please kind help us and our family will be thankful to you"
Mortgage,"Bank of America has yet to provide me with requested documentation ; i.e., emails and contacts to all the executive officers. The only higher authority I have been in contact with is XXXX XXXX who is not only unable to provide me with the contacts, but is also unable to give me her Email contact to to send documentation. 

The only thing XXXX has done is refer to back to lower official who is requesting the same documenation I have sent several times and for several months."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX Late Charges, {$160.00} Since XXXX, been charged late fees, we pay our mortgage bill on time Our Mortgage is under Bank of America, for almost a year now the Bank have been charging us fees and late fees but we pay our monthly payments on time. When we try to address the issue with the bank, they keep saying they will get back but never and when we call we get officers behaving like telemarketers and dont help but keep you on the phone until you gave up and the charges continue to be posted in out monthly bill.

Please assist us to settle this grave issue which is affecting us especially at this COVID 19 time with very limited resources. 

Your Humble XXXX Thank you"
Mortgage,"RE : ACCOUNT NO. XXXX I am requesting a OCC complaint and a regulator who is not solely assigned to the Bank of America. Due to the many underlying factors concerning the Original Loan and Subsequent Additional Unauthorized Escrow and Insurance charges. Basically, I believe Bank of America has discriminated against and continuously violates rights. 

This request is to first inquire regarding my eligibility to refinance my original loan principal. Due to the fact, I have never missed a single principal loan payment and have approximately XXXX equity in my property/home. I was advised starting in XXXX, I should try to apply for a loan modification. Although, I did inquire about refinancing my original loan principle. I was never given any response. 

Therefore, starting in XXXX, I starting the Loan trial process. 
The original loan modification and new loan Modification monthly payment jumped from XXXX to approx XXXX ; I paid that for a 3-month period and suddenly received a notice that the original loan mod amount of XXXX was incorrect. I have copies of the XXXX coupons and a letter saying that the original amount was approved. Then they switched loan mod amounts and raise to another even higher amount of approx XXXX. Which, although i told them ... .I can not afford that extraordinarily higher 4x larger than the original payment. They do not care or listen. Therefore, my Banking Case managers mailed me a loan modification which makes fundamental harmful changes that could cause me further damages and additional already undue stress. One of the biggest issues is that the original loan did not have Escrow or Insurance included. The new XXXX payment has both been included. Even though I supplied the bank with my own personal payments to the XXXX XXXX XXXX office for my XXXX property taxes."
Mortgage,"I contacted Bank of America, our lender and servicer in XX/XX/XXXX asking for a 6 month deferment. I was advised we would have to be in default in order to obtain assistance. So 2 weeks later I called again and was told we had to be 30 past due. I called on the 31st day and was told we had to be 45 days past due. I called on the 46th day and was told we had to be 60 days past due. I called on the 61st day and was told we didn't qualify for any loan modification or assistance. President Obama announced the Making Home Affordable plan on tv. So I called BOA again to inquire. I was told we didn't qualify. I asked how did we not qualify. BOA rep said she didn't know exactly but we didn't. I found HUD 's website which had a "" See if you qualify '' link. So I filled out the information, HUD said we did qualify. So I again called BOA and again the rep said I did not. Each and every call to BOA I spoke to a different person, never the same person even when I specifically asked to speak with a person by name I had previously spoken to. I also asked if we had an account manager, I was told no we did not. I continued to call every week, each time a different person and each said the same thing ... we didn't qualify. In XX/XX/XXXX we received a foreclosure notice, the foreclosure was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. I again went to the HUD website, again HUD said we qualified and this time there was a link attached advising further assistance was available. I clicked the link which had a list of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I made contact with one. The XXXX asked me for our financial info, after which she too said we did indeed qualify. So she called BOA, it was a 3 way call which she also recorded. She spoke to the rep, gave the rep our info and the rep miraculously said we did qualify. Both myself and the XXXX   rep sent BOA the requested docs. The foreclosure was postponed while our application was under review ... per the BOA rep. We called back ( 3 way recorded call ) a week later to verify all docs needed were received. The BOA rep said yes, and said our application was under review. We called 4 times in XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of our application, each time a BOA rep said it was still under review. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from BOA attorney saying our home had been sold in foreclosure to BOA on XX/XX/XXXX. I called BOA, my call was auto routed to the REM dept. The BOA REM rep transferred my call to the Foreclosure dept. The BOA FC dept rep said I need to be assisted by the Loss Mitigation dept. and transferred my call to them. The BOA LM dept rep said I needed to speak to the Foreclosure dept. and before I could say anything he transferred my call and a few minutes later my call was disconnected. The whole call and being transferred around and place on hold took over 38 mins. And each time I had to explain to each person the reason for my call ... which was shock and disbelief because our application was "" under review '' and "" being processed ''. I was bewildered as to how they could foreclose before our application was finalized / reviewed. I called again only to be transferred around again and disconnected. So I then proceeded to call the XXXX rep, she in-turn called BOA ( 3 way recorded call ). The BOA rep said our application had not yet been reviewed and it had not yet been assigned an account manager. BOA had our application and documents in their system for over 30 days! I also received a letter from BOA advising they had cancelled our home owners insurance due to the foreclosure.

Lots of phone calls occurred over the next 2 months, as well as, I filed a complaint with the Texas State Attorney General 's office and HUD with the help of the XXXX rep. XXXX XXXX with the BOA Office of the CEO called me after the XXXX  contacted her about my complaint. Long story short, BOA rescinded the foreclosure sale, they also did lender placed hazard insurance through their own insurance company XXXX / XXXX at thrice the annual cost of our privately obtained insurance and for half the coverage we had. We were assigned an account manager, XXXX XXXX whom requested we re-apply and send in "" fresh '' financial documents. With the help of the XXXX  rep, we reapplied and sent in all required documents. The XXXX  rep called XXXX XXXX ( 3 way recorded call ) to verify all needed documents were received. In mid XX/XX/XXXX we received a "" Loan Modification '' packet from BOA. We signed all documents as required and sent them back to BOA. I called XXXX XXXX to advise him the documents were signed and being returned to him, that I would follow up within 5 days to verify his receipt of said documents. I called back to verify, XXXX XXXX confirmed the signed Loan Mod was received. Everything was good to go for our Trial Period that started on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received a noticed from the BOA Attorney stating our home was scheduled for foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX I immediately called XXXX XXXX who didn't seem to know who I was. I gave him my account number, he placed me on hold while he reviewed our account. After about 8 mins on hold, the call was disconnected. I called back the next day but the automated system did not directly connect me to XXXX XXXX as it had previously done. After several attempts for several days, I gave up and called the XXXX rep who once again called BOA ( 3 way recorded call ). The BOA rep who took our call said that the foreclosure sale will be postponed because we were in fact starting our trial period onXX/XX/XXXX. I called again onXX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX  to verify the foreclosure sale was postponed. He said it was postponed, nothing to worry about, and he proceeded to remind me that the first trial period payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX in the form of a cashiers check. I asked if I could just pay online through my BOA checking account? He said no, it must be a cashiers check and he proceeded to give me the mailing address again to send payment.

I purchased a BOA cashier check in the amount required for the first trial period payment at my local BOA branch on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX and went immediately to the post office to mail it. I then went home and called XXXX XXXX. I was advised by the man that answered my call that XXXX XXXX was on vacation ( XXXX XXXX weekend ). He also confirmed the FC sale had been postponed, our trial period started on XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and said he would make a note of my call to advise XXXX XXXX the payment had been sent per his instructions.

After work ( after XXXX ) on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a noticed from BOA Attorney that our property was sold in foreclosure to BOA. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BOA during my 15 min break ... my call was once again transferred to the REM dept, the Foreclosure Dept, the Loss Mitigation dept. I had to hang up because my break was over. I called again during my lunch hour. Again my call was transferred around, again I spent over 30 mins being transferred around and placed on hold and had to explain to each person the purpose of my call before I was finally sent to XXXX XXXX. And once again I had to remind him who I was and wait for him to review my account. After being on hole for 6 mins, I advised him my lunch break was almost over, I had 4 mins left. I asked him to review my account and find out what happened and why the foreclosure wasn't postponed and call me back during my break ( XXXX  CST ) or after work ( XXXX  CST ). BOA sent back our first trial period payment. XXXX XXXX  had me send it in twice and twice it was returned. I spent days on the phone during my breaks and lunch hour trying to get this mess cleared up. XXXX XXXX   once even advised me I should call the BOA attorney office to get the FC sale rescinded! I advised XXXX XXXX that they did not work for me, they worked for BOA and it was his job to fix his mess! He admitted that he didn't know he was suppose to notify the BOA attorney 's office to postpone the FC sale, and he admitted to not knowing how to change the codes on our account .. ergo the reason my calls were always transferred around. He said that the FC sale had to be rescinded before we could re-apply and move forward. Between XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX I paid BOA over {$10000.00} though XXXX XXXX to process the payments made by "" check over the phone '' ( he said he had to over ride the codes and I needed to keep making those trial period payments ). We received the rescind paperwork in mid XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX to re-apply. My call was automatically routed again to the REM dept. The codes were still on our account. The BOA REM dept rep I spoke to said she would send XXXX XXXX an email advising him the codes need to be removed. I never heard from XXXX XXXX. I kept calling only to be transferred around. The codes finally disappeared in XX/XX/XXXX orXX/XX/XXXX? Then in XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from a BOA rep advising me she was my account manager. She seemed very unaware of everything that occurred in XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to re-apply, to which she advised me we no longer qualified because we were over 12 months past due! I was shocked. I said no, I paid over {$10000.00} to keep our account current for the trial period. She said the money was applied to the escrow account. The escrow account consisted of {$9000.00} in hazard insurance payments for one years coverage to XXXX. I have the 3 letters from BOA where they paid {$3000.00} for 3 consecutive months. Our private home owners insurance cost less then {$900.00} a year and it had twice the coverage and only a {$500.00} deductible. XXXX / XXXX deductible is {$2000.00}. The escrow also had attorney fees for 2 foreclosure sales and the 2 FC sale rescissions, and late fees, and property appraisal fees, and misc fees.

So what is my complaint?

BOA created this manufactured default. It's been over 8 years! We still reside in the property.

* I have been asking for 8 years for an itemized detailed accounting of our account. The amount they claim we owe does not match my accounting, there is a difference of {$30000.00}.

* The lender placed insurance was their own company, conflict of interest and it was triple what we previously had with less coverage. XXXX / XXXX * We have filled out applications and submitted documents over 2 dozen times in the past 8 years. Many times BOA claims they never received our documents or they claimed they were out of date or I was told we didn't qualify but no one could ever tell us how we didn't qualify or what the requirements were. And there were months between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX that I rarely heard from BOA.

* We've had over 16 account managers in 7 years. Each time I have to start over! And NO ONE at BOA wants to take responsibility for the robo-signed FC sale or that XXXX XXXX   messed everything up due to his incompetence.

* BOA transferred the servicing of our loan inXX/XX/XXXX to XXXX  because XXXX doesn't have to honor the DOJ settlement.

* The DOJ settlement ... we're still waiting on our principle forgiveness and lower interest rate and the HARP. BOA sent us a loan modification, which is NOT the same.

* XXXX County property records shows we sold our property to BOA in XX/XX/XXXX. It also shows that the swimming pool was built in XX/XX/XXXX, it was in fact previously and correctly reported as being built in XX/XX/XXXX. It's appears BOA erroneously did so to increase the properties value? Also BOA cancelled our Homested in XX/XX/XXXX. So for the past 8 years, our property tax has been doubled. Per XXXX   County Records, BOA claims they purchased our property. How can they purchase a property twice?

* BOA made numerous hard inquiries on our credit reports, they claim it was part of the application process for HARP/MHAP. And they reported both foreclosures but never the rescissions. So our credit scores were impacted, lowered. I have letters from BOA loss mitigation dept from XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX advising we did not qualify for any programs because our credit scores were too low. The only negative items on our credit reports were BOA! They created a hardship and then used that against us.

************ It's been 8 long years of going round and round with Bank of America! I have complained over and over about their stonewalling, their incompetence, the games they play, the stress they inflict, the sleepless nights of worry that'll they'll robo-sign foreclose on us a third time. I've asked for a payoff amount, an itemized detailed payoff amount numerous times ... they send me a printout without code keys! A CPA looked it over and couldn't figure it out! And it has "" misc posting '' transactions. I've asked what is a misc posting? I get told "" I don't know '' or "" it's a late fee '', but how does an account coded as a foreclosed property accrue late fees?

And why should we pay the BOA attorney fees? The dual tracking, the manufactured default, the deceptive practices, the insurance fraud, and robo signing wasn't our doing! It was BOA. Let them pay their own attorney fees!

And why wasn't our account included in the DOJ Settlement or the Foreclosure Review or the XXXX / XXXX   settlement? Was it because BOA keep our account coded as a foreclosed property?

WHO? What government office regulates mortgage lenders and makes sure they comply with RESPA or the DOJ Settlement? The government bailed out BOA, who is bailing us out???"
Mortgage,"I have been having problems with BOA since XXXX. I finally got a hold of your organization in XXXX. By doing, so finally, BOA fixed my account and it took from XXXX to XXXX to finally get it corrected, see XXXX. 

The BOA has been calling me monthly, weekly and now daily requesting me to pay them XXXX to bring my account to current. I was paying an additional XXXX every month towards my Equity loan and again the bank continuously messed up the payments and I wind up calling the bank, seems like monthly for them to fix the account. In XX/XX/XXXX, they took the XXXX I submitted and only put the incorrect low payment on my loan and are requesting for me to pay the additional amount to bring to to current but they refuse to fix the error on their end to make me whole. I stopped paying the additional XXXX a few months back to see if the problem was me sending additional funds every month to the equity loan that was causing the problem. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX have XXXX and they have continually upset me, calling requesting additional funds and that they would fix the account. Today, the manager wasn't listening and just wanted the additional funds instead of fixing my account and bringing the a account current. 
Please help me with this mess, I can't take the stress that this situation is causing me.

Mortgage,"I sent the modification packet to bank of america for the loan XXXX. I bought the home in XX/XX/2009 (  attached HUD1 ) and got title insurance ( enclosed ). The sellers ( MLS printout enclosed ) moved to florida where they were engaged in buying foreclosures and remodeling and selling for profit as their new employment. ( Mls ) and florida has been their primary residence for the last 10 years. I have lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NM XXXX and do not own any other property. I wish to keep the house I have been using/occupying for the last 10 years."
Mortgage,"I am having serious frustration with the delay in payment posting from Bank of America Home Mortgage. The problem started XX/XX/XXXX with the implementation of a "" new system ''.

Since then, I have experienced the

following problems : 1. Serious delay and wait times in customer service, as well as non-responsiveness in the resolution of issues. 2. Payments made have not been posted to my mortgage account on a timely manner. 3. Confusing information as to the status of my mo
rtgage payments and principal balance remaining. 

For example, I made a principal payment on XX/XX/2020. To date, the amount has been deducted from my checking account but has not posted to my mortgage account. It sits as a credit without resolution. In fact, all subsequent payments have not been posted since. There are no explanations on the website as to delays. When I call in to inquire, the wait time is >60 mins and depending on the agent, one gets different responses. The first time I called in, a ticket was opened and the agent indicated that the problem will be resolved in "" 2-3 business days '', without explanation of why it didn't post. When nothing occurred within that time frame, I called again ( waited >60 mins ) and was told by another agent that the resolution time is "" 5 days '', again no explanation of why the time frame changed but offered to escalate the situation. The third time I called, the new answer was now "" 15 business days '' but strangely indicated that nothing was escalated yet. The pattern is quite apparent.

At this moment, I made payments to my account but no money has reflected on my account as a debt satisfied pursuant to my payment timeline. It feels fraudulent and Bank of America Home Mortgage either does not know that a problem exists ( no notice to the consumer regarding delays ), or knows but purposefully is not fixing the matter in hopes that it gains from the extra interest it can charge from a delay in posting my payments.

I am requesting that the money paid get posted to my account as a payment immediately without further delay and without accruing any additional interest. The payment should be reflected as of the date it was made. It has been three weeks and no notification that the issue is being resolved."
Mortgage,Bank of america just sold my loan to XXXX XXXX. I am having nothing but issues with XXXX. Because bank of america refused to send my partial payment and the payment of {$160.00} to notify XXXX. Now XXXX says I owe them {$2800.00} and I have my bank statements to prove that the payments I made to bank of america have cleared prior to XXXX taken over. I only owe them for 1 month payment which is XX/XX/2001. I tried to make my bank payment with XXXX not they say I am not allowed to make payments. I have been harassed by bank of america for 10 years and now XXXX is harassing me by falsely saying I owe them {$2800.00}. I am under bankruptcy protection. I am being discriminated against and harassed because I am a single female. They're both trying to make things as difficult as possible for me. They are retaliating against me because of the complaint I made against them by trying to make me late by blocking me to where I can't make my payment. They are trying to lie to my lawyer that I reported false information to the bankruptcy court about how much payments I was past due which was {$4500.00}. Which they was reporting on my mortgage statement. They can not except that I have filed for bankruptcy.
Mortgage,"I am in jeopardy of losing a home purchase because of Bank of America. I believe Bank of America is casting a very wide net on mortgages to scoop up as many as possible. I have been misled from the beginning of the process, starting with the loan officer telling me several times he would look into Rural Development loans because that was the kind of loan I was telling him I wanted. It wasn't until after we officially offered on a house ( thus locking ourselves into the bank ) that I was told the loan officer doesn't work with those loans. I found out more than a month later that Bank of America doesn't even deal with Rural Development loans at all, as a company. This was just the beginning. 

During a conference call the bank team even admitted the bank is having capacity issues. There is a continual lack of returned phone calls, e-mails and responses in general. Many items that were submitted continue to be on lists of outstanding documents more than a month after they were submitted and after the bank has acknowledged receipt. They have an online portal that customers are encouraged to use, yet they don't keep it up to date and it took my co-borrower almost 3 weeks  to get access because she wasn't already a BoA customer. 

We have now missed 3 closing dates with the first being XXXX XXXX ( currently XX/XX/XXXX ). The bank will not offer solid answers and are evasive with everything. They are literally saying they have no idea about a closing date and the seller is now threatening to walk about. We would be out about {$4000.00} - {$5000.00} at this point and have to start over. Plus we are renting the house we are going to move into ... ..so if we don't close we are also homeless. 

Below is just one sample of an e-mail between my realtor and the bank AVP ( XXXX ) Hi Appraisal is still pending. Commitment has been issued. Please request an extension, We have escalated this appraisal issues, as you know this is a 3rd that does not work for the bank We are waiting on the FHA appraiser. We have no information from the appraiser and we continue to reach out to our vendor management. 



XXXX please see other comments below. I will request an updated commitment letter from the previous one issued Good Morning, Today is the last day left for the extension that was asked for 2 weeks ago. The only way to get an extension from the seller until XX/XX/XXXX is to give them written proof from the bank that the only items needed for closing are the 12 month leases, which I believe you will receive today, as well as the appraisal. 

[ XXXX ] commitment letter has been issued. Please provide us the lease agreements. We are still pending the appraisal. There are some items that we as the lender need to complete on our end which is standard on FHA loans and on the commitment letter This needs to be given this morning so that signatures can be put onto the extension. 

[ XXXX ] commitment letter has been provided to buyers. Lease agreements and appraisal as the outstanding borrower conditions. 

I know that we have asked for an update on the appraisal many times and we have yet to receive any good information as to when we may have it returned. 

[ XXXX ] we continue to follow up with our vendor management. This is a 3rd party FHA appraiser that does not work for the bank. We are doing everything that we can on our end. 

At this point in the process it is completely unacceptable. 

[ XXXX ] we have escalated this issue We need a firm answer as to when the appraisal will be back and when closing can happen [ XXXX ] as soon as we have more information we will let you know. There has to be someone within the bank that can find out this information. 

[ XXXX ] we have the information in our system that we use and we continue to follow up with vendor management and have escalated this issue. 

We have also spoken over the phone and were assured that the documents that are still listed as conditions were received over 11 days ago, which is when we spoke on the phone. Why are they still listed as conditions? At this point the bank needs to get things in order, today, so that this closing can happen. 

[ XXXX ] commitment letter has been issued to clients. 
Please make all the phone calls that you need to get this done. 

[ XXXX ] we do we communicate to our teammates daily and have them reach out to vendor management. 

From here we need to have full communication. Phone calls returned and emails responded to. 

[ XXXX ] agreed. XXXX will call you today to review."
Mortgage,"The latter part of XXXX, 2010, I got a Home Equity Loan from Bank of America for {$68000.00}. This man by the name of XXXX XXXX that has contacted me on XXXX had been contacting me for months and he said the was getting a loan from XXXX XXXX who was friend of his that XXXX XXXX was a consultant. XXXX XXXX called me several times by phone which he had a New York cell phone NoXXXX and a Texas Landline No. XXXX both which I still have. XXXX XXXX told me that he had contacts at Bank of America and that I had nothing to worry about at all. On XXXX XXXX, 2010,  XXXX XXXX called me stating that he had transferred {$67000.00}. to my Home Equity loan with BOA which it shows on my statement. Bank of America put a hold on these funds for TEN business days for the funds to clear. On XXXX XXXX, 2010, Bank of America released the funds as being good collected funds so I accessed them and did a bank wire as I was told over seas. I think since BOA put a hold on these funds for TEN business days releasing them as good collected funds then they should credit this back to my loan cause if they has not released the funds as being good then I could not have accessed them at all nor would I have accessed them either.I never heard of a bank putting a hold on funds for TEN business days then them not being good funds have you? I would appreciate your help please as this has been a nightmare for me. I have met with a NC State Senator on this issue too who passed a law 104 in NC because of my situation."
Mortgage,"I recently refinanced my HELOC with Bank of America to lower my payment and specifically requested a fixed interest rate loan multiple times. During the application process my loan officer reassured me he would get me into a fixed rate loan. After 6 months of making my new payment amount, my statement had a note on it that my payment was increasing and I had a variable interest rate. My new payment amount is more than what my previous payment was after the interest rate change! I do n't understand how this happened when my loan officer reassured me multiple times the loan I was getting into was a fixed rate. On top of all of this, I now can not make my payments online anymore like I was able to with my old HELOC. When I called in to ask about this, I was advised I have to have a Bank of America account to pay my HELOC account online. That makes no sense because I could make my old HELOC payments online just fine without a BAC account. I 'm completely unsatisfied with the product I was given and having my payments be more than they used to be. This is a hardship on my financial situation."
Mortgage,"Through my BOA mortgage I pay my taxes and insurance through escrow. For some reason there is always a delay with the escrow account not paying my homeowners insurance policy with XXXX XXXX and I would like to have it addressed especially since I received a letter from the insurance company saying that they will terminate my policy by XX/XX/2020 if they do not receive payment soon. I received a similar letter from BOA dated XX/XX/2020. I received this letter on XX/XX/2020. The instructions on the letter states that I should upload my current policy to ihaveinsurance.com/bankofamerica and the loan number which was done. I think the issue stems from my property have different addresses listed with the postal service and township. The address listed with the township is ... 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX and the address with the postal service is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX These two addresses are for the same property and is listed as such on the letter I received from BOA."

This was never a conventional loan. This was an unconscionable loan set up borrower entirely to lose all her equity by intentional set up to fail by faulty loans. Further fraud found : See attached Letter/s. Fraudulent claims made that Investor would not allow any terms. Investor is stating they are Not the Investor : This is a confusing convoluted mess. Causing harm on many levels as many loans were trusted and originated at the same month ; same every thing by Countrywide this caused all loans to increase in XXXX ' CW stated upon default would rectify ; many lawsuits promised better outcomes ; none ever panned out only further harm to borrower 's entire life being affected. Every day requirements by mass servicer 's from XXXX loans equalling XXXX "" Different parties to deal with '' on daily basis causing massive abuses. BOA sent off files to sub part servicer 's who are very aggressive and breaking laws and trespassing and breaking into borrower 's properties ; interfering with the business ; and her property rights ; causing damages exceeding {$65000.00} in water damages caused ; admitted to breaking in/and claims dual roles ; acting as owner/and then admitting they are not - then recording legal documents that are deceptive and contain fraud ; Fake Assignments and false roles ; false and fake notaries ; and if raised concerns ; major abuse and retaliations that include sending men to intimidate homeowner and her family - causing Police reports ; and hospitalizations for acute stress. This has to stop. BOA is making representations and selling : Loans and Deeds to opposite persons ; This is becoming massively abusive ; since XXXX loans bring massive confusion it seems intentional as met with abuses when details are brought to the regulatory agencies. XXXX XXXX XXXX was a firm hired to answer concerns ; this firm did not answer and instead found to hold "" Altered Notes '' versions that conclude a wrong party holding wrong version - when expressed this firm created New Versions again ; and has omitted evidence that shows contrary outcomes including interfered with facts surrounding an HBOR violation for which occurred 3 separate events. Including there is a sudden Sale Date that was posted before being recorded ; and Posted when written proof of 'alternative '' offers and then Bank of America dropped borrower to a new servicer ; then took back the file - this dropped all her good efforts and caused new abuses of servicing ; This has occurred 3 X. There is evidence that she was in a review prior/and again XXXX XXXX XXXX produced a letter ; and concealed evidence that showed facts. See the letters dated : XXXX XXXX XXXX ' XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ' -- This was never admitted ; and now again ; a new path of dropping me by dual servicing roles ; then no actual follow through from Bank of America or the XXXX XXXX that was going to be used ; then reverses back and all efforts were lost and HBOR VIOLATED AGAIN. This just occurred and this faulty Notice of sale was posted inadvertently. If a WQR written or a Notice of Error it will be met with XXXX XXXX XXXX stating they "" already answered '' this is the blank excuse.

Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX we purchased our first home, our loan was sold to Countrywide 2 to 3 months later. However I was told, the amount I was paying previously, to Countrywide taking over the loan, that the principal, and interest was included. After Countrywide took over, it was brought to my attention 7 months or so later, that the principal and interest was not included, that it was just the minimum payments I had been making. I became ill with XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, I had to have XXXX XXXX, and was let go from my employer, I was then on unemployment, following that, I began on XXXX benefits, and was falling behind on my mortgage. I had always kept Countrywide informed, as I was trying to get help, as well get a loan modification.. They had kept assigning me different people, as they called them, "" work out negotiators ''. A man came by one Sunday morning, said he was through XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was from XXXX XXXX, and that Countrywide sent him, to see if I wanted to keep my home, to set up an appointment, and they would negotiate a new payment, a new contract. Once I was at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I believe his name was, began the paper work, and also said he was calling Countrywide, as he only had this number, the agreement was, a negotiator would call me, they said asked what I was looking for, an amount to modify, and they asked how much I could come up with, I went over my figures, and stated XXXX $ at the most, They stated we needed to come up with XXXX , once the negotiator contacted me, they would begin the process to lower my mortgage, after the XXXX $ was sent, after speaking to them, however no one called, and when I called multiple times, different people would tell me I would get a call back, it was months before this happened, and once someone did call, they said they had no record of the meeting with XXXX, that we agreed to pay XXXX , then following they would modify my loan, they claimed they lost the information.. I had been also paying XXXX $ and I believe XXXX cents, for 2 months, which was also a different contract, Countrywide had set up, they said if I pay that amount, for 4 months, which was for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, they would modify my loan. After I made the first payment of XXXX and change, I was then working on trying to get the next payment together, I ended up having to take my 401k out, to make the 2nd, payment, and when I tried to pay the 3rd payment, upon calling Countrywide, I was told, that the contract no longer existed, when I asked to speak to the negotiator, the man on the phone passed me through to another man, that man said that, the negotiator was no longer working with us, I asked why I was not informed of this, no letter in the mail, no call, he said he did n't know, and apologized. I have been to an attorney, a friend had asked if the attorney would look over the mortgage, he stated, after doing work like this, for over 20 years, he could n't even make heads of tales out of the paper work, the mortgage, something along the lines, it was a bit XXXX. I have also been through HAC, housing, they stated that the company was trying to get every dime they could, and with out intentions to modify our loan, advised me to not pay them another dime. At this point, Countrywide had folded, and BOA, had taken over my loan. I have also went through the HOPE line, they did not offer much hope, except that we could consider a short sale. I also tried to get help with having our local Congressman 's office, look in to our loan for us, they said they could n't find anything wrong with loan.. I have been sending paperwork, after paper work, applications for modification so forth, as well HAC, has helped me with this.. Over the last 9 years or so, BOA, has claimed they lost and miss placed numerous items, paperwork, I have sent, I sent it again, and still issues with them, they have been threatening, to foreclose for the last few years, then today I received a foreclosure sale for the property, on XX/XX/XXXX, for XXXX ... They have also failed recently, to comply, or produce, any requests I have made, for obtaining proper paper work, for the deed, and mortgage, that I sent months ago, no response, nothing.. I have been told, I was deceived, predatory lending, possibly, from the beginning of my loan, I am not sure where to turn at this point.. I am hoping for some answers, a resolution, as this has been a very stressful situation."
Mortgage,"After filling for bankruptcy ( chapter XXXX ) and making payments to a trustee for a couple years, Bank of America sent us a bill for our mortgage for {$23000.00}. Contacted them about a loan modification. Months ( more than a year ) of delays, excuses and tons of paperwork, they still foreclosed on the house. In XX/XX/2016, we moved out and they sold the house for less than the past due. It has been 7 months and they are still sending us letters stating out application for modification is being reviewed."
Mortgage,"Bank of America provides statements which make it impossible to understand how funds are actually being applied. What the statement says is simply not correct. Not unless you understand the transaction reversals, reasons for unapplied funds, etc. There is no reason it needs to be this complicated. 

Please review the Payment Posted amounts. They do not reflect the actual amount paid. They reflect the amount that is required to pay in full. 

Please see the XXXX statement and the Transaction Activity section. Why are transactions reversed and why is there unapplied funds. 

Please look at the principal paid amount for each statement. The amount for the XXXX statement is not correct. The only way to make it correct is if you can understand their accounting."
Mortgage,My mother died in XXXX Bank of America was notified that the property was in probate and the final payment was requested by the probate lawyer. I was named as administrator of the estate and when no response was received I contacted the bank and was told I had to submit a death certificate and the coast approve document indicating was administrator and once received I 'd get access to the pay off information. The bank froze my Mother 's checking account without noticing me so that the auto payments for the mortgage and the house insurance was not being paid. After not hearing from the bank I spent days of being ran around before finally getting the pay off amount on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a certified check the next day. XX/XX/XXXX I called to verify the check had been received and was told the check was on hold for a insurance payment. On XX/XX/XXXX the bank had issued an insurance on the property for the period time that they had froze the auto payment. They were also processing foreclosure on a probate property for non payment due to their having frozen the auto payment. They sent mere an email staying them works not process the pay off until I paid the additional amount for the insurance. This is what I consider as extortion and fraud since the insurance was issued in the name of my deceased parents for a period that proceeded the pay off date and was a result of their actions.
Mortgage,"I still have not received requested original loan origination documents regarding the letter I wrote on XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of America. My letter was in full detail in regards to the documents that I requested as well as notarized and proof of services as well that I sent to Bank of America. I ; m again requesting all documents and, original check payments made by me from XXXX to XXXX or alleged HELOC money withdrawal checks made by me. As well as all original loan documents as stated in my letter. Because there are several discrepancies regarding the HELOC. Also Bank of America is trying to Evict me from my home by using my spouse name to do the Eviction as if we have no connection to one another. Bank Of America is using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a cover up for the Eviction when XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stated not to have a record of my home or any involvement with my home several time via email."
Mortgage,I applied for a BOA mortgage and was approved in XXXX. The bank had several significant delays due to their own backlog that our loan did not close until the end of XXXX. The bank promised me a refund of my appraisal fee due to their delay. I never received the refund so I contacted the bank in XXXX. They assured me it would be paid. Its now XXXX and I have never received the refund. I've asked where the refund was sent ( if it was sent to a credit card as I don't have any indication on any card that it was refunded ). The people I worked with at the bank have ignored my emails and won't even respond. My loan number was XXXX under the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX. The amount owed is XXXX. The commit case was XXXX. XXXX XXXX confirmed that the payment would be processed on XX/XX/XXXX. I still haven't received the payment. I again contacted her twice and no response. I have also contacted XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX who have also not responded to my multiple emails asking for a status.
Mortgage,"I had a countrywide home loan. After several years of not paying wind insurance, they sold the loan to Bank of America. Bank of America added over {$14000.00} to my mortgage for bank-placed wind insurance when it was not required. I also got behind and used a program twice to get me back in good standing but they would always find excuses as to why they wouldn't accept payments. So they wouldn't accept them, and kept adding late fees. Eventually the loan was sold to XXXXXXXX XXXX. and when I sold my house ( did not foreclose ) for {$600000.00} I actually had to come up with money to close when my mortgage was originally {$300000.00}. They took advantage every way they could to rack up the bill. I was in the house for about 15 years."
Mortgage,i have been attempting to get a loan modification however bank of america is stalling on my mortgage file.they are not wanting to review my file because they are asking for a profit and loss statement from a CPA. i do not have a cpa. i have sent in all documentation necessary for them and bank of america continues to play games with my mortgage. i do not want to lose my house.
Mortgage,"I have an issue that requires your offices attention. Im a premier client and have maintained a 25+ year relationship with Bank of America . I recently refinanced my existing JUMBO home 1st mortgage with Bank of America and also maintain a HELOC with BofA. During the refinancing process ( for the mortgage ) I requested a modest increase to my unused HELOC ( figuring it would be easier to get it all done at once ). I was told by my mortgage banker ( XXXX XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX ) that it would be easier to increase the HELOC after we closed the first mortgage. Now I am being told ( post closing of refinancing ) that an increase to my HELOC would require an exception that BofA can not accommodate. This would have been helpful information to know prior to closing and paying nearly {$50000.00} of closing and refinancing costs. I find it unconscionable that after working with Bank of America in good faith and incurring massive costs that I now find myself forced to seek out an alternative HELOC AFTER Bank of America effectively locked me into a mortgage refinancing at a significant UPFRONT cost to me. I was clearly mislead. My refinancing business was sought after by several competing institutions but I decided to stay with BofA given the long relationship. 

Again, my HELOC request was raised during the 1st mortgage home refinancing process and I was told we will handle it after the mortgage is closed. At no time was I made aware there may be the need for exceptions."
Mortgage,"On XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX  I closed on the Home Equity Line of credit for {$100000.00} with Bank of America. I was told that I should receive my welcome package and starter checks at a later day. Today, XXXX XXXX and I still did not receive my welcome package, nor the checks. I have contacted Bank of America on several occasions starting XXXX XXXX spoke with the agent by the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - spoke with XXXX from Servicing Department XXXX XXXX XXXX - spoke with XXXX ( she created case # XXXX ) and the same day she connected me with XXXX- he assured me I will receive my welcome package and checks in 2 weeks. On XXXX XXXX I spoke with XXXX, explained her my issue again and she stated that she sees that my mailing address in the system does not contain an apartment number, however I asked the representatives before to make sure my mailing address is correct. XXXX  escalated my cases to new numbers : XXXX and assured me I will receive my documents in 16 days. I did not receive my welcome package, nor the checks as of yet. 

I feel very frustrated and disappointed by the service provided and I think the Bank is not honest with it's customers. I want help in resolving my issue and explanation and apology from the management team."
Mortgage,"1 YEAR AND 3 MONTHS TO DENY MY LOAN?? This is just wrong. Something has to be done about this. How can your department allow a bank to get away with this? It was only the first step and now my loan has tripled. 

BofA delayed a decision on the first step of my mortgage loan approval for 1 year. My current assigned representative, XXXX XXXX just abandoned me after a 1 year a 3 month runaround. 

I applied to restructure my HELOC loan OVER ONE YEAR AGO. BofA waits over ONE YEAR to finalize the first step in a loan process, only to deny my restructure then fails to explain why. 
They knew of my XX/XX/2015 deadline. I supplied the final paper work a month ago after going back in forth for over 1 year. BofA waits until after XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to send me a denial letter. 
For over 1 year, BofA kept requesting never ending additional information. Each and every time I supplied them this info, they allowed weeks to go by and then only requested more info. 

For the extension program they say I do not meet eligibility rules but will not explain why I did not meet them. For example ; BofA recommended I apply for a 40 year term loan. Now they have just denied because it is, either more or less then their requirements. They will not tell me which. Is it more or less? Do I have to much debt or not enough? 

They have changed my assigned manager at least 4 times. 

They provided me numbers to reach them with no extensions, disallowing me to reach them. 
I have sent them an entire tax return only to be requested another years tax return as they have taken so long to process this. 

Much information I have sent or faxed was re-requested again. 


B OF A HAS NOT MADE 1 ATTEMPT TO HELP ME WITH MY LOAN. NO ONE WILL HELP. 
Enclosed document will show BofA states "" We are here to help ''. 

I should qualify for the restructure of the loan. There is no reason I should not qualify."
Mortgage,"Bank of America will not stop contacting me re : a mortgage modification that I rejected back in or about XX/XX/XXXX. I am attaching a voicemail I received on XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America 's "" NEW Primary Contact ''. As you can see from all complaints that I have filed with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection , Bank of America has royally messed up my mortgage account ; violated my privacy and personal information ; misappropriated my escrow funds ; refused to accept my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment and the list goes on. Please note that I have left several messages demanding the specific BOA employees, XXXX. XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, NJ and XXXX XXXX who claims to now be handling my "" moidification '' to stop contacting me since they have no reason to do so. There is not mortgage modification that I have approved. I have also demanded XXXX to stop contacting me. This company obviously received my mortgage information from Bank of America in order to contact me, without my permission for BOA to release any of my personal information. 

Although I have requested on numerous past occasions that my mortgage account be placed BACK TO "" NORMAL '' and to remove if from the modification account they have placed it in WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR ACCEPTANCE of their proposed modification, BOA continues to harass me about my mortgage modification, which I rejected and does n't exist ; is and always has been current and they are now refusing to accept my XXXX mortgage payment that I have been trying to remit since XX/XX/XXXX, at their local BOA office in XXXX, NJ. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was caused to expend {$11.00} in XXXX fees to mail my mortgage payment to BOA via certified mail, return receipt requested. 

Most importantly, I have recently been advised by the Internal Revenue Service that they have "" flagged my XX/XX/XXXX Tax Return '' since someone else has attempted to file XXXX using my personal information. This is quite troubling since Bank of America violated my privacy by ( 1 ) employing someone who stole customers ' personal information a few years ago ; and ( 2 ) by recently providing another individual with my mortgage documentation/information, whereby I received that person 's Bank of America letter re : a rental car which was received in an envelope addressed to me. As a result of Bank of America 's failure to protect my privacy and personal information/identity, same has been stolen and the IRS will not release my XX/XX/XXXX Tax Refund. 

Please advise if you require any additional documentation and I will promptly provide same which shall confirm the fraud. Simply stated, Bank of America has violated the Federal Privacy Act, among other illegal acts."

When they received the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage statement, he noticed that the mortgage payment was not made for the month of XX/XX/XXXX but the XXXX ACH debit went through to Bank of America Escrow Account, they assumed it crossed electronically. 
On XX/XX/XXXX they received a letter from BofA Home Loan Account that they were delinquent. This is where the nightmare begins, ( See XXXX Spreadsheet ), outlining all of the phone calls, letters, in person visits, to no avail. BofA confirmed that it was their mistake and this would not impact XXXX credit. I told them to pull his credit immediately and yes it showed in arrears 30, 60, 90 days delinquent on their mortgage. His credit score plummeted to XXXX via XXXX. 

At this point at the end of XXXX, throughout XXXX and XXXX, they continuously show delinquent on their mortgage payment. Their cries for help have fallen to no avail.

Bank of America and their representatives have made knowingly false statements by representing to me material facts related to my home loan mortgage account during the modification and loss mitigation processes and are guilty of the following in violation of RESPA enforced by Regulation X, MHA HAMP Guidelines, California Civil Code 2920 through 2944.10, California Code of Civil Procedure 2015.5, and their duty owed to me as a disstressed borrower who was proactive at a time when it was clear I would not be able to continue to pay the then monthly installment amount per the XXXX Deed of Trust : Poor and Deceptive Practices ; Modification Fraud ; Mortgage Fraud ; Foreclosure Fraud ; Intentional Infliction of Emotional Disstress, and ; Negligent Emotional Disstress. 
Also, as a matter of law, regulations, and guidelines I am still considered pending in the modification and loss mitigation processes and no negative credit reporting is to occur. Specifically, the bank, the servicer, and their representatives are not to assess late fees or report a late or missed payment while workout assistance is pending and are to make any required fee adjustments and credit reporting corrections upon completion of the modification and loss mitigation processes. This has not been the case in this instance and not because Bank of America believe that I am currently pending in the modification and loss mitigation processes."
Mortgage,"My loan with Bank of America has reached 78 % of LTV ( my equity is 22 % ). They are refusing to Automatically cancel my PMI. According to HUD documentation ( XXXX ), "" The law provides XXXX situations in which borrower paid PMI may be cancel - it can be automatic or by request. Lender-paid PMI is excluded from these mandates, but requires an up front disclosure to the borrower about lender-paid PMI. 
The XXXX cancellation situations are : Automatic. In general, when the homeowner 's equity position reaches 22 percent of the original value of the property, the mortgage servicer must automatically cancel the PMI. The borrower must be current in making payments for automatic cancellation to apply. "" According to CFPB documentation ( XXXX ) "" Automatic PMI termination Even if you do n't ask your lender to cancel PMI, your lender still must terminate PMI on the date when your principal balance is scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of your home. You also need to be current on your payments on the anticipated cancellation date. Otherwise, PMI will not be terminated until shortly after your payments are brought up to date. 

It 's worth noting a termination request is different than a cancellation request. Your lender must terminate PMI even if the principal balance of your loan has not actually reached 78 percent of the original value of your home - for example, because the value of your home declined. '' I have never been late on a payment, and have always paid extra principle. My loan is over 5 years old. 
The lender is basing their denial on the "" scheduled '' date when I reach 78 %, which would not have been until XX/XX/2017, but since I always pay extra principle, that date has arrived sooner."

Mortgage,"I was trying to refinance my mortgage on my condominium with Bank of America at the end of XX/XX/2018. Once the appraisal was done and non-refundable, they started playing a "" war of attrition '' by constantly bringing up more and more questions about my condo association. Questions were asked and answered only to have more questions come up. Our association board president filled out a questionnaire and that wasn't good enough. After two months of this, I gave up at the end of XX/XX/2018. I have asked that my appraisal fee be returned but I get no response. It was clear that they were not acting in good faith and once they got a little over {$500.00} out of me, then the games began. Phone calls went unanswered. Complaints filed on their company web site went unanswered. Closing dates were set only to have them stopped at the last minute to ask more condo association questions.

Mortgage,"Re : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Washington, DC XXXX ( Bank of America Loan Number : XXXX ) I have a Countrywide MBS that Bank of America services for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who is the trustee. The loan originated in XXXX ( It is similar to or the same as the Countrywide loans at issue in this Hawaii Class Action alleging RICO violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed to a Bank of America employee who had been communicating with me from the Executive Office the HAF letter that was provided to me by the Washington, DC Government office responsible for the HAF Program and on XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed in the same letter to Bank of America ( I had previously informed Customer Service on several different occasions that I had applied for HAF assistance ). 

The Branch Manager, at the XXXX XXXX Bank of America branch in XXXX XXXX, Washington  XXXX DC faxed the letter and the Cover Page and gave me a printout of an email that indicated the fax had gone through. 

In the week of XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter that my house was in foreclosure. When I called customer service I was told that no HAF letter had been received. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX ( the day before XXXX ) I went back to the Branch and the Branch Manager again faxed in my HAF letter with a cover page. 

After it was faxed I called several different numbers on the letter I had received and left messages with three different people and then called the general number and was transferred to a supervisor who asked me what was the date of the first fax. 

He found the HAF letter and said it was simply listed as "" Fax Cover Page '' and said that's why they had not received the HAF letter. He made many notes and said that I would be taken out of foreclosure. This was exactly the same type of problem I had with modification papers not being received. 

In the last two months I have sent in many payments which have been sent back to me or not shown up on my account. I was told by one Customer Service rep the house was in foreclosure and told that I had to pay off the full loan amount of {$500000.00} to stop the foreclosure. When I explained that to a supervisor they said that it was {$110000.00} that I needed to pay to bring the loan current. 

On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America again and they said the house was not in foreclosure and that I would be able to make payments and that the hold that was on my account would be lifted. I also explained to them that the Washington Post reported on HAF on XX/XX/XXXX : https : XXXX and that I did not run the HAF office and was not responsible for their procedures. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX an attorney for Bank of America agrees that I have HAF letter and can not be put into foreclosure but has sent me a letter to the effect that I am in foreclosure. When I raised the issue with this attorney that it is unreasonable that I am having payments returned to me he said that I should contact bank of America. 

Question : How can Bank of America deny customers the right to make payments when they have a valid HAF letter. My payments should be accepted. 

Thank you.

Mortgage,"Due to a hardship, I was unable to pay my home mortgage payments. I had a first mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX and a equity line of credit with Bank of America. My home was foreclosed upon in XX/XX/XXXX. Both loans were real estate loans and the collateral was the home. MY COMPLAINT is with Bank of America who held the equity line of credit. BofA reported the loan as charged off initially. Then 30 months later, ( XX/XX/XXXX ) a BofA collection representative started calling me threatening a lawsuit if I did not pay the money owed on the equity line. I was asked and agreed to pay {$5000.00} to settle the account. I have attached the note and deed of trust for the equity line showing that the loan was secured initially by the property but in the aftermath, it should be shown on my credit as a chaarge off - settled for less than due and not a Foreclosure. The way BofA is reporting this on my credit is keeping me from purchasing another home for 3 years. I am requesting B of A report this as a charge off of a credit account and not a foreclosure."

Ive been dealing with this XXXX since 2008.
Mortgage,"My title report is showing a {$42000.00} XXXX lien under the name of Bank of America. This loan was paid off more than XXXX years ago. I am now trying to refinance and need this paid off lien reconveyed immediately. I also demand that I be paid the {$500.00} penalty due to me under CAL. CIV. CODE 2941 : California Code - Section 2941 : d ) The violation of this section shall make the violator liable to the person affected by the violation for all damages which that person may sustain by reason of the violation, and shall require that the violator forfeit to that person the sum of XXXX hundred dollars ( {$500.00} ). -My damages will far exceed the {$500.00} you must pay me now, if my refinance is in any way delayed or does not take place as a result of Bank of America 's error in failing to reconvey title timely. 

Thank you."
Mortgage,"Until approximately 2 years ago I believed that in XXXX of XXXX. I had purchased a manufactured home on a lot that would qualify for FHA financing. I was forced to stop making in payments in XXXX XXXX because of a job loss. After several years of trying to figure out why B o A refused to assist me with my very deeply underwater mortgage, I filed suit against Major Mortgage with B of A as successor in interest for appraisal fraud when I discovered that my house had been moved from where it had previously been lived in ( in violation of XXXX underwriting guidelines ) and that the appraisal was fraudulent. Several investigational activities were conducted and it was later discovered that the original title report was performed only on the lot and did not include the house. This issue was not part of my original suit. Additionally, I discovered that the State of Nevada performed an investigation in XXXX and determined that Trust # XXXX with XXXX XXXX, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX as beneficiaries did not own the house. They in fact never owned the house as claimed at the time of the alleged "" sale '' to me. This issue caused the State of Nevada to have XXXX XXXX hire XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to find out who the actual owner of the house was at the time of sale in XXXX of XXXX. This was required so that the state of Nevada could complete the process of converting the property together with the home as real property. I was never notified of this investigation. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX the State of Nevada Department XXXX issued an Erasure Affidavit stating that "" ... XXXX was not the owner '' as the house had been repossessed. '' It seams that a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was still the owner of record with XXXX XXXX as lien holder. This remained the case until XXXX of XXXX when title to the double wide was finally transferred to me. This appears to be a clear violation of XXXX rule stating that the "" ... sale of a property must be from the owner of record and that the transaction must not involve any sale or assignment of the sales contract. '' Bank of AmericaXXXX Foreclosure Services filed a Notice of Default on XXXX XXXX XXXX against a mortgage contract that does not exist due to the fraud committed by the seller and as per XXXX XXXX regarding the voiding of conveyances made to defraud prior or subsequent purchasers of real estate. The filing of the NOD as well as the fact that they are ignoring my Notice of Rescission ( based on the lack of legal conveyance of the title to the house at time of "" sale '' -- you ca n't legally sell a house you do n't own ) dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX is a clear indication that B of A and XXXX have no regard for the law and hope to profit against the frauds committed against me. 
Mediation was conducted in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The local attorney contracted by XXXX XXXX ( foreclosure mill ) the day before showed up without a copy of the appraisal and without the authority to negotiate anything, but with an utter disregard for the facts regarding this case."
Mortgage,"In XXXX, faced with losing our home we asked for a remodification. In XXXX, after tacking on {$40000.00}, they offered a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX remodification. This was after I had submitted 13 packages, all coming back missing documents. I have hired 5 attorneys over the years. On XX/XX/XXXX, a Judge ruled that Bank of America had violated the Arkansas Statutory Foreclosure Act, buy selling our home while we were making payments. I have filed several complaints in the beginning, with Bank of America telling me "" They did not have to do anything the government tells them to do. '' So, I sued and I ligated "" pro-se '' for years. Now, they want me to summit another loan, with the acceleration as if in full force. This is in Volitation of the Act, the Judge ruled, 'as if we had gone to trial. I believe I would have proved they violated the Tarp Agreement and I would not be still after all there years fighting to keep my home I built as the XXXX XXXX

Mortgage,"Bank of America and their cohorts will wrongfully auction off my home and property via Trustee 's Sale at public auction on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX - and knowingly so. 
As no determination by an Appeals Specialist of the Bank of America Appeals Department has generated a written decision upon completion of an appeal review and the issueance of the Appeal Report of XX/XX/XXXX granting Making Home Affordable ( MHA ) Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) Trial Payment Plan ( TPP ) to date and since recoding a Notice of Default ( NOD ) of XX/XX/XXXX publically beginning the foreclosure process, Bank of America has been engaging in dual tracking and stonewalling practices for years including, but not limited to, park and stall tactics designed to hold their customers indefinitely in limbo until separation from the mortgaged property occurs. 
To date, I have not been informed of any cancellation of Trustee 's Sale, NOD or the Notice of Trustee Sale ( NTS ) of XX/XX/XXXX by way of the recording of a Rescission withdrawing both the NOD and NTS.

Mortgage,Bank of America added between {$30000.00} to {$40000.00} to my mortgage back in 2011. They claim I did a modification but yet never signed or agreed to anything. The time they are claiming I did this I was working XXXX in XXXX. When asked for documentation proof they had none. Now my family and I are harassed every month. We are sent a package every month from Bank of America with paperwork dated 2011 to sign for a loan modification. Then a few days later they send someone to our house even on Sundays they come by. They take pictures of our house and sometimes are vehicles. I never sign anything especially since it was not something I agreed to. I have also had to block their number from calling since they call consistently. They normally demand I send money to them for the modification but the last package offered me {$500.00} to sign. They owe me at least {$30000.00} not including finance charges for what they added. I owe much more now on my principal than what was financed. This can not be legal.
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2015 I XXXX XXXX XXXX call Bank of America N.A . to follow up answer the Bank of America N.A..They supposed provided to CFPB when they ask for extension which they never answer to CFPB.

Mortgage,"We are in disagreement with Bank of America Home Loans on the denial letter for a loan modification received on XXXX XXXX, 2015. We believe that Bank of America is not acting in good faith on making this decision in our loan. Based on our current financial situation, we qualify for a modification under the Hamp Program Tier 1. We believe that we meet all qualification requirements for this program. In addition, The Net Present Value Data Input and Values Chart used Bank of America to disqualified our loan modification application is based on high predatory lending rate of 7.5 % when the current mortgage loan interest rate available on the open market is less than 4.5 %. Moreover, Bank of America stated that we have poor credit score, which is not the case because cur based on Bank of America NPV report our credit score is XXXX. In today 's credit score requirement any person can qualify for a XXXX XXXX, or FHA loan with less than XXXX score. We are here appealing Bank of America 's denial decision in our loan based on the above grounds, and we ask the Bank of America comply with all Federal, State and Local laws, and provide us with this information. We will submit copy of this complaint to Bank of America."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is reporting my equity line under Derogatory Items due to the way they report to the credit bureaus. I have never been late ever. This is adversely affecting my credit score and I am unable to refinance my other properties. The value of the property dropped, and they put this on my credit report. Its not my fault it dropped. Why is this on my credit report????"
Mortgage,"To whom it may concern, Bank of America ( BOA ) has  increased my mortgage payment for the past 4 months than sold my mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX with fees and a higher monthly mortgage payment. I asked XXXX XXXX   to explain the increase in mortgage payment. I was told they did not receive any documents form ( BOA ) only the monthly mortgage payment ; therefore, they could not explain the increase in mortgage payment. 

To provide a little background I purchased my home in XX/XX/XXXX at a fixed 4.25 interest rate currently {$190000.00} balance and a {$60000.00} balloon payment through HUD. BOA inherited my load three months after my closing date. However, BOA wasn't given any documents from my initial mortgage company XXXX. When I requested a home modification in XXXX which I was denied. BOA discovered they didn't have any of my loan documents from XXXX. Therefore, BOA filed some type of illegal court claim to have their name listed on the Deed of Trust. This battle went on for three years ending with BOA giving HUD wrights, listing HUD on my Deed of Trust and me owing HUD {$60000.00} due at sale of my home or at the end of the 30 year loan agreement. This results in me owing more on my home than the market listed value. I'm seeking a mortgage audit to save my home and receive a doable mortgage payment. 

I can be reached at XXXX Thank you in advance for any assistance with saving my home.

Mortgage,"Hello, I am writing this complaint regarding Bank of America and a loan they service where I am trustee. They refuse to provide any information on the mortgage and have sent me a letter regarding default even though I began making payments after my forbearance. 
I am responsible for managing the account as trustee and I have provided all necessary document several times over the past 2.5 years. After several faxes in branch and out of branch along with a typed letter that was mailed to them at their request. I was able to get authorized in the estate department about a year ago, but the customer service in the mortgage department still refuses to speak with me because they are a different department. 

I have provided every document they have requested on multiple occasions and have spoken with several managers at 3 different level. One manager said that they found the documentation, but that it was identified incorrectly in their system and that he didnt have authorly to authorize me, but that he would call me back. This has been the same story I have been told by two other managers since early XXXX. I have jumped through every hoop that they have asked and all I am asking is for them to be fair to me as well. They have all trust information on file, letters sent to them, faxes sent to them and I have not received any correspondence or progress on this. I have been dealing with this for two years. Any guidance and assistance would be greatly appreciated."
Mortgage,"Bank of America set a notice to our home in Florida on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX that we were required to provide proof of insurance. Due to COVID-19, we were not at our home and a second notice was sent on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America made no attempt to reach out to the insurance agent on file or reach out to us via email ( on file ) or by posting a message to our online banking account. Both XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX letters referenced that the coverage period in question was XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( the previous year 's insurance which was already on file - policy covers XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. New policy in effect covers XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). 
On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America issued another letter that we had 60 days to provide proof of insurance and the new dates of concern were XXXX XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Our insurance agent was contacted and a request for the declaration page was addressed. On XXXX XXXX, I uploaded to Ihaveinsurance.com/BankofAmerica per the notices we received. I confirmed on XXXX XXXX that the new policy was available to view. The previous year 's policy was already there which covered the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX period. We provided the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX insurance declaration page. Our policy will be renewed next XXXX so there is no reason to require insurance from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as those dates will be included in the following year 's policy. I was able to confirm that the current policy was available to view on the online XXXX XXXX XXXX portal. I then received a copy of the lender placed insurance dated XXXX XXXX through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and the cost was added to an escrow account on my mortgage for {$8000.00}. I have attempted to resolved this with numerous phone calls to Bank of America who then must go to the underwriter. I spoke to XXXX on XXXX XXXX and he sent it back to the underwriter for a response within 10 days. On or about XXXX XXXX I spoke to a very helpful customer service rep who spoke to the underwriter and assured me this would be corrected within 10 business days. On or about XXXX XXXX I spoke to a customer service rep who could see the previous details but was not able to provide assistance as it was now in the hands of the underwriter. The have repeatedly said for over 2 months that they are reviewing the policies. Our monthly mortgage has been increased to cover for lender placed insurance. This property now has two effective insurance policies in place for the same property covering the same time periods. We can not figure out how the dates of XXXX XXXX have come into place as none of our current policies have an expiration date of XXXX XXXX. Bank of America has made no attempt to correct their error. We have been account holders for over 20 years."
Mortgage,"Once again, after successfully paying my new modification for the past 2 years, Bank of America send me a statement increasing my payment from {$380.00} ( principle and interest ) to {$620.00} ( escrow flood insurance ) As in the past 5 complaints Bank of America, intends to alter the terms of the contract I have with them. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Regulatory Complaints Department XXXX XXXX Bank of America ) and I have worked together for the past 10 years trying to get my modification on terms we all could agree on. We finally agreed NO ESCROW just principle and interest. We did 3 trial payments, we signed all the paperwork and I have been paying faithfully for the past 2 years. It was agreed a 40 year modification at 2.75 % {$380.00}. I pay my own insurance and taxes. XXXX XXXX did say if I defaulted on my payment, they may have to add escrow in to the loan. I have NOT defaulted!! I just got notice from Bank Of America that they expect me to now pay {$620.00}. I did not agree to that and I can not pay that amount monthly. I pay my flood insurance yearly ain XXXX and I intend fully to continue to do so. I will be paying bank of America my agreed upon payment and nothing more. I have tried several times to reach XXXX XXXX and he does not return my calls. i have tried to come to terms with customer service and the insurance dept. and they keep switching me back and forth and are not trying to make a resolution with me. I am sure once you enter a contract with someone, you can not change the terms 2 years later. Hopefully, we can work this out without having to get an attorney involved. Bank of America is making it difficult to speak with someone with authority to help me. Thank you for anything you may be able to do to help me at this time. XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"I am told I will hear for bank of america and do not, in the numerous times I have been promised."
Mortgage,"Please reference complaints : XXXX XXXX XXXX These complaints contain 6 years of history requesting our mortgage owner Bank of America, the Servicer of mortgage, XXXX, and the second lien holder XXXX. Each time we received responses where one bank blamed another and not taking responsibility for failure to request the desired solution. After your agency 's effort, and our persistent complaining, we received approval for a deed-in-lieu. This was the desired resolution requested in those aforementioned complaints ( copies attached ). Bank of America then approved and issued a proposed deed-in-lieu ( copy attached ). 

What was requested is for us to move out in two weeks, which was impossible since we have over XXXX square feet of property, a XXXX car garage, and a partially finished basement. The moving company could not move until XXXX XXXX. Our move will be out of state. When requested to extend that date, we received no response. We have unsuccessfully sought assistance from the mortgage servicer XXXX. 

Additionally, the deed-in- lieu proposal from Bank of America 's attorneys provided no protection from further personal liability, unlike what my attorney has seen before. The wording in fact stated several times that they could seek any deficiency after they received the deed. Our sole assets are a government pension, social security and a XXXX retirement account. Bank of America 's attorneys have stated they required they include such deficiency statements with a deed-in-lieu. The same language could also be included in a foreclosure or short sale resolution. In past complaints Bank of America has taken no culpability stating XXXX is the servicer. Now, it is Bank of America and their attorneys who are culpable and need to remove the language that allows a deficiency judgement. 

Bank of America purchased the Loan from XXXX after XXXX took over the original mortgage in successor to XXXX. We were never notified of this until Bank of America issued a summons to us to start foreclosure proceedings. We have been in and out court with the bank attorneys can not explain the public record which does n't show the final mortgage, only a construction loan of {$600000.00} ; this perplexed the foreclosure judge. The public record also shows the 2nd mortgage and a home equity loan, which were with XXXX and XXXX, respectively. XXXX has agreed to defer the remaining balance to {$6000.00} to be paid by XXXX upon settlement. 

The second item stopping foreclosure is the Bank of America attorney can not reconcile the amount of the purported final mortgage amount, which is not filed in public record. However, documents provided by the attorney in court show a calculation error whereby the balance of the construction notice was to be increased by the extras added during the construction period. The balance was actually added to the original amount of the construction loan. 

ll"
Mortgage,"I modified my mortgage 6 years ago. After several failed attempts Bank of America decided to grant me the modification. We have gone through many hardships, I was excited about the approval and signed the paperwork, not knowing that a balloon payment of close to 300,00,00.00 was due even after all of the payments were done at the end of XXXX. The original balance was XXXX. So, they are receiving interest plus on the balloon payment plus what they are receiving monthly. That means the loan will be doubled, close to 1 million after its paid off!! Thats banking corruption! I thought its just the balance! How can banks get away with things like that? We are senior citizens!! Thats fraud! 
Bank of America is ripping people off! 
They need to dismiss that balloon payment!"
Mortgage,"Bank of America told me they would n't resubmit a check that bounced because I accidentally double paid but then they did resubmit the check and it, of course, bounced again. Their customer service guy, XXXX, said the check would n't be resubmitted but then the next day it was. 

The problem started when I overdrew my account in the first place. That was my fault. When I saw that the payment did n't go through, I submitted it again once I determined our account could cover it. I did n't know, however, that BoA policy is to re-run bounced payments. Thus, they ran the original payment through, which was covered, but my second payment now bounced. Knowing now that the bounced check was going to be run through again, I called BoA to stop that. I talked to XXXX who assured me the check would not be run through again. He practically glossed over my problem and started to ask me if I wanted to refinance my mortgage. I told him I wanted more assurance that my check would not be run again before he sold me anything. He assured me in a very unassuring way, so I asked for a case reference number. He said BoA. did n't have reference numbers but that my account would be noted that I had this conversation. I come to find out today that the check said would not be run again has, in fact, been run again, so now my account is overdrawn. BoA mortgage customer service is closed on weekends, so I ca n't to anybody until Monday. It 's Saturday morning now. I take responsibility for the original {$30.00} bounced check but this second one is BoA 's fault because XXXX was wrong about the payment not running through again. I might be on the hook for more fees because I have pending debit that might be overdrawn depending on how quickly BoA credits back my account on the second mortgage payment that XXXX said would be stopped. It was aggravating how he seemed to be more focused on selling me a product instead of providing customer service."
Mortgage,"After I was divorced, my ex Wife XXXX XXXX XXXX, applied for a Government back refinance of our old home, Bank Of America approved her application. At the time Bank of America sent me via XXXX documents to sign, which I DID NOT SIGN OR RETURN TO THEM. I still have the documents. 
They still approved her loan and she has been paying it on time and in full for XXXX years now. 
My complaint is that Bank of America lists loan number XXXX on my Credit Report, and despite multiple letters, refuses to remove this mortgage from my credit report. Making it look as if I already have a mortgage. And preventing me from buying my own VA financed home. Again today I was almost pre-approved for a home loan, but that house pops up. Paid on time and in full every month. But I DID NOT sign the loan app and it is not mine. And does not belong on my credit report."
Mortgage,I have homeowners assistance through HAF. They make a payment every month to Bank of America. Every month Bank of America always state that they can not find my payment that is sent from XXXX from the home owners assistant funding. They are now stating that they do not have my payment and I am 2 months past due. This has been happening so long. I am concerned about my home. HAF has proof that the payments are being applied
Mortgage,"This complaint is about a mistaken identity. 
My loan servicing had been switched to BofA in XXXX and all the time from then on paying my mortgage every month.to Bof A. 

I got a notice in XX/XX/2019 that my payment will go up from {$4400.00} a month to {$7200.00} per month starting XX/XX/2019. 
I called BofA right away about the increase on XX/XX/2019and I got an answer stating that there was a clinch in their system and also because the increase was against the government law. And my payment will be adjusted to less than {$4000.00} a month. 
I was relived by her statement and been waiting for the new statement reflecting the modified reduced monthly payment. 
But instead I received a new statement inXX/XX/2019 stating the same increase of {$7200.00}, I tried using the XX/XX/2019 to pay to pay XXXX payment but paying on the phone using the loan amount info and my SSN no. was telling me the loan no and SSN do not exist. The statement had the Bof A. And customer service accepted my payment was accepted for XX/XX/2019 by BofA with invalid loan no and borrower did not have a mortgage loan in record. I found this mistaken identity after I made my XX/XX/2019. I nytied to gat a nortgage loan officed I now know that there was really a glitch in their system on XX/XX/2019 and never corrected the mistaken identity of the borrowers name and the loan no. I could have done on XX/XX/2019 an action for refinance from BofA and was inform I do not have a mortgage account account all. I asked so many times about 10x why the loan no was stating it is invalid bot I did not get an answer. 

They had lied, deceive and covering up the mishap."
Mortgage,"I had NEVER missed a timely payment until Bank of America returned my check in XXXX XXXX, and has not allowed me to make any payments since. 
History:XX/XX/XXXX, I signed a contract with Countrywide for a Home Equity Line of Credit for {$65000.00}. My last withdrawal was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, at which point I owed {$65000.00}, for which I was paying interest only for a XXXX year period, with an option to remain interest only for another XXXX year period. After the first 5 year period, I received a notice from Bank of America that said I would be going into repayment. That may have been because I was a Countrywide customer. I called to let them know I did not have the income to XXXX my payments. I applied for loan modification then and was denied ; they agreed I did not have the income to increase my monthly payment. At that time, I was told I would have to default on my current loan before I could get help. Therefore, I went on a search for someone with the authority to review my situation and grant me the option to continue paying interest only. 
I was told Bank of America is the loan servicer and I had to contact the investor, which I did XXXX, XXXX, but still have never received a response. I have the signature card proving my letter was received. I was told several times since then, that a copy of the investor letter would be sent to me, but to date I have not received XXXX. 
During this time, I continued to pay interest only and wrote a note on each payment stub that my payment was for interest only and my account is under review while waiting for a response. 
I was not asking for anything that is not already available. To continue paying interest only was an option in my contract, and is an option in the Bank of America rules for the same time period of a loan to their HELOC customers. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a notice from Bank of America that appeared to be a scam letter stating time is running out to avoid foreclosure but not too late to apply for an alternative. I called Bank of America fraud department only to find out they had actually sent that notice, and had already filed for foreclosure. After XXXX phone calls I was told the only thing I could do was reapply for loan modification. So I did. 
Then, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was served a complaint. Unjustly so, as I was waiting for results regarding the loan modification as well as the reply from the investor. I called the "" Attorneys for Plaintiff '' but the person I spoke to would not tell me how to proceed except that I had to give a response. I could not get clarification on what that means exactly, so I wrote an explanation and filed it. 
In XXXX XXXX, after six months of sending paperwork as requested and many phone calls, I received a letter stating I do not qualify for XXXX loan modification programs ; none of which are for Home Equity Line of Credit. 
I was told to reapply. I asked for payment option information so I could make an informed decision as to what I should do. The Customer Relationship Manager ordered the information XXXX times over the next XXXX months, and could not understand why she could not obtain the data. 
In XXXX XXXX, I received a letter stating I no longer have a single point of contact. No information and no answers. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received the Court approved motion for first extension of time to file pretrial statement. 
The fact that Bank of America has forced me to default on my loan and is asking the court to allow them to purchase my home is suspect. I feel they have mismanaged my Countrywide Home Equity Line of Credit. That is another reason I was denied the XXXX loan modification ; because I would not refinance my XXXX mortgage. 
I would like to pay the contracted amount due of {$65000.00}, and ask the Court to dismiss all other unknown charges and fees. I understand the loan mismanagement and predatory behavior is a separate issue."
Mortgage,"My condo lost XXXX of its value after 2008 and I now owe more than it is worth. 
I was happy to hear about HARP, only to learn that because my mortgage did not involve XXXX or XXXX XXXX I could not qualify. 
Is this right, and is it fair?"
Mortgage,"I applied for a loan modification. Bank of America sent me a letter dated XX/XX/2016, approving a loan modification. The modified payment amount is {$2200.00}. Please see attached letter. I mailed the first trial payment of {$2200.00} to Bank of America, N.A., Payment Processing, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX. Bank of America received the first trial payment amount before the due date of XX/XX/2016. Bank of America sent me a letter dated XX/XX/2016, which stated that my first trial payment of {$2200.00} was not being applied and was being held "" in an unapplied funds account. '' Please see attached letter."
Mortgage,"I AM ATTEMPTING TO AVOID A FORECLOSURE SALE BY COMPLETING A SHORT SALE TRANSACTION. I HAVE BEEN IN ESCROW TO COMPLETE THAT TRANSACTION. BECAUSE OF BANK OF AMERICA 'S INCOMPETENCE, XXXX BUYER HAS WALKED AWAY. ON XXXX XXXX OF THIS YEAR MY REAL ESTATE AGENT FAXED INTO BANK OF AMERICA ALL REMAINING REQUIRED DOCUMENTS FROM THE BUYER. ON XXXX XXXX, XXXX, THE NEGOTIATOR COULD NOT FIND THE DOCUMENTS. FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO SEND AND VERIFY RECEIPT. THEY BUYER FINALLY CANCELLED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BUYER CANCELLED WE INFORMED BANK OF AMERICA AND WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE ANOTHER BUYER AT FULL LISTING PRICE. BANK OF AMERICA BLOCKED US OUT OF INPUTTING THE INFORMATION INTO THE XXXX USED FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL XXXX XXXX, 2015 THAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO INPUT THE NEW BUYER INFORMATION. BANK OF AMERICA DEVIOUSLY CLAIMED THE SALE WAS TAKING TOO LONG AND SET A FORECLOSURE SALE FOR XXXX XXXX, 2015."
Mortgage,"I have an interest only loan with Bank of America that is going to re-ammoritize to a XXXX year loan. My house was hit by Hurricane XXXX and has lost a significant amount of value in addition to the housing market taking a fall. My loan is not HARP eligible which would have allowed me to refinance without an appraisal thus getting out of the high risk loan I am in now. When calling Bank of America they told me they do not have an in house HARP loan that would allow me to refinance or adjust my loan for a fee. My only options from what they said is to modify the loan. In order to do so I will go on a "" trial '' payment for XXXX months. For those XXXX months they report my mortgage as late. I have worked my entire life to maintain impeccable credit. This will be devastating to my credit score. My only options beyond that are to try to sell it as a short sale or foreclose. I prefer to work within the system, I understand it is not their fault my home lost value. I just want to be able to refinance for a lower rate to make the payment more affordable. They are not willing to help. I am hoping for some advice. I have an NMLS number and have taken continuing ed. In one of the statements from the CFPB it encourages banks to refinance high risk loans with limited documentation. How do I get them to do that without affecting my credit negatively? Thank you for your time."

Mortgage,"Well my husband did here from Bank of America within the time limit you provided to them but the problem is they contacted my husband and told him that if he had any questions that he could call them and the person would be more than happy to speak to him. The person my husband talked to was XXXX XXXX in the Regulator Complaint Department at Bank of America she was XXXX women XXXX ext XXXX. Well she set some paperwork showing us some payments we made at the time and told him we could not get the HUD taken of our loan but never gave an explanation of why, plus every time my husband called back he was never able to get her. My husband has more questions like why was the HUD placed on the loan and were is all the paperwork about the modification, and why is it we nor the mortgage company we are with have any paperwork from our loan. At this time XXXXXXXX XXXX  has no paperwork about our loan with Bank of America nor do we have a paperwork about our modification. Bank of America is one of the worst Banking institution to ever work with. I would like to no were else we can report them too. We are sure that Bank of America is doing a lot of people wrong and that if a stop is not put to it there will be a lot of people victimize by them just like we are. Please let us no were else we can report them to. First complaint # XXXX Thank you for all of you help"
Mortgage,"We are in need of funds for college education for our daughter and a few projects we would like to do for home improvement. We met with a Bank customer service agent in Bank of America XXXX XXXX, MA main branch and were told our best option was a HELOC. We were put in touch with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX # XXXX. She took our application the XXXX week of XXXX, XXXX  and felt things would go well. We added my wife to the application and we were declined because of a delinquency on her credit. XXXX then asked if it would be better to resubmit and the loan officer/underwriter she spoke with said that it would be much better if I submitted by myself. That based on everything I would have no problem getting approved. I was declined again but this time due to home value to loan balance ratios. This is something that the underwriters should have known up front, the ratio requirements are very clear cut. They should have not encouraged the application. I would have looked at other areas such as parent student loan or a Parent Plus loan. With the volatility in the market due to the time I waited ( 2+ weeks ) not looking at alternatives, rates have gone up on these other loans and I missed an opportunity to lock a lower rate and save some money. These type of incompetent banking practices at this level of the institution ( I assume fairly senior staff who have experience in these types of things ). XXXX has also filed a complaint on my behalf internally and with her manager. I have no complaint with XXXX for the record. While I probably can not change anything on the loan decision, Bank of America, who I have banked with for over 20 years, should at least acknowledge their error and apologize."
Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I filed a complaint with this Agency against Bank of America. See Case No. XXXX. 

Bank of America responded to that Complaint stating it was no longer the service of the Mortgage Loan effective XXXX XXXX, XXXX, further stating those servicing rights had been transferred to XXXX Loan Servicing, ( "" XXXX '' ). The problem is Bank of America filed a foreclosure case against me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, months after it sold its servicing rights to the loan at issue to XXXX. 

I know this because on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I filed a complaint against XXXX asking if and when it filed the foreclosure case, and three ( 3 ) times XXXX refused to respond to that question. See Case No. XXXX. Further, XXXX sent a representative to my home on XXXX XXXX, XXXX because XXXX had not heard from me. That representative informed me that XXXX had no knowledge of any pending foreclosure matter. XXXX sending a representative to my home was a clear indication in and of itself that XXXX had no knowledge of the foreclosure proceeding. 

XXXX stated it halted the foreclosure process on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. See XXXX, XXXX Response at p. XXXX. However the foreclosure attorney continues to proceed in court even after XXXX halted the process indicating Bank of America is still controlling the process, not XXXX. 

This is outright fraud. I demand an investigation as to why and how Bank of America filed a foreclosure case against me long after it sold its right to do so to another servicer. 
Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter."
Mortgage,"A very large bank, Bank of America ( BOA ), holds my mortgage. I applied for HAMP relief in about XXXX XXXX, which I declined about two months later in XXXX XXXX because the HAMP offer from BOA was so low it was a joke. Not only that, the HAMP modification would have had a detrimental effect on my credit. If, in the future I needed to refinance I would be worried about the negative impact this HAMP modification would have on my attempts to refinance the loan because it would ruin my credit. So, of course I declined the offer to modify my mortgage to be in the HAMP program. However, I continue to get correspondence from BOA, almost a half year away, all mistakenly saying I am in the HAMP program and my mortgage payments are "" unapplied '' to my loan ( which means to me ... and probably my guess to third parties ... "" untimely '' or less than the full amount ). Also, note BOA has had many people "" service '' me I can not keep track of all of them. This large bank never consistently seems to know what is going on ( perhaps to their benefit ) and, I have noticed once they get something wrong, will not find it possible to correct their error. Their errors could cause people to think I have not been paying my mortgage on time ; their errors might make third parties incorrectly believe that I have received a loan modification which could negatively impact my credit ; and, perhaps even cause me to lose my home if someone else ends up making a mistake based on some of their miscommunications. This could all be a mistake on their part, or maybe a scam. I just find it incredulous their errors can not be corrected. This large bank, Bank of America ( BOA ), has written me several letters indicating that my mortgage payments, which I am timely making, have unapplied amounts. BOA, both in letters, as well as on phone calls I have had, indicate that I am in a mortgage modification program, which I am not. I continue to receive robo-error letters indicating I am in the mortgage modification program and my mortgage payments are "" unapplied '', which, in my interpretation, means they are saying are late. Note, for more detail, that I declined the HAMP modification offer by phone calls and by letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Then, months later, BOA indicated I was in the program and I wrote a letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX indicating I was not in the program. The next month, they wrote me again and said I was in the HAMP program and that my mortgages were "" unapplied '' - to me ... meaning "" late ''. Note my mortgage payments are on time and do not know what they are up to. I then wrote BOA letter a letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX indicating I was not in the program and indicated I would sue them if they did not stop this. I sent this letter to XXXX offices ( because I was getting so many other letters indicating there were XXXX or more successive people at this large bank to "" help '' me ). I called them up and said I was not in the HAMP program, and they said they agreed and that I was not late ( this has been multiple phone calls on this ). Subsequent to that phone call, just two days ago, BOA called and indicated that I was in the HAMP program according to their system! I have never agreed to a loan modification or be in the HAMP program. I have declined the terrible HAMP offer that was offered to me in XXXX XXXX, but BOA continues to send letters and have their system indicate I am ( 1 ) in the HAMP program ; and ( 2 ) have "" unapplied '' amounts paid with respect to my mortgage. I want them to : ( 1 ) stop reflecting I am in the HAMP program, which could negatively impact my credit, is incorrect and potentially harmful to me ; ( 2 ) have them to stop sending me letters indicating I have unapplied amounts to my mortgage when they are being paid on time ; and ( 3 ) correct all of the problems they are causing me because I am not in a HAMP program."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is my mortgage company, Ive had heard how difficult they are to work with homeowners before I fell behind and I said they were good. When I unfortunately fell behind its when my nightmare started. I had been denied several times due to them miscalculating my income. Now I submitted a complete packet and they said there is an outstanding issue and that they cant tell me what it is over the phone. They keep telling me that its like a "" back room '' where they receive the correspondence and they answer to me through mail. They said I had to send a written request through mail to find out what that outstanding issue was. I send a written request through mail and I paid for signature, they received it and I have not heard back from them. My file was denied due to some bank statments missing, I sent them over and then they said that I was hiding income which I am not!! I sent the missing bank statements, and they denied my file, they closed it and was sent to the fraud department. To add more to this they put an auction sale on my home for XX/XX/2018, this is not fair. The sale is coming up soon, and I have no answers as to what that outstanding issue is. This has gotten my wife and I very stressed, they have the bank statements they were needing why not just continue with the review instead of closing it. So I believe this is the outstanding issue they are talking about. I wish I knew what it is so I can answer and start getting reviewed again. I really hope that they dont answer a few days before the sale and not give me enough time to reapply. I dont want my home to sell. They can check their system, they have all the documents they needed. Bank of America had a complete packet."
Mortgage,I have never been given appointments or scheduled calls with XXXX. I have had a person named XXXX follow up and leave me a random VM along with a collection department. I have made payments and have never been given disclosure that the keepyourhome california program expired and stop taking applications until XX/XX/2018. Shortly therafter bof a waited until the expiration to file this. This is not good faith or the ability to assist or help show options. I was then referred to the bofa special dept because my loan is being serviced by a special dept. I would like communication or will be forced to hire a debt defense litigator
Mortgage,"My wife and I were solicited by XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America XXXX for a better rate with potential of thousands in savings and the best ever rate on our Home Equity Loan. She promised an smooth fast and solid experience, but instead, Bank of America after running our credit reports ( mine with the wrong last name ) without our consent and without even going through the documentation they refused the loan. 
In addition, XXXX XXXX boss XXXX XXXX XXXX requested that I have to provide reports from all three credit bureaus and he is playing hard ball. Never even apologized, and tried to blame my credit retreval failure to the freeze of my credit account ( my wife 's account has a freeze too, but were able to obtain her credit score-attached, XXXX never disclosed anything about removing a freeze and we were not there anyway, never signed any documents to approve anything ). 
I personally feel that I was discriminated and I can see that there is a conflict of interest giving us the opportunity to save money. We never missed a payment, and we have multiple accounts with Bank of America, and this is not the first time we believe that we have been discriminated. 
We feel they were never intended to approve our application, although our credit is excellent, and we have a lot of equity in our home. There is no absolutely any excuse to deny our application. According to XXXX XXXX, our savings just up to end of XXXX would be about {$1000.00}, but instead we funded 2 monthly payments so far of approx. {$3000.00}. We are seeking legal advice for damages we have suffered, these people are licensed and have obligations. People responsible for our losses and frustration must be help accountable!"
Mortgage,"Bank of America reported me 30 days late on my home equity loan on XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
I no longer receive statements from them as they wanted to go paperless and rely on the information on the on-line payments section which as of today XXXX/XXXX/2015 tells me that my next payment is due XXXX/XXXX/2015. No mention of a past due ... .no contact from anyone regarding a past due. The old format of the on line payment page would disclose that information. 

I want this 30 day removed from my credit report at all all XXXX bureaus."
Mortgage,"I applied for a refinance mortgage with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, as they were advertising an interest rate which would lower my payments significantly. After months of delay, and my providing of documents and explanations for numerous requests, many of them repetitious, the bank canceled my application on XX/XX/XXXX, the day after I spent hours collecting and providing documentation for a lengthy list of demands which were requested of me earlier the same day. 

My wife and I own a large number of rental properties. I was asked to provide great detail on every single property, which I did. 

After the application was canceled, I asked my loan agent to submit a complaint in BofA 's system. I was contacted by XXXX XXXX, who told me it was canceled due to me not providing all the documentation required of them by XXXX within their maximum timeframe. My wife and I have closed on many XXXX loans, several of them within the last 6 months. Never have we been badgered for anywhere near the level of documentation that BofA insisted on. Nevertheless, I did provide everything they asked for, time after time after time. 

This is just abusive. I spent many hours at a time on many days to meet their requirements, and after dragging their feet asking for things in dribs and drabs, they say essentially, "" Oh darn, we've run out of time. Too bad. We can start over at the current interest rates which happen to be as high as your existing mortgage. ''"
Mortgage,"Diligently making my mortgage payments for the life of the loan, on XX/XX/2017, I was unable to make the final payment, due XX/XX/2017, for the {$720.00} balance due. Unable to make the payment on-line at the BOA web site, I went to the local branch in XXXX, where I live, presented the XX/XX/2017, monthly payment coupon and check for the {$720.00} balance due to Teller "" XXXX '', who was unable to accept my payment due to a "" computer error ''. Teller "" XXXX '' then contacted BOA Relationship Manager, XXXX, to request assistance. XXXX was also unable to accept my {$720.00} balance due payment to pay the outstanding mortgage in full. 

Additionally, though the web site notes a charge of {$6.00} for making an on-line payment 10 days or more past the due date, my attempt to make the payment due on XX/XX/2017 on XX/XX/2017, noted a charge of {$6.00} to make that on-line payment the day that it is due. While that was clearly a glitch, the important concern is ; why should Bank of America be allowed to charge an additional {$6.00} fee to make an on-line payment when there is already a provision to charge a late fee for payments made greater than 16 days past the payment due date. Seems lie Bank of America is pyramiding an unjustified charge of {$6.00} for the privilege of making one 's monthly mortgage payment on line before a standard late charge would kick in as in their standard mortgage contract."

Mortgage,We have found ourselves in a unfair mortgage that adds interest on the back of the loan. We owe more than the property is worth. We have recently been sent a city assessment that is XXXX less than the loan. We went to our local BOA loan officer and told him we wanted to refinance the loan with the current worth of the property. He said we needed to contact the bureau and contact the Attorney General 's office in order to refinance. We are asking for a loan modification with this property. We have paid Bank of America for 10 years and we owe more now than when we started further more the market has reset the worth of the property with a THREE year assessment that is XXXX LESS than our loan. We need immediate action on this loan. We have been excellent payers and have NOT been late on our payments but when this adjustable loan resets with current figures we will NOT be able to make the payments. Bank of America has made us go this route instead of helping us rest the loan to the real value of the property!
Mortgage,"Home loan paid off We paid our loan off in XX/XX/2019. 
Bank of America confirmed that the loan was paid in full. 
We sent instructions to Bank of America in writing to stop auto payments. 

Bank of America continues to withdraw payments, sending us a letter that the withdrawals are in error and then to refund the payments. 

I talked to Bank of America staff in XX/XX/2019 to request again that withdrawals stop. 

Bank of American continues the errors : XX/XX/XXXX refund of {$3500.00} for XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal made in error XXXX refund of {$3500.00} for XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal made in error XXXX refund of {$3500.00} for XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal made in error XX/XX/XXXX refund of {$3500.00} for XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal made in error Today I called again to request that Bank of America stop the withdrawals ; so far, no staff can assist me. 
I have called XXXX ( customer service ) ; XXXX ( mortgage ) ; XXXX ( online banking ) Please send me confirmation in writing that addresses the errors and confirms that no more withdrawals will be made in error."
Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX 2015 we closed on the sale of our house and Bank of America received the payoff on XXXX XXXX, 2015. At that time we had an escrow balance due of {$3800.00} +-. We have not received that payment and after XXXX phone calls to their customer service line we can still not get information on when we will be reimbursed. We have spoken to XXXX XXXX who assured we would receive our payment via usps by XXXX/XXXX/2015 and she would follow up with a call that day. She never called. Again we spoke to another representative, XXXX XXXX who said he would call us by XXXX/XXXX/2015. We have not heard from him either. It should be noted we were told the week of XXXX/XXXX/2015 the check was being sent XXXX and should have it XXXX/XXXX/2015. In none of these cases were we given a tracking number even though we asked. Note also that on the attached documents the escrow report shows a deduct from our account, we have not received that money."
Mortgage,"I've been charged with late fees, return fees, when I always paid punctually. I've been charged for homeowner 's insurance when I always paid my homeowner 's insurance separately and provided proof. I've made numerous attempts to resolve this charge and sent certified mail with proof of coverage. I've requested accounting ledger and found several misapplied mortgage payments which created late fees when I complained about it, they sent a {$20.00} check which I did not cash because it doesn't satisfy the fees added and their response was that it would mess up accounting and tax paperwork for every year. I also tried numerous times to seek assistance with my arm loan where my rate fluctuates every 6 months and explanation of why my interest rate would be higher than market rates when rates were low but high when it was high and although I've read my loan and verified, I have a no lower than 6.49 % rate I have sought assistance and getting fixed rate I have excellent credit and on fixed income but never defaulted on my loan nor my taxes but yet I was always instructed to refinance my loan and then get denied or do not qualify. I've been ignored I've been discriminated against due to my hearing loss from XXXX. They don't care to truly assist me."
Mortgage,"Bank of America 's Mortgage Servicing Department has put in place an automated phone system that does not work properly and as a result, not all of its borrowers can get access to help from a mortgage servicing representative. 

I have difficulties using automated voice response systems. Bank of America has made it impossible to speak to a representative without entering or giving identifying information to the AVR system first. This means that in order to speak to a representative, I have to have someone from my branch call in for me, which reduces my privacy and adds significant time. 

This requirement could be a problem for the elderly, XXXX or anyone who does not speak XXXX or XXXX ( there are no other language options ).
It makes it much too difficult for someone who needs help - a miscredited or lost payment, etc - to get the help that Bank of America is required to give.
In my case, we did get behind on our mortgage for one month but we BELIEVE we have caught it up. But there is an extra charge on our mortgage bill that we do n't understand and I have not been able to reach them to talk about it because I can not get through on the phone lines. 

I 'm not sure what Bank of America is legally required to do as a mortgage servicer but I do know that this is not a consumer-friendly way to deal with people who are dependent upon them for accurate, prompt and responsive service."
Mortgage,"Bank of America just filed a Notice of Default and is threatening foreclosure against my property for a HELOC. In XXXX of XXXX, my HELOC payments nearly tripled after paying on the loan for 10 years. I called Bank of America immediately to see I I could refinance. I was told I was not eligible. I made partial payments for a few months and then started the modification process. While I was in the modification process, they would not accept payments. The process went on for approximately five months. During that time, I faxed every piece of information they asked for, most multiple times. In the end, they denied me any type of modification, stating that I earn too much for some modifications and too little for other modifications ( I am a XXXX and single mother ). I tried offering a settlement, but that was also rejected. When I asked why it was rejected, I was told that it was based on the equity in my home. The Bank of America agent that I had been speaking with and faxing information to for months said that I owe {$160000.00} on my first and my home is valued at {$330000.00}. I could n't believe what I was hearing. I actually owe {$32000.00} on my first, and I had written that in numerous letters, and I had disclosed my mortgage statement with the payoff amount ( my loan has a {$15000.00} balloon payment ). I told her that, but I suspect the error was never corrected. Approximately two months later ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called B of A again to explain my situation and see if I could try the modification process. The agent suggested that I resubmit my offer. I did, but I never received a response. In XXXX, XXXX, I still had no response, so I contacted the Office of the President at B of A. I did receive a response promptly, but in the end, my offer was denied again and I was told that I had done all that I could. I did not think of it at the time, but now I suspect that Bank of America still has my first mortgage loan amount incorrect in their system. Shortly after that, I received an Intent to Accelerate Foreclosure letter. There was n't much that I could do. I could not afford to get caught up and make the monthly payments.On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a Debt Verification from XXXX XXXX XXXX, stating that B of A had instructed them to commence foreclosure proceedings on my property. The letter also stated that I had 30 days to dispute the validity of the debt. Two weeks later, I sent XXXX a certified letter and a standard mail letter stating that I wanted evidence of the legitimacy of their company and the original loan docs. They ignored my request. On XXXX XXXX, I received a copy of the Notice of Default they filed with XXXX XXXX. 
My first mortgage is with XXXX, and I am current on that loan. I spoke with a foreclosure specialist at XXXX just two days ago. She said that it does n't make any sense for B of A to foreclose, but that they do have the right to, and that they very well could go through with it. She suggested that I attempt to qualify for a Release of Lien through XXXX to be safe. I am considering that route, but I would much rather keep my home. After 13 years of owning my house, it is worth less than when I bought it, and it is still underwater. It is my home, though. I live in it with my XXXX kids that are now in college and connect afford to go to school and live on there own. It would be a tremendous hardship to give it up. I would greatly appreciate some assistance."
Mortgage,"I applied for a line of credit loan with Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Every time I contact hen for a status, I am told that my file is still unassigned. And I am told that it may take 6-10 business days for it to b assigned to a processor. Today I called and spoke to a supervisor, she tell 's me that it will be 15 days for my loan application to be assigned to a processor and that if everything is approved can expect to receive the loan in XXXX. They have all my paperwork and thy have run a credit check. If I had been informed that it would take 2 months, I would not have started this process with B of A, I would have shopped around for a more reasonable time to get the loan."
Mortgage,"I 'm writing to report an inconsistent, inaccurate and incredibly deceitful customer service practice relating to my mortgage account ( account number ending in XXXX ) with Bank of America. No address changes on any accounts should be made without documenting the conditions surrounding the address change."
Mortgage,"After reviewing all of BofA 's CFPB responses, you still have not answered ONE of my questions. All you or your staff has done is send copies upon copies of the same information since XXXX, XXXX. 

Mr. XXXX XXXX, you and your staff HAVE answered with accusations and non-truths. Since the CFPB does not allow the use of names, only initials, I did not appreciate Ms. XXXX answer in XXXX, XXXX. 

Ms. XXXX  had complete access to our Customer Service file. She could see who I spoke with and what was discussed. Based on her letter, it is clear she never researched anything. If she had, she would have realized to whom I spoke and the inaccuracies made by Bank of America. I have copies of our account profile indicating our preferences. THEY were and still are what I have said from the beginning. Ms. XXXX  was inaccurate and offensive. Representing BofA and you, possibly approach and self-control was in order. 

Instead, she chose to answer the complaint with no basis of fact. It was immensely unprofessional. Your office was supplied with Customer Service Reps initials, dates, times and subject. All she had to do was locate our file on her computer and conduct a little research. Then respond XXXX of XXXX ways ; BofA is sorry for what we did, we will try to better in the future. It cost you $ XXXX amount, let us credit your account. OR, she could have said, BofA is sorry for what happened. We have made a note in your file. It did not cost you anything, however, we will make sure it does not happen again.

NOPE, nothing like that. According to Ms. XXXX, it did not happen, I made it up! And, not only did I make it up, I had the nerve to file a complaint with the CFPB! Understand this right now, Ms. XXXX  owes me a written apology and a corrected the CFPB, Attorney General Office-State of FL and me. 

What she did is amateurish and petty and should never be allow to answer a complaint again. She puts enough truth in her lies to make them sound real and should be held accountable. 

THEREFORE, based on the fact you nor your office has given any true and accurate answers to the CFPD, I am going to spell each one out AGAIN, as if we have never spoken.

IN ADDITION, please do not think you will be able to answer with We are work with Mrs. XXXX and will take care of this matter and then close the complaint. I will continue to answer accurately and truthfully with correct documents and not 25 to 30 pages of my mortgage payment schedule.

That was the 1st ITEM.

The 2nd ITEM : Gift Card Scam. Mr. XXXX, I never, NOT once said or implied the gift cards were not purchased by me. What I did and have said ALL alone is Bank of America is accountable for us being caught in this scam for countless reasons. 

Bank of America was aware of this particular scam and American Banker, Cyber Security criminals sell hacker toolkits for BofA on the Dark-Web ; Security Breach XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ; XXXX, How to Use Your EDD Debit CardBank of America seems to be more concerned with making millions in fees than having over {>= $1,000,000} hacked from their bank ; The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX BofA reveals data breach of PPP application process ; and XXXX Security, Phishing Scam, Scams & Fraud : BofA : Phishing Scam Stealing Card Data, it is an email which appears to come from BofA to Confirm your Account, it looks exactly like BofAs website, after you put in your User ID and password, it takes you right to what you think is your account, that is right before the scammers drain every last XXXX you have! I have been with BofA for over 17 years and I have never heard about XXXX had to find it for myself. 

BofA has never notified their customers regarding this scam, so I attached a copy for your customers. 

And, Mrs. XXXX in charge of tech support ( customer service ) has approximately XXXX employees working from home due to covid-19 on a computer that everyone in their household has access, not to mention guests, or burglars ( hopefully not for their sake ).

Furthermore, this email supports my belief BofA was and still is out of compliance and accountable for what happens to their customers. Especially that particular weekend approximately 6 to 12 of your customers were deceived due to the Gift Card Scam. Which, by the way, was preventable on BofAs partthe email sent out a week later advising their customers of scams. 

In addition, Bank of America knew about the fraudulent phone numbers the scammers used. It has been on the internet for over 3 years. Have you or anyone in your department ever sent out an email? Advised the phone company? Tagged the phone number on the internet? I havent seen anything as of yet. 

After reading an article by XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, it made me realize a few things BofA is lacking. Therefore, I am paraphrasing here, but the article is well written and definitely worth reading. Here goes : Compliance lays the foundation to shape your companys reputation. Falter or hesitate your companys trust/reputation is shattered. Then your company is at risk of losing certain segments of your vendors, prospects and customers... not to mention how it will center on your ethical behavior. 
Failure to have compassion, protect yourself, your business and your customers is not only a great way to examples but keeps your company from fines, data breach and educate employees and customers on how to protect themselves against fraud and safety regulations which are designed to keep employees safe and hopefully make for a better work environment. 

The 3rd ITEM : The HELOC, which has never been answered. You and your staff have sent me no less than 10 copies of my loan history payment PLEASE do not send anymore.

Both you and your staff tell me there is no way to produce a Variable Interest Rate Mortgage Amortization Spreadsheet. Well, there isI found it on XXXX as a Template. 

Therefore, I produced a Variable Rate Mortgage Amortization Spreadsheet using your loan history and the interest rate Mr XXXX told me to use from the XXXX XXXX XXXX and it is attached. 

Then, I produced a XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX using the same interest rate, date of deposits and withdrawals of funds. 

As I compared the two ( 2 ) spreadsheets, it became apparent the ending balances do not match. They are close. However, looking at the BofA spreadsheet, I overpaid by approximately {$2500.00}. On my spreadsheet, the overpayment was about {$4200.00}. I know they are pretty accurate because BofA wrote off approximately {$20.00} to close out this HELOC. 

XXXX as, I have been asking for a current and updated amortization schedule and payoff since XX/XX/XXXX, I believe splitting the different is more than fair. The difference is {$850.00} + {$2500.00} for a total of {$3300.00}. 

I have left 3 messages on the voicemail extension provided on your letter and answered this letter a day or two ( 2 ) after receiptAND, I have still not heard from you.

Mr. XXXX, as Senior Resolution Specialist, you think it might be in everyones interest to honestly, finally and correctly answer the issues brought to your attention and finally and morally resolved. 

So far, all of the responses from BofA to CFPB and the Attorney Generals Office-State of FL yielded the accusation I was not truthful regarding any matters I provided."

Bank of America has decided for no valid reason that they will give us to cancel the short sale- This IS AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY ISSUED A SHORT SALE APPROVAL WITH US XXXX 

Bank of America has decided for no valid reason that they will give us to DELETE ALL the information we have previously provided to them - This is AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY ISSUED A SHORT SALE APPROVAL WITH US. 

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. No wonder Bank of America has received the most CFPB complaints since the creation of the CFPB in XXXX. XXXX does n't even have as many complaints as Bank of America, and XXXX does most of their servicing in third world countries with people that can barely speak English. 

It is pathetic that Bank of America has more complaints than a third-world servicer."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has had me in a Modification since XXXX. Not really getting no answers. Now they have given me a new server for the mortgage, with all fees attached and filed for a forclosure, and added more fees to accommodate that as well. We are so exhausted with this process. Please consider some type of help with this extremely long process and all the added fees which are thousands of dollars, in which we are already in a struggle. They have been so misleading since the forbearance has ended. They have changed their words, all help from the beginning and now won't even conversate with you. Bank of America has been a great disappointment to me and my wife in a very hurtful manner."
Mortgage,I had a mortgage with Bank of America and it was paid off XX/XX/2020. On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America deducted another mortgage payment in the amount of {$5300.00} for the month of XXXX for a loan that was paid off. I have called the bank and spoken to numerous representatives who have all assured me I would be getting my money back but here I am ( 21 days later ) and I still have not received my money back. I have simply asked that the funds be returned to the Bank of America checking account they took it from and I have received excuse after excuse. My average wait time to speak to a representative is a minimum of 2 hours and I've made at least 8 to 10 calls. I'm frustrated and I'm at my wits end. I have other obligations to meet and the bank taking these funds has placed me in a difficult situation. I would appreciate anything you can do. Thank you.
Mortgage,"I am asking for someone to please help me with Bank of America Home Loans. After my wife was bitten viciously by a dog, she lost her job and as a result we fell behind in mortgage payments. Bank of America has been making my family fight a fight that even when serving in the vietnam war, I would rather be back there than having to deal with the underhanded tactics of Bank of America. They have denied us a couple of times not because of our financials but because they claim we do not have the right paperwork but we are submitting all documents that are being requested of us by Bank of America. Furthermore, they had issue with my wife 's bank statements claiming that the letter head was incorrect. We provided bank statements directly from the bank, this is ludicrous. More recently, my wife submitted yet another package for modification and around XXXX XXXX, 2016, Bank of America agent XXXX XXXX confirmed we had a COMPLETE package and that they would be reviewing us. Further, she informed me that we would do the financial interview and that she would call me in the next couple of days. Well, low and behold two days later we get a Notice of Trustee Sale posted on our door. How can they tell us on the one hand that they have a complete package and that we are being reviewed for a loan modification and then try and sell my home. Bank of America is engaging in illegal dual tracking and they are in violation of the Homeowner Bill of Rights passed in California. I ask that someone kindly monitor my review process so that I am given a fair chance at modification. I served my country in XXXX and I was XXXX XXXX. I have been through so much and Bank of America is completely stripping me of all of my pride, as I can not fight this battle in a fair manner. I am working full time, my wife will be receiving her XXXX and my kids help us out. I want to start paying Bank of America a mortgage payment I am not trying to live for free. I beg you please help me to get a fair review for a modification."
Mortgage,I used to have a loan with Bank of America and in my credit report still showing I own them money!!! And I have right now the same loan but with a different company
Mortgage,"I am writing as there was an error made by the mortgage company in accurately reflecting my payments. The inaccurate recording of this payment has caused negative marks on my credit report as well as lost money in  my Home Affordability Modification. As part of this modification you are to make your house payments on time every month and then you are forgiven {$1000.00} for the first 5 years and {$5000.00} in the sixth year. I have tried to work this out directly with the mortgage companies, through my Senator (   XXXX   XXXX , worked with  XXXX   XXXX  in his office in  XX/XX/XXXX  ) and Congressman for the last 7 years but there has been little resolve.  <P/> Back in  XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for th e Home Affordability Modification . In  XX/XX/XXXX  I received a bonus at work and I decided to pay my house payment early on  XX/XX/XXXX  for  XX/XX/XXXX . On XX/XX/XXXX  Bank of Americ a ( BO A ) purchased my  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  and the payment I made  XX/XX/XXXX  was not counted as my  XX/XX/XXXX  house payment, instead it was counted as a principle payment without my approval. I received my first house statement in  XX/XX/XXXX  stating that I was already a month behind with BOA. I immediately called and spoke with a representative that said, Not to worry about it that the  XXXX  mortgage companies would work it out and it would just take a couple of months but this would not impact my credit since I already paid the other company. I continued to make my monthly payments on time and after two months I still noticed that my bill was stating that I was late. I proceeded to call BOA again and ask the status of my first inquiry since I was told it would be worked out. They had no notes of this conversation and stated that I was a month behind and needed to pay the bill. I explained that I could document the payment and I would like to send them this information for them to correct my account. They gave me the fax number for their research department and told me that they would look into it.  <P/> I proceeded to call BOA every month and spend hours on the phone. On  XX/XX/XXXX  at  XXXX  I spoke with  XXXX  and she told me, That she had found the error and escrow will go down and lower your principle payment and if you pay an additional {$88.00} this time then we will be able to correct your payment and take care of this. I paid this money and yet the issue was not resolved. Other times I called in I was told the same thing but then it was that I needed to pay {$25.00} more dollars or $ 30+. I paid these payments as I just wanted things to be done.  <P/> On another occasion I was on the phone with BOA going through the issue AGAIN and there was a disheveled man that came to my door with a torn edge from a piece of paper that had BOAs phone number on it. He stated,  BOA is wanti ng their money and they have tried to call you with no return phone calls. You need to call them back at this phone number. I told him that I was on the phone with them right now and then I told the lady on the phone what had just happened. She stated We would never send anyone out like that. I explained that he told me that it was from your corporation and provided me your  XXXX  number to call you. This made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe in my own home, as a single mother with a daughter, that a bank would be giving out my information to a man who looked like he was a bounty hunter.  <P/> I also faxed the attached paperwork on more than  8 o ccasions to their research department which I was then told by one of the researchers,  XXXX   XXXX , on  XX/XX/XXXX  at  XXXX , that he discovered the issue and the payment was recorded as a principle payment but he was no longer working on this project. He let me know that I needed to AGAIN fax all of the paperwork into them and he told me what to include on the fax cover sheet so that they could correct the issue. I did this and it still went uncorrected. I have documentation that states the dates, times, and people I spoke with each time I called in and can produce this if you need. I started tracking this after some time as nothing was ever being done when I had called in countless times and spent hours on the phone trying to get this corrected. Finally in the end BOA stated there was nothing they could do and I just needed to pay the money.  <P/> In  XX/XX/XXXX  my mortgage was sold to   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   (  XXXX  ) the same thing started over with  XXXX  as they were told from BOA that I was late on my payments. I started to call them and fax them my documentation  on 5 sepa rate occasions before they as well sold my mortgage off to a fourth company.   In  XX/XX/XXXX  my loan was sold to  XXXX   XXXX  from  XXXX  and the same thing started over with  XXXX  as they were told from  XXXX  that I was late on my payments. I started to call them and fax them my documentation on  3 sep arate occasions before finally in  XX/XX/XXXX  their research department found and corrected the issue to reflect that my house payments have been made on time for only the time they owned the loan. I explained to them that they needed to write the  XXXX  credit bureaus and tell them to correct my full payment history with all mortgage companies since they were able to find the mistake. I also stated that I would like a copy of the three letters that they send so that I have this for my records. They told me they would do this and yet I never received any of these letters and my credit report was never updated.  <P/> As of this date,  XX/XX/XXXX  my credit report has not been corrected by any of these mortgage companies, I have not received the missing extra dollars of forgiveness from my Home Affordability Modification and I have also paid {$1700.00} more throughout the years above my Home Affordability Modification Agreement. Not to mention the thousands of hours I have spent over the past 7 years trying to get this corrected with these  XXXX  mortgage companies.  <P/> My concern is Bank  of Americas  banking practices as they moved money around my account a lot during the time they had my loan. As well as where did all of the extra little payments that I made to them go? I know they have been in trouble in the past due to their accounting practices and I am now a victim to this as well and I would like resolution. Even in a letter to me from their CEOs office it stated, As a member of the credit reporting community, Bank of America has an obligation to report your account payment history accurately, whether it is favorable or unfavorable. We have confirmed that we did not receive payments from you on the account for the  XX/XX/XXXX  through  XX/XX/XXXX , also  XX/XX/XXXX  through  XX/XX/XXXX  and  XX/XX/XXXX  through  XX/XX/XXXX  installments, and Bank of America reported such data accordingly. This is very concerning considering all of my bank statements prove that I made all of these payments so I am not sure how true they are following their obligation to accurately record my payments.  <P/> My resolution would be to have my credit report updated to accurately reflect that over the last 7 years I have not made any late payments ov er 30+ days, I would like the extra money in forgiveness from the Home Affordability Modification, and I would also lik e the extra {$1700.00} reflected as a principle payment to my home loan. Last, I would like some sort of payment for all of the hours I have spent trying to correct an issue that was not mine to begin with and some sort of retribution to happen to BOA for their banking errors. Personally, I feel that I should have my house paid off due to all of the hours I spent on the phone with these companies, hours of putting documentation together, taking days off work to handle these calls, as well as faxing and mailing this information multiple times to them, and just the overall stress this has caused in my life. Why should I the customer be punished for paying a bank my house payment early? I am a woman who works multiple jobs and thought I was doing the right thing by paying my house payment early and yet I have now been punished for this good decision for 7 years. If anything this has taught me I would rather pay late then early as this is the only way it will be accurately recorded.  <P/> I have attached a spreadsheet that details out every payment sinc e  XX/XX/XXXX  whe n the modification went into effect, along with all of the bank statements to match each payment, the payment history from BOA,  XXXX  and  XXXX , and last my Home Affordability Modification Agreement. I wanted to attach this so that you have all of the evidence for your review to back up my complaint in this letter. If you would like all of the paperwork documenting all of my calls with the names, times, and dates that I called these companies I would be happy to provide this information.  <P/> Thank you for your time and review,  XXXX   XXXX"
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,2007 Closed of Home /Predatory Lending I was and still am XXXX XXXX. I was collecting XXXX and still am. i closed on a property for XXXX with XXXX down. No job, No chance of getting better. Everywhere i contact say there nothing you can do?"
Mortgage,Refinanced a home equity from BOA into a mortgage at XXXX. During the closing we provided all the correct information to XXXX -- at payoff XXXX tried to pay off the home equity with a wire which BOA was not willing to accept so they over night the check to BOA with the correct address. The tracking number indicated that they received it on XX/XX/XXXX. We have called BOA everyday trying to figure out why the payment and payoff was not completed. Customer service kept us on hold for over 90 + minutes. I then called their 800 number to lodge a complaint and was told they could not do anything. So I find myself not being able to complete a complaint ; speaks to the Presidents office and they could not help me. I spoke to XXXX in customer service and a supervisor XXXX XXXX - he asked to transfer me 3 or 4 times to be on hold for 90+ minutes again and all I asked was for a formal complaint to be registered. I have spent over 5 hours trying to talk to someone at BOA to repair this situation and payoff the home equity and it is still not resolved. I am not even sure if they did file a complaint because I have not evidence of this nor did he tell me someone would take care of it. This is unacceptable and feel this is not the manner any bank should operate. This is unacceptable and they have way too many excuses especially for a system conversion that does not have a business continuity plan for instances like the above.
Mortgage,"Reference initial complaint XXXX Bank of America transferred mortgage to XXXX for servicing to foreclosure ( BofA, XXXX. miss answered the initial complaint which was supported with documents into record ). A debt collector law firm, XXXX, has been attached and have begun complete foreclosure without validating debt. We went to BofA on XX/XX/2012 turned in Death Certificate, Letters of Administration, Will & Deed of Trust as well as opened a bank account, closed the deceased account where payments were being deducted from and transferred deduction to new account. We began making payments as they were posted and BofA accepted until we kept asking for the loan to be transferred into the name of the owner of the property, clarify why the loan numbers did not matched so that we may properly address because there appears to have been tampering and a disappearance of residual assets belonging to the estate and to pay debts. Subsequently after numerous attempts to get a response to our Qualified Written Request a foreclosure has begun and it appears by the most recent document filed by XXXX, debt collector, who has refused to address or provide why the loan numbers do not match has filed a Protective Order against the home owner for asking them to follow the law and guidelines associated with debt collection practices. While our home is being jepoardized, in our initial complaint we brought it to your attention as while there was money in our bank to cover the mortgage, savings over draft protection, BofA was refusing payments and transferred the mortgage without validation or response as requested and promised. 
Because our home is attached to this, there is a clear disregard for our legitimate request. We have sought legal representation to defend the foreclosure however many questions are being raised without answers. 
It seems extremely concerning that the debt collector has filed an Order of Protection while they unlawfully aggressively pursue foreclosure. Protection Ordeds are for victims, which is what we feel like at this point however it appears the rules do not matter to another large entity. 
This matter needs to be brought to the attention of any and all governing agencies as if the loan numbers do not match the debt collector is withholding information that is relevant to all parties, not just them. Hiding behind they are protecting their client further raises issues when our property is being attached and a foreclosure is actively being pursued. 
We will continue to reach out for assistance because we are unlawfully being harmed as a result of unknown actions we have sought to address. The response letter dated XX/XX/2012 received indicated, Adjustable Rate Note ( adjustable crossed out ) and, "" Unfortunately, we are unable to provide you with the following Loan Documents you requested : Other : is not available because the document "" the answer was wited out. We have gotten the run around ever since. We made this request in person with the branch manager in XXXX, MD. XXXX, the debt collector now has indicated they are protecting their client and that we are not entitled to the information. I am the homeowner, deed of trust on record, personal administrator as well as heir to the estate - who is the client? Why am I not entitled to see and know why the loan numbers do not match and whose names are present?"
Mortgage,"I bought my residential property in XXXX with a mortgage, hazard/wind insurance and flood insurance on the entire property. In XXXX I took out a home equity loan with Bank of America, also on the entire property. XXXX insurance has always provided the flood insurance, though the agents servicing the loan have changed over the years. In XXXX, XXXX my local XXXX agent abruptly left the company. My flood insurance was due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I could not pay it because my local agent had left XXXX and the new agent could not access the database containing my records.As soon as he could get into the records, he called me. I gave him my credit card payment over the phone. He verified the mortgagors on the account, including the Bank of America. He said he would notify both and he did. However, I got a letter from Bank of America saying my policy was "" cancelled or expired and acceptable evidence of coverage was required. '' I sent a copy of my declaration page. I got a second letter with the same wording. I sent a second copy of the declaration page. No other response. I noticed a fee of {$1100.00} had been charged to my HELOC account when I was reviewing documents in connection with a loan modification I was requesting. When I called Bank of America about it, I was told the charge was for a separate structure that I added to my property that had to be covered by a separate policy. I explained that no structure had been added and asked to talk to a supervisor. The supervisor informed me that the flood policy was not even on a residential property and that the insurance requirement was different. I called my ( new ) insurance agent who assured me that the policy was indeed residential and that nothing in or on the declaration page said otherwise and that everything was still covered. I have been going back and forth with different employees of the Bank of America. Every time I talk to one of them they come up with a different explanation for why this duplicate insurance on my property has been force placed. It is a single property with several buildings that I bought in XXXX. It has been taxed and insured as a single property since then. A permitted shed was added in XXXX and both insurance companies ( XXXX XXXX for hazard/wind and XXXX for flood ) were notified with no problem. The same insurance remains in place since before the HELOC was initiated in XXXX. 

The property is not two separate properties. They are attached by structure, utilities and a single septic tank. I rent part of my property for vacationers and must keep a separate address for the county so they can get mail and so I can pay tax on the rent. but no structures have been added. The same loan with the same provisions has remained in place, but I now have force placed, extremely expensive, DUPLICATE flood insurance policy on my property. Please note, THERE HAS BEEN NO PROBLEM WITH THE PRIMARY MORTGAGOR OR WITH THE HAZARD/WIND POLICY on the same property. 
This duplicate insurance fee needs to be removed back to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX but I can not get relief from the many Bank of America representatives I have talked to over the last several months.,"
Mortgage,"I filed complaint # XXXX about BANK OF AMERICA HOME LOAN and received an email today from CFPB that BOA can not respond to the complaint because I never submitted 3rd party  authorization. I submitted twice. Once by fax the other by direct email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, @ XXXX XXXX along with additional documentation that was requested of me. I have been talking to XXXX XXXX and he has never told me that he never had it. He called me today and didn't leave me a message. He told me yesterday he would have a reply for me this week and now I see this from your offices. 

I am filing this complaint to address them not processing the modification request sent to them on XX/XX/XXXX and I am filing this complaint against Bank of America saying that I didn't submit a 3rd party letter authorizing them to speak to XXXX XXXX from XXXX  XXXX XXXX  who is a HUD counselor who is helping to assist me with the loan modification. BOA is running out my time so that this house will be sold without them dealing with the modification request. They keep asking for documents and every time I give them something they ask for more. I have proven there are funds to cover the modification but they won't accept or deny it nor will they offer any other options and this is what this company does by using up time to cause people further debt. I need help getting them to process the paperwork and not sale the house because they refused to acknowledge they dropped the ball and didn't process the paperwork submitted to them on XX/XX/XXXX."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau I have a complaint in regards to my house placed under foreclosure through my mortgage company Bank of America. My house was paid off in XXXX. Bank of America failed to notify me with the Deed of release. I continued making payments on all the way up until XXXX, when I received a letter with a returned money order stating that I over paid. I then was notified that my house was paid. I have been under bankruptcy twice since XXXX. My payments consistently increased. A couple years back I was under foreclosure where I came across a program that I applied for to help me to stay in my home. I later found out that BOA took the payments from me that I continue making and also taking the payments from the program and lied about the program saying that I was denied. A couple of weeks ago, a XXXX looking man came to my house, knocked on my door, and told me that he has purchased my house. My house was listed on a website called XXXX After the house "" sold '' at the auction that was listed on the website. Most of my family members, and members through marriage all received a letter from a lawyer in XXXX, TN letting each person know that my house was under foreclosure, how much it sold for, & the date. The letter also stated that there is an overage or refund that it is owed to me. This has been a stressful, embarrassing time for me. I have paid my house two to three times more that what I should have. While I was under bankruptcy the lawyer for BOA asked that I pay for their fee and the bankruptcy trustee agreed. My house was paid off in XXXX. It is now XXXX. That mean, I overpaid my house for 9 years! and BOA continue to let me while taking my money. I have received a court date for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX for Possession of my home. 

This has to be corrected for my children and I. This needs to corrected now so that my children and grandchildren can inherit what I have worked, and struggle so many years for. This house need, must, and will be inherited to my family not to a thief that think that they can come and steal what is rightful OURS. I'm consistently receiving calls, texts, emails, and flyers in the mail asking me to sale my home. My home, that me and my family has built together and made it our own??? My home were there are so many memories in??? BOA has stolen and lied to so many homeowners over the years and I'm one of them. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed immediately. I need answers fast."
Mortgage,"My spouse and I are the first-time homebuyers. We applied to Bank of America for a Home loan Mortgage. Both of us are Bank of America clients since XX/XX/XXXX. The loan officer and bank did not inform us about not providing the loan estimate until 7 days after our application. We were rushed through the credit pull thus locking us in but were kept on hold whenever we are some clarity regarding the loan estimates. The bank executives are not transparent to the customers upfront and make them lose 2-3 weeks of time in an aggressive market. They changed their policy overnight to no longer provide loan estimates until we go under contract with a home purchase offer. This makes it very risky for us since lock ourselves with their loan application. 
This action has not only led to miscommunication, mistrust but also has caused us stress. 
I request CFBP to compel Bank of America to carry out more transparent practices."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America Loan # XXXX When Bank of America was the servicer that told me untrue and incorrect information and then later tried to take my home. This has caused me to lose the 2 % HAMP modification that I previously had. See attachment for details. 
Bank of America clearly misled me."
Mortgage,"Me and my wife worked to pay down our conventional 30 mortgage with Bank of America to get below an 80 % LTV so that we could cancel PMI. Once we reached below 80 %, I contacted Bank of America to inquire about PMI cancellation. The representative informed me that our loan to value ratio did indeed qualify for cancellation of PMI. He told me that he submitted the request and to allow up to 4 weeks to get a letter indicating approval and conformation of cancellation of PMI. I asked if there was any reason that the request would not get approved. He said it will get approved as long as long as there where no late payments in the last 24 months ( there where no late payments for the entire loan period ). A couple weeks later, I get a letter from Bank of America stating that my request for cancellation of PMI was denied because the current LTV ratio of my loan has not met the established requirements to summit a request to cancel PMI. They also attached a form with with instructions to use there appraiser to pay for a new appraisal if the current value came back at less than 75 % LTV. Looking around at other complaints on Bank of America, It appears to me that this is standard practice for them when it comes to people canceling PMI."
Mortgage,"I went over a loan modification back in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. My mortgage company during the modification period was XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I went trough trial periods with monthly payments that included interest & escrow. Below a sequence of event chronology. For payment reference, pages 14 to 21 of the attached BOA mortgage statement.

Mortgage,"The principal balance of my HELOC was "" forgiven '' by Bank of America, as result of the Department of Justice and XXXX XXXX XXXX global settlement with major mortgage servicers in 2012. Per the forgiveness agreement with B of A ( copy attached ), the bank was to "" report to the major credit bureaus that your account was paid and closed. "". Contrary to our forgiveness agreement, B of A has reported the account as a charge off ( copy of XXXX Report attached ). My communication with the bank has not been successful in getting them to correctly report to credit bureaus."
Mortgage,"I have REPEATEDLY complained that Bank of America has not sent me a mortgage statement in, now, 3 years. They constantly confirm the coorect mailing address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX and insist that they are mailing the statements there, but I continue to not receive them. I have no idea what the monthly payment is or if it has changed. They also continue to post late fees for what was THEIR error in XXXX taking my mortgage payment and applying it to a credit card instead of the mortgage then threatening me with destroying my credit and foreclosure."
Mortgage,"I have filed multiple complaints on this issue, all of them were closed saying they were duplicate. Please DO NOT close this complaint as no other complaint is open right now, and there has been no response or resolution from Bank of America. 

About the end of XX/XX/2021, I applied for a refinance with the Bank of America ( BoA ) for our current mortgage ( outstanding balance of about $ 1.9M ) and loan application # XXXX. The existing mortgage on this home is also from BoA. The bank charged us an appraisal fee of {$1700.00} for conducting two independent appraisals for our home but confirmed that the appraisal fee would be credited back to us at the time of closing. The refinance process moved very slowly and while the bank was still crawling forward with the process, in the first week of XX/XX/2021, we were offered a cash out refinance at very attractive terms by the same BoA sales manager, XXXX XXXX, who we were working with. We liked the idea as we had long wanted to do home improvements and this cash out could put money in our pocket to redo our kitchen, etc. We decided to change our refinance to a cash out refinance. We reviewed our options with a trusted realtor and he advised that the improvements we were planning would significantly improve the value of the home. We communicated this to our loan processor, and duly followed every step from there on. Every document that BOA asked for was provided in a timely fashion. The fresh appraisal that was conducted as part of the cash out refinance also confirmed that we had over $ XXXX  ( over 50 % ) in equity in the house. My income level clearly supported the cash out refinance that we applied for, which BoA duly confirmed with pay stubs, tax statements, stock grants, etc. However, in XX/XX/2021 during this cash out process, a number of unreasonable, confusing and unethical actions were taken by BoA, which had us frustrated and concerned : 1. The interest rate for the cash out, which was promised to us to be the same as a rate and term refinance as recently as XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX at 1.875 %, was suddenly raised by 0.5 % pts in the closing disclosure sent in early XXXX We raised our concerns with XXXX  and his manager but they reverted that the rates were different as higher as the cash out process was updated by underwriting, separately from the sales team, for a higher rate. The sales team, while it had promised a lower rate, could not influence underwriting.. strange for us as we thought we were working with a national level bank and not separate groups within it. However, we decided to move forward in the interest of closing our process and moving on with our lives. 2. In late XX/XX/2021, XXXX was preparing us for the closing on a call as everything was getting ready for a closing. He casually asked us for proof of $ XXXX  in assets to get the cash out. He said we could do a smaller cash out only if we did not have $ XXXX  but 'just ' $ XXXX  in assets- which was still XXXX  MORE than the cash out of $ XXXX we were seeking!! If we didn't have even $ XXXX  then they might not be able to do a cash out! We were very upset about this last minute and casual blow. We asked the reason for this unreasonable ask as the collateral for the mortgage was the house and my income. We questioned why our assets were needed but we weren't given any satisfactory answers. XXXX XXXX also did a lot of communication with texts and not through secure BoA channels. I succumbed to the ask again and sent all our asset statements to BoA which satisfied their $ XXXX  in ask! I sent statements as asked for for the current and prior months but they continued to play more games. Then XXXX XXXX applied random 'risk ' percentages to our assets stating only 60 % of stock assets could be counted, etc. We were losing patience with these unwritten and seemingly last minute 'policies ' crafted specifically for our situation. We just wanted to close, get the money and rate they were now offering us and be done. 3. Unreasonable loan policies for cash out refinance were disclosed to us, e.g. varying loan to value based on the value of our asset base 4. Random percentages were assigned to calculate how much of our asset base would be considered for the loan to value calculation 5. All these random asks and communication from XXXX XXXX, his manager and BoA underwriting weren't through the secure portal on BoA where we were sending them our loan documents but through personal texts, unsecured emails etc. On XX/XX/XXXX, suddenly, with no clear explanation, our cash out refinance was completely rejected by BoA. On repeated questioning, the reason given to us was a very broad saying that the home improvements we wanted to make would be "" Material alterations to the subject property ''. This makes no sense at all, as BoA has no way to determine what's a material change v/s what's not. They asked us to take a construction loan on the property instead which has a very high interest rate. Per the BoA appraisal we have over 50 % equity in the house but the bank will not let us cash out our equity based on lame excuses. Instead they want to push to us new money at a much higher interest rate. They have also refused to return to us the appraisal fee that we already paid for. In the end, we have wasted umpteen number of hours to provide BoA every single piece of document they asked for and were satisfied with, have lost the fee we have paid, and of course, don't have the money we were promised by the bank to make the improvements to our home. We feel we were harassed and our trust was exploited to reveal personal financial information unrelated to our mortgage. The bank never wanted to give us the cash out which they would have to any other family with similar financial and professional credentials. And we believe BoA has given families, even in our neighborhood, cash out loans on their homes for home improvements, and WITHOUT asking for proof of assets separate from the home itself. We believe our family was discriminated against and exploited for our cultural and ethnic diversity. What we are requesting is a complete review of our family 's treatment in this mortgage process against the federal set standards. If BoA has given a cash out refinance to any family in the USA for home improvements, or if BoA did not ask for a proof of $ XXXX  in risk adjusted assets for a $ XXXX  of cash out from another American family, or if BoA did not change the mortgage rate offered to a family after a closing disclosure was given to them, then they have used unfair practices to discriminate with our family. And if discrimination can be identified here then the bank should be heavily fined and punished for their conduct. We are also then asking for our appraisal money to be fully refunded and we be given our loan with due respect."

Mortgage,"I was doing refi on our home last week. As part of the process we had to pay off the XXXX held by Bank of America for over XXXX years. I tried reaching out to them and was told that I had to contact their appropriate department which I think was located in XXXX. I spent about an hour on the phone, was passed around, and got nowhere. I decided that I would not have an opportunity to pay off the loan myself, so I expected it to be included in the XXXX documents. On XXXX XXXX the escrow XXXX said that she had been given a payout amount of {$65000.00}. On XXXX XXXX, the closing date, she received a new payout amount of {>= $1,000,000} with no explanation. She was able to refinance the first mortgage, preventing a foreclosure sale, but she was given no explanation for the huge amount demanded by BofA to pay off the XXXX. After numerous calls it was revealed to her that Bank of America was demanding payment for both their second mortgage plus the much larger XXXX XXXX. This information was never communicated to me. She said that she couldn't close the XXXX  without a proper accounting from XXXX, something that they refused to give. I was supposed to receive {$75000.00} cash out. I need the money. She asked me to call BAC. I spent XXXX hours on the phone last Friday, XXXX XXXX. I was passed around from XXXX XXXX department after another -- -foreclosure, consumer credit, and others. These various departments were located in far away locations throughout XXXX -- -- I started in XXXX, was transferred XXXX, then XXXX XXXX, then XXXX, I was to be transferred to XXXX when I just gave up. At no point in this long telephonic journey did I encounter anybody who was even close to understanding the problem ; it was always the problem of another department in another city, and each step of the way required long waits on hold, re-identification of me and my loan. 

The XXXX XXXX told me that she started in again on Tuesday and logged an hour and a half holding and talking before finding a XXXX employee who would clearly identify the problem. This person told her that they would not give her the opportunity to pay off the XXXX until they, giant BAC, had received back their check for {$1.00} XXXX which they submitted as a bid on my home in foreclosure. She said that 'maybe ' it would be returned by XX/XX/XXXX. I have a couple of questions : Why can't BAC just put a stop payment on the check? That would end their liability. Why can't BAC just have someone in their giant organization straightforwardly explain what they are doing? Why didn't they simply inform the XXXX  officer that they were going enter the bidding on my house instead of giving her a valid payoff amount, and then, at the last minute, bumping that amount by XXXX XXXX? Why should I be punished because they failed in their attempt to exploit my situation by bidding on the sale which didn't happen? Why is there no penalty for BAC for behaving so badly? They have wasted so far about a day of my time and probably half a day of the escrow XXXX 's time. I will start in again tomorrow with a new BAC XXXX number. I am not optimistic because these calls have not worked in the past, but I have no other alternative. I have had a BAC account for over XXXX years. It means nothing to them. I am just another victim to be fleeced. I went to my local branch seeking help, and after waiting, was informed that I would have to call another XXXX number... .which leads to a XXXX zone of ignorance and indifference. These big banks make billions in profits. They pay their CEOs XXXX to XXXX ; why don't you compel them to provide some decent public service. The federal government is always there to bail them out and to keep the vast salaries high while small business people ( me ) go to the wall. 

Make these guys provide people who will answer the phone and respond to their customers promptly in a meaningful way. 

Thank you."
Mortgage,Received letter from Bank of America XXXX XXXX says case XXXX said she was my direct contact except Did not include phone number location Tried calling return address was bounced all over country Last person said XXXX XXXX took over case. Will call me back. NO ONE has ever called me back Including numerous numbers different parts of country Only crooks go to this extreme to cover up forging FHA mortgages.
Mortgage,"In XXXX, we found out that we have a crumbling foundation and notified the bank/mortgage company ( i.e. Bank of America ) with the hope that they would help us in the process. We stopped payment because we were not going to be able to afford fixing the foundation and make mortgage payments. 

We applied for a modification in early XXXX. During that time period of complete shut down from the pandemic, it took XXXX  months to hear back from the bank while interest accrued. We were offered a trial payment modification program and made the 3 payments on time. I lost my job in XXXX and left another job due to unsafe conditions in XXXX. My unemployment was held up for 3-4 months and my husband 's hours were reduced. We were not able to make the XXXX payment to complete the modification program which then expired. 

We reapplied for a modification in XX/XX/XXXX, this application was received and confirmed by BOA. I followed up several times during the 6 months but that application disappeared. After many calls talking with different people, we applied for a third time in XXXX XXXX. Again, it took over 6 months to hear back from the bank. They offered $ XXXX over a 14 year period starting in XXXX. This would not be sustainable based on our annual household income. 

We contacted the Connecticut Housing Authority and spoke with XXXX XXXX who got in touch with XXXX XXXX, customer service, from BOA. They were going to appeal this decision and advised us not to make the payment until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX said that we could make the payment over the phone and when we tried, we were told that we could only mail it because our account is in suspension. I would have sent it overnight but there is only a po box so I had to mail it.

BOA called and informed us that the payment was late and that the trial is null and void. I explained to the woman on the phone that we were advised by their own person and the HUD representative to mail on XX/XX/XXXX and that the postmark before XX/XX/XXXX was ok. 

Over the past few years, we have attempted to make payments online, over the phone or in person at a BOA branch, but the bank will not allow us to do this as interest continues to accrue. We are in a never ending circle, talking with different representatives who have different answers and suggestions along the way. We just wanted to get back to making our payments and we have continually been blocked. This is insane. 

To top this off, we are scheduled to get our house lifted and fixed starting XX/XX/XXXX and BOA is not working with us. We'll need to spend an additional $ XXXX to complete the repairs and we don't even know what the bank is going to do. 

Help us please."
Mortgage,Bank of America lost payments Changed Account # s and Charged Bogus Late Fees
Mortgage,"During Covid, XXXX XXXX offered mortgage relief ( I have two loans for two houses, XXXX XXXX was awesome, Bank of America was horrible, and my new loan servicer for the BofA loan is good ). I did not have to pay on my mortgages until they told me to. Then the loan servicers forwarded an offer from XXXX XXXX to modify my loans, to include the extra accumlated from Covid ( interest, taxes and interest ). Which I accepted. 

Bank of America "" loan servicing dept '' called me three days a week during the time to make sure everything was following XXXX XXXX rules. On XX/XX/2022, I completed the requirements for the loan modification. I was ordered to stand down by BofA loan servicers until further notice. That loan servicing corporation was now responsible for my loan. 

Meanwhile, the Bank of America forclosure department started sending demand letters that were alien to the XXXX XXXX contractual offer. 
Then AFTER bank of america no longer had any legal authority on the loan. The forclosure department was trying to shake me down for {$45000.00} in "" arrears ''. 
Then the foreclosure department reported me to credit reporting agencies in XXXX as being 120 days in arrears in XXXX. When they had no legal authority on the loan for several months, thus no legal ability to make the report. Thus taking my credit score down to XXXX. 
This will affect my employability, my current loans and other critical aspects of life"
Mortgage,"My sister and I recently purchased a house and we were pre-approved by XXXX XXXX with Bank of America for up to {$380000.00}. Working with XXXX was challenging as he repeatedly asked for information that we had already submitted to him. His poor time management and unorganized behavior were inconvenient and irritating, but that is not our complaint. Our real complaint is that he attempted to mislead us and have us sign new paperwork for our loan on the Friday before our Monday closing date. Our closing date was set for XXXX XXXX, 2016, but on Friday XXXX XXXX XXXX called my sister and told her he needed her to e-sign some additional paperwork immediately. She asked why and he indicated it was something he had forgotten to have her sign. He even offer to meet her at our residence to have her sign all the new forms. What he did not explain was that he had removed my name from the loan and was going to issue the loan solely in my sisters name. We obviously both wanted to be on the loan as we were purchasing the house together. He later called me to tell me that I did not have enough traditional forms of credit for him to approve me on the loan, but after he pursued my sister and attempted to get her to sign on a new loan. It was not his fault that the underwriter did not want to approve me, however he waited until 1 business day before our closing date to inform us of this and he tried to convince my sister to sign paperwork for the loan without explaining what the paperwork was. He also had pre-approved us for up to {$38000.00} based on our credit scores, income, and debt to income ratio, but the housed we were purchasing was only {$170000.00}. We would have selected a different mortgage company immediately had we known there would be any issues having both of us approved on the loan. We were forced to drop him and Bank of America and were financed through a different company with no issue. However, it caused our closing date to be pushed back almost an entire month and we had already paid for an appraisal with Bank of America that was not refundable. It was a waste of our time and money and we were misled by a loan officer that was more concerned about getting his compensation for the loan than he was providing us honest information."
Mortgage,"I have been working with Bank of America since-XX/XX/XXXX on my Client for a Short Sale Approval.  Which BTW was approved once on XX/XX/XXXX with a previous Buyer. I have repeatedly called and emailed my Negotiator to only go 5 to 7 days without ever receiving a response. Numerous calls have been made to BOA Customer Service to request the file get expedited to a Supervisor. It's now been 10 days with no returned call from my Negotiator and or the Supervisor. I placed BOA on notice the urgency of getting their response due to the 1st Lien holder 's approval will expire on XX/XX/XXXX, which would cause me to re-start this all over after working the file with both Lender 's involved since XX/XX/XXXX. As I mentioned I left the Supervisor 4-5 messages over the last 5 business days, to only have someone from Customer Service call me to say they would email the Supervisor to contact me. This has been an absolutely horrifying experience with BOA. I have worked this part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX for well over 30 years, and the communications with BOA have never changed or improved at any positive level. As of today I was told my Negotiate is out of the office and has been for the entire week, and there is NO ONE overseeing her position while she is away, and NO ONE can assist to move the file for final review until the Negotiator returns. This is only a small portion of the chain of events with BOA. I would very much like to understand why if an employee is out of the office there is not one person available to respond with some knowledge that the file is being worked on. My file has now been sitting idle for well over 10 business days. If I performed business in this manner I would be out of business. I have throughout this entire process with BOA responded to their request the same day there is NO reason this file should not have been completed in a timely fashion, but due to the inability of the individuals that are holding this file idle have made this an impossible to feel there is an end and a hope for those being affected financially by this chain of events."
Mortgage,"My name on the mortgage is XXXX XXXX, but my name is XXXX XXXX now. 

I was denied a home modification in XX/XX/XXXX, because I had previously received a modification. I'm working full time now and can afford to pay the mortgage. I spoke with my Bank of America representative XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and she advised me that I was qualified for a repayment and I would have to pay a down payment of {$950.00} and I would pay a payment and a half for 6 months of approximately $ XXXX.She advised me that I had until XX/XX/XXXX, or they would have to recalculate the payments for XXXX. She advised me she would be out of town and would be able to be reached until later the first week of XXXX. 

I called on XX/XX/XXXX, to get my new calculations and she advised me that I didn't qualify for the repayment plan based on my income, but I qualified for the repayment plan for XXXX. When questioned, she told me I was stressing her out, I was being petty about what she was saying to me. XXXX XXXX also told me they didn't have my updated income or budget and they did. 

All of this time I've been talking to Bank of America and trying to get a modification or repayment plan, they never advised me that I was entering foreclosure. I was actively trying to pay the balance off. They never advised me of dual tracking. I called today, XX/XX/XXXX, to pay the balance that was approximately {$2100.00} and she told me I couldn't pay today because I have entered foreclosure. I asked was I in foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX, when we talked two days before today? She told me no, which I find hard to believe that I'm now in foreclosure. I was never advised these past two or three months I've been speaking with her that I was in foreclosure. 

Now I have to wait until after XX/XX/XXXX, and I'm sure it will include more charges for me to reinstate my mortgage. I have the {$2100.00} and would have paid it on XX/XX/XXXX, if she had informed me I was in foreclosure. 

The problem I had paying my mortgage is I haven't worked full time since XXXX and struggled to make payments. I hadn't made a payment since XX/XX/XXXX because I was raising the funds to pay the past due of the mortgage, but Bank of America never told me I was in dual tracking when I was trying to get a modification."

I received the escrow statement from Bank of America and it does not provide clear instructions on how I can pay my escrow shortage so my monthly bill isn't impacted going forward. It is very confusing and will likely lead to customers maintaining a higher monthly payment. Their website also doesn't allow you to pay the shortage without paying the monthly mortgage payment. It seems that they want to keep me at a higher monthly payment amount which isn't beneficial to how I pay my monthly bills.

Bank of America has sent us a letter stating that our loan will change XXXX 2015 and our monthly payment will be adjusted from {$1100.00} a month to {$3600.00} a month starting XXXX 2015. An amount we can not afford to pay. 
We went to go see XXXX XXXX, Mortgage Broker, at our local Bank of America office, at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to get our equity line refinanced or to streamline our XXXX loans. She informed us that Bank of America could not refinance our loan or streamline our loan ( both loans are with Bank Of America ) and suggested we contact their Modification Office. We have heard that getting your loan Modified rarely happens, is a terrible deal if you do get a Modification, they take months to get it done and hurts your credit. 
Our income to Mortgage percentage is way out of the acceptable range for a traditional refinance. Our credit rating is XXXX and we have not been late on a mortgage payment in XXXX years. 
My wife also works in the XXXX XXXX industry. 
With our good credit history and our ability to weather the economic down turn, I think there should be other options besides just your income to mortgage percentage:1. The fact that we have never been late for a mortgage payment in XXXX years. 
2. The fact that an independent businessman has ups and downs that span over years. The possible success in the future should be looked at. 
3. Our XXXX mortgage should not be jeopardized because we have to refinance our XXXX. 
Bank of America 's actions are going to force us to sell our house that we have lived in for XXXX years. We can not afford their new monthly payment. There is plenty of equity in our house to support a loan. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, XXXX XXXX at Bank of America estimated our home value at XXXX XXXX and XXXX estimate is XXXX XXXX. 
Can you help us with Bank Of America to refinance our equity line or extend our interest only payments for another XXXX years in order to keep our loan payment at it 's present rate so we can stay in our house. We have proven that we can successfully pay our mortgage. I feel this tactic of selling loans without fully explaining what happens after XXXX years is another scam by Bank Of America to extort more money out of the American people and to force families to sell their home even though they have a great payment record and plenty of equity. 
We have already shown these documents to XXXX XXXX at Bank of America just to receive a flat out no."
Mortgage,"I obtained an FHA home loan from XXXX XXXX in XXXX loan # XXXX. Recently, the tax value was assessed to be {$320000.00}, the value due on the home is {$250000.00} which would indicate that more than 20 % of the home loan has been paid off. I called bank of America XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a home loan specialist to ask if my PMI could be removed. She indicated that she thought that it could be removed, and that she was able to send a request to remove the PMI which was a good sign. She stated that I would receive a letter with the decision to remove PMI within 10 days. After 10 days had passed, with no letter provided, I called and spoke to another home loan specialist who stated that the loans PMI could never be removed for the life of the loan. The loan officer never informed me of this, instead he stated that at 20 % of the loan paid, PMI could be removed, as I would be able to call and request this. I asked to speak with a manager for further explanation, however after speaking with XXXX for over 1 hour, I was given no explanation because XXXX stated that he did not understand the process and could only read me the letter stating that the PMI could not be removed. I waited for over 1 hour to speak with a manager, however no manager was available. My complaints are : 1. I was told by my loan officer and the first home loan specialist that the PMI could be removed. Had I been told by my loan officer that this could not happen, for the life of the loan, I would not have selected this loan. 2. In politely and patiently contacting Bank of America repeatedly for assistance in understanding the PMI, I was told that no one was available to explain the loan."
Mortgage,I applied for the HomeOwners Assistance Fund for my state of Florida back in XX/XX/2022. I received an email that I was approved for 6 months of payments for my electric and mortgage on XX/XX/2022 starting XX/XX/2022. I contacted the HAF and was advised that both payments were sent out on the same day which was no later than XX/XX/2022. My electric company received my payment on XX/XX/2022 but my mortgage company is claiming to not have received any payment via the mail and I was charged a late fee as of XX/XX/2022. Ive been in contact with both HAF and my mortgage company daily since XX/XX/2022. The HAF is advising that they cant start an investigation in to whether the check was cashed until XX/XX/2022. Its almost time for another mortgage to come due and Im scared of being charged additional late fees and as well as being reported late to the credit bureau. I just want my mortgage company to apply the payment if theyve received it. Its hard to believe that one check was received by the electric company but the other one was lost in the mail since they both were mailed the same day. I believe my mortgage is slow to apply the payment to intentionally charge a late fee which I cant not afford to pay.
Mortgage,"I am currently in the process trying to secure a mortgage for a new house. When my lender went to process my file I showed up as having a foreclosure in the last 3 years ( XX/XX/XXXX ) ... This is where my complaint starts, and it is in regards to my previous mortgage situation ( XXXX XXXX I believe acquired by Bank of America ) that I secured in XX/XX/XXXX. Starting in XX/XX/XXXX, CountryWide initiated the foreclosure process ( See Attachment # 1 ). In XX/XX/XXXX, I vacated the property and started the process for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy. The bankruptcy included the property ( See Attachment # 2 ) and final judgment was issued XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachment # 3 ).  Then in XX/XX/XXXX the foreclosure case initiated by Countrywide was dismissed because they failed show up to a hearing according to court records ( See Attachment # 4 ). I believe the mortgage* was acquired by Bank of America through their acquisition of XXXX XXXX . In XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America initiated the foreclosure ( See Attachment # 5 ), final judgment issued XX/XX/XXXX ( See Attachment # 6 ) and sold the property to XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX ( See Attachment # 7 ). This means that the property wasn't foreclosed on for roughly 9 years. I did some research ( I understand not official ), but there were articles referencing in the state of Florida companies have years to file foreclosure and then in XX/XX/XXXX I believe there were a few appeal cases that allowed lenders not to go by the 5 years ( I don't know too much about this ). I believe the lenders have an obligation to foreclose on the properties in a timely fashion. This is something that is almost a decade old and it is preventing me from purchasing a new at this time even I followed the correct process back in XX/XX/XXXX. This foreclosure is showing up in the HUD CAIVRS report as a foreclosure in the last 3 years. It is not fair the lender did not timely foreclose on this property. I believe this potentially could be an unethical and unfair practice by the lender. It took them 9 years from when the initial foreclosure started in XX/XX/XXXX. I did my part and they did not do theirs. This should have foreclosed back in XX/XX/XXXX, but they failed to show up to their own hearing. Thank you for taking the time to review this and their practices. I hope this can get resolved as I am currently under contract for a house with a closed of XX/XX/XXXX. Have a great day."
Mortgage,"This complaint is connected to complaint number XXXX that I previously submitted. 
After Bank of America told me I was not approved for a refinance, I requested an adverse action notice. I was told I needed to "" formally '' apply and pay the credit report and appraisal fees totaling more than {$550.00}. The fees are not refundable. I do not understand why Bank of America would charge ( and KEEP ) an appraisal fee when the company has no intention of completing an appraisal. 

The conversations about this took place on XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX E. T. I was told the conversation was recorded."
Mortgage,"Ive been unsuccessful having Bank of America apply my lump sum mortgage payments appropriately to payoff the loan in full, stop being charged interest and receive the balance of my substantial escrow funds. Ive attempted on at least four separate occasions starting approximately XX/XX/XXXX to get an accurate payoff, after which I sent funds in excess of the amount required only to find that the funds were misapplied to a suspense account-effectively putting them in a XX/XX/XXXX account while B of A collects interest on my money. Each time Id get a new bill with an outstanding balance. And each time Id call back, ask what happened- B of A would say sorry, they didnt know where to apply the funds, theyre in a suspense account, Ill have it corrected, but you still owe {$890.00} Id send the new payoff. The next call, when the funds werent applied, went the same path with B of A apologizing for misapplied funds that went to a suspense account followed by a new payoff quote of {$10.00}. Undeterred I went to my local bank and wired {$100.00} ( 10x what they requested ) as per their wiring instructions. Again B of A promised resolution, payoff and my escrow funds. They got it wrong again. Instead of a payoff and funds I got a new bill with a $ XXXX balance. Im on the phone with B of A as we speak on XX/XX/XXXX. Guess what, same apology, same suspense, misapplied funds explanation saying well get it corrected, well give you proof of payoff and balance of escrow. I have zero faith this will be accomplished. My request : please get me proof of payoff and escrow funds, retro to my original request, along with any accrued interest. 
Please consider conducting a full audit of B of A servicing and control practices. If this is happening to me, a long term client ( who has never made a late payment ) Im fairly certain, other clients funds are being misapplied, mismanaged, perhaps costing clients hundreds of thousands of dollars in aggregate"
Mortgage,"I am writing to inform you that Bank of America has engaged in retaliation following my filing of complaint XXXX on XX/XX/2023. 

On Saturday XX/XX/2023 we received an Escrow Analysis letter from Bank of America backdated to XX/XX/2023. We had not received such a letter previously. 

This letter falsely alleges that our family paid only {$5400.00} of a XXXX tax bill of {$9700.00}. The letter states that there was an underpayment of {$4300.00}. The letter states that due to this underpayment, our monthly mortgage bill will increase by nearly {$400.00} per month. 

Upon review of our records we show that we actually paid {$9300.00} of the {$9700.00} tax bill through monthly equal escrow payments of approximately {$770.00}. The probable underpayment amount based on this is about {$430.00}. This is nowhere near the underpayment amount of {$4300.00} indicated on the letter we received. Furthermore, the letter includes dollar amounts that Bank of America knows are not part of Escrow ( e.g. Insurance ). 

Bank of America is using the US Mail to send financial debt information to us that it knows to be false for the apparent purpose of defrauding us. 

Because of our recent written complaints against bank of America for what we believe are violations of State and Federal predatory lending Settlement agreements ( this was contained in certified letters sent to Bank of America - dated XX/XX/2023, XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023 ), we are now being targeted and retaliated against by a significant and an unjustified increase to the monthly mortgage payment in order to place an additional hardship on our family. 

In addition, we have attempted to contact the regulatory affairs person identified for the response and resolution to the original complaint ( # XXXX ). We have not received a call back nor have we received any document showing the response submitted to the CFPB from Bank of America. We have not authorized Bank of America to send any communications electronically. We have received nothing in the mail to date. 

I sent certified letters and a fax to Bank of America authorizing my husband to speak and correspond on these matters. 

I am enclosing a copy of the letter ( along with envelop showing postmark date ) we received from Bank of America regarding Escrow and a copy of the most recent letter sent authorizing my husband to speak on my behalf. My husband is authorized to speak regarding this matter as well."
Mortgage,"I am writing to request correction of the error described below and to STOP the Trustees Sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. This is in regard to the mortgage on my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, your company must respond to letter before the foreclosure sale.

Because the trustee assumes the liability in auctioning the property in California a non-judicial foreclosure state, it would be in the trustees best interest not to foreclose on the property due to the following potential violations discovered before the Auction Sale Date.

- The Trustee failed to issue a notice of default. The notice of default was done prior to ( you ) the trustee being assigned. This is a clear example of foreclosure laws and procedures.

- Your company has violated the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau by Duel Tracking a foreclosure date after a complete loss mitigation application was received more than 37 days prior to a sale date. Your company denied my loan modification appeal on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ).

- Your company duel tracked a foreclosure date during this process of XX/XX/XXXX. You are required to provide more than 37 days after such denial to the consumer before scheduling such foreclosure sale date.

The CFPBs existing rules prohibit servicers from taking certain actions in foreclosure once they receive a complete loss mitigation application from a borrower more than 37 days prior to a scheduled sale. However, in some cases, borrowers are not receiving this protection, and servicers foreclosure counsel may not be taking adequate steps to delay foreclosure proceedings or sales. The CFPBs new rule clarifies that, if a servicer has already made the first foreclosure notice or filing and receives a timely complete application, servicers and their foreclosure counsel must not move for a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, even if a third party conducts the sale proceedings, unless the borrowers loss mitigation application is properly denied, withdrawn, or the borrower fails to perform on a loss mitigation agreement. The clarifications will aid servicers in complying with, and assist courts in applying, the dual-tracking prohibitions in foreclosure proceedings to prevent wrongful foreclosures.

- Your company has failed to acknowledge receipt of a NEW complete loss mitigation application received XX/XX/XXXX on your website loanhelpstatus.bankofamerica.com and open a new loan modification process.

-Your companys customer relationship manager XXXX XXXX onXX/XX/XXXX said that none of the documents from XX/XX/XXXX have been reviewed. The documents need to be resubmitted. The same documents were submitted and completed on XX/XX/XXXX.

-Your company must stop the foreclosure sale date on XX/XX/XXXX to prevent wrongful foreclosure a complete violation of the dual tracking regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .

Mortgage,Have a home equity line of credit from Bank of America since 2018. Selling my house and needed to close the account for release of lien. Made all my payments on time. XXXX  balance. BOA now charging a early closure fee of {$450.00}!! in addition to a lien release fee. Never was told at closing in 2018 regarding all these fees. Just a total ripoff.
Mortgage,"1. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I made XXXX investment (rental) home purchases in Florida. Fraud intent loan applications were submitted by mortgage brokers wilfully, selling XXXX apartments in same complex to me, same day. Submitting my applications fraudulently (for 1st and 2nd mortgages on each) to 1. Different banks on same day ! 2. Putting ""primary residence' as info so banks can make the loan-all can profit from such practices. Such banks were: Bank of America, Countrywide, XXXX, XXXX, and others that went under since !

2. Now these BAD LOANS are sold (for pennies on the dollar value) to XXXX 'bad loan' shark markets, that engage ""collection agencies', these then employ/ recruit law offices to sue to collect as much as they can in a) settlement or b) lawsuit for full amounts plus ridiculous/ ""max ALLOWABLE CUSTOMARY"" charges Law office charges for income garnish.

3. All in all : Victimization. And only a few are selectively so, while others have been consolidated on paper by system bankrupted by such pratices.

I am also going to write such details to political parties and presidential candidates, so that others in my fraud intent forced situation can be protected."
Mortgage,"Sometime last year I was dealing with a rep at Bank of America ( BOFA ) by the name of XXXX XXXX. I submitted a CFPB complaint regarding my home foreclosure and how I tried to modify my home loan, but was never helped. When I did a CFPB complaint XXXX helped me get my documents processed. Once everything was processed he was able to get me a trial period for payments of {$500.00} each month if my trial period was completed successfully. 

I finished the trial period successfully. A letter arrived asking me to sign the new loan terms and the payment amount was higher. I discussed the matter with XXXX and he said that should have not happened. He said he would fix that issue and asked me to sign and fax the document with the incorrect information. I had no choice, but to sign the document. I faxed it at a BOFA branch and received fax confirmation. During this time XXXX said to pay the {$500.00} payments because that was supposed to be the set amount. I made those payments on time every month. 

Time passes and I notice that the information in my statement does not make sense. I received document saying that my home will be foreclosed on/in foreclosure process. It was around XXXX when the bank stopped accepting my payments. 

This lead me to create another CFPB complaint about 3 or 4 months ago. At this time BOFA was requesting that I make payments of around {$950.00}, which was not apart of the agreement. In addition, the terms of the loan did not make sense. 

After my second CFPB complaint, another rep from BOFA contacted me ( XXXX XXXX ). She explained that somehow my initial medication agreement paper work was not processed and that 's why I was received the threatening foreclosure statements and the increase in monthly payments. She tried to help me and looked into this matter. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a letter with the correct payment amount for my monthly payments with a new trial period beginning XXXX XXXX, 2016. Again, I made the payments AGAIN. I found it ridiculous to go through this process again. Why could n't bank of America just fix THEIR error???? Why do I have to go through this mess again? 

What can I do? I am forced to do whatever they say because they leave you no choice. I have showed intent to pay. I have made a year worth of payments. 

On the XXXX XXXX document, I was instructed to fill out the new contract and send it back to BOFA in 15 days. I contacted XXXX XXXX explaining my issues. 1 ) the information on my credit is inaccurate because BOFA dropped the ball and did not process my original accepted modification agreement. XXXX XXXX said it is now fixed. 2 ) The maturity date of my loan does not make sense. She said my maturity date had been extended, but it has not been extended. I also was curious as to if I was in a balloon payment because I thought it was a 30 year fixed. 

Throughout this time, I have been playing phone tag with XXXX XXXX. Everytime we had an appointment to discuss the answer to my questions, she was never available at her appointment. Everytime I left her a message, she never responded. It would take atleast XXXX messages till she would respond. This is not fair. She said she closed the matter on her end, but she never answered my questions. Till this day the issue of my maturity date is not resolved. 

BOFA has sent me letters regarding my payments for my home loan that are misleading to me and to them. They should not force me to sign something that is not clear. Especially when their letters have conflicting information on it. I would like to speak to another rep. Time is of essence in this matter, and XXXX XXXX does not understand that. Now my home has a sale date of XXXX XXXX, 2016. I do n't know why BOFA is harassing me when this whole issue began because they dropped the ball by not processing the modification agreement last year."
Mortgage,"I have been making an extra payment to my mortgage with BoA on the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX of the month every month for several years now. The regular payment is due on the XX/XX/XXXXof every month - I have always paid on time and there are no pre-payment penalties in the mortgage agreement. The extra payments have been going towards future payments ( interest included ) and not the principal balance. I have contacted BoA numerous times, most recently XXXX XXXX, resolution specialist for regulatory complaints. I have previously filed two CFPB complaints regarding this matter ( Case # XXXX ) and there has not been an adequate resolution. BoA is still misapplying my mortgage payments. Page 3 of the mortgage statement regarding application of payments clearly states : "" If your loan is current and you submit additional amounts, [ ... ] if no instructions are provided they will be applied to the principal of the loan. '' Furthermore, under the title Paying Your Loan Ahead, it states : "" We allow you to prepay your periodic payments one month in advance. '' "" [ ... ] any attempt to prepay more than one periodic payment on your loan will result in your payments being applied to the principal of the balance of your loan. '' Throughout this issue BoA has been aware of my desires to apply extra payments to the principal of the loan. They have been continually misapplying these payments, in violation of their own terms and agreements within the mortgage, and the application of payments statement, as well as inaccurately reporting these future payments ( interest included ) on my credit report.
BoA 's solution to prevent future payments from being misapplied all include using services that  charge per payment. I currently use XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who writes a check to BoA twice a month. I am unable to write a personal check due to travel as a function of military obligations ( XXXX ). Through BoA 's attempted collection of fees for payments they are artificially inflating my interest rate on the mortgage, and preventing me from paying down the principal of the mortgage to further the bank 's collection of interest. I am again requesting that BoA retroactively from XXXX 2017, and in the future correctly apply additional principal only payments to the loan and abide by the terms and conditions stated in the mortgage agreement, and issued monthly on their statement to me. Currently my mortgage is paid through XXXX 2017 - this is completely unacceptable, and not accurately reflected in my credit report ( a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act - subject to a {$1000.00} fine ). All mid month payments shall be principal only payments from the origination of the loan until it is paid in full."
Mortgage,"My mother died 5 years ago. One year before that she signed the deed over my to name. When she died I contacted Bank of America 's legal department and they sent me a whole bunch of papers that I had filled out notarized and signed back to them. I called now because Governor XXXX put into effect that mortgage payments can be waived for 90 days. Since I am not working because the school I work at is closed due to the virus and I am not being paid, I called Bank of America to try to find out how the 90 day waiver worked. I am being told that I can not speak to anybody unless I get a court order saying that the house is mine. I have been paying this mortgage for 5 years my name is listed all over the contact information I am the daughter of the person that owned it, I have lived in this house since I was XXXX  and sent them all the paperwork you needed. Now in the time of state of emergency you're telling me I need to go to court to get a court-approved document saying I own the house when I already have a deed, to speak to somebody. They are asking for me to obtain a document from a court saying I can talk to them when all the courts are closed because of this virus. They already have all the paperwork in their possession. I am the last of my family I have no other family living. She did have a will and everything was left to me since I was the sole survivor or heir however you want to put that. I have given this information to them before and they have told me the information I needed when I called and now all of a sudden during state of emergency they're telling me I need to go to court to get a document saying the property is mine when I have a deed saying it is. This does not have to go through probate court because there is nothing to probate and they will not understand this. The property is listed as an estate on their Bank documents how would they know to listed it as that unless they got all the information from me."
Mortgage,"1. Bank of America resolution specialists will not provide me with requested contact information, i.e. Emails, phone numbers, to BofA executives and CEO. 

2. XXXX XXXX, manager of XXXX XXXX ( my assigned account specialist ) ( XXXX ) XXXX will not return phone calls. I left over XXXX messages.

Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a phone call from my Bank of America case representative in regards to my complaint about receiving an incorrect XXXX tax form. The Rep XXXX XXXX stated that BOA reviewed my interest payments and my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX form was indeed correct. I told her she has been misinformed and she was incorrect. She kept going on about a partial claim which has nothing to do with interest paid. She advised me to wait on the paperwork she was sending via mail with the breakdown. However, I informed her I already received a breakdown from BOA regarding my payment and interest transactions on XX/XX/XXXX. In that document it shows each monthly payment and interest paid for XX/XX/XXXX which totaled in {$10000.00} of interest paid for XX/XX/XXXX. Now if this document was sent to me by BOA themselves, then how are they now contradicting themselves and saying the original XXXX of $ XXXX is correct? 

Instead of the representative listening to me and awknowledging the fact that i didnt need to waste time waiting another week or more since I already received a breakdown from BOA, she just totallly dismissed me. I 've attached the interest breakdown from BOA 's own documentation they sent me from the cited case number as well as the incorrect XXXX form. This needs to be taken care of immediately as it ia almost the deadline for taxes and I have been dealing with this since early XX/XX/XXXX!! 

In addition to this matter, I have not heard anything on my dispute of the cited case number regarding the "" missing payments '' that BOA XXXX XXXX, on behalf of XXXX XXXX stated the cited case numbers response to me. I supplied documentation prooving that I never missed a mortgage payment except when BOA directed me to. I have attached those documents as well."
Mortgage,"Bank of America continue to report negative items on my credit reports to the major credit bureaus, even after I asked them to discontinue this practice, because I am disputing these items. I even mailed certified return receipts stating "" this account is being disputed '' and this company still did not ask these credit bureaus to place this label on my accounts, and they continued to report negative items.

Mortgage,"I have had a Bank of America Equity Line since XX/XX/2004. I have NEVER been late. I pay in a local branch each month. I was informed that my payment would be increasing. I stated that it is high. I was told that I could apply for a loan modification. I was sent paper work with a 3 month trial at a reduced payment. I paid this payment as instructed but was marked late thereby reducing my credit score. 

I called BOA and was told they could not remove the late. I then called again and spoke to 4 people of whom 3 were supervisors. Each one said that the late could not be removed. 

They referred to the frequently asked questions that accompanied the loan modification trial that states : Your score can be affected. 

No one told me nor did I see in writing that it would be reported late. 

BOA stated it is a risk that it could which leads me to believe not all customers are reported late during this trial period. 

Please note, I did NOT pay it late. I paid the trial period amount as instructed. I have never been late since it was opened in 2004. 

Thank you,"
Mortgage,bank of america is refusing to acknowledge my authorized third party and refusing to provide me with the documents requested in the information request and refusing to fix the errors mentioned in the notice of errors. bank of america is charging more on the payoff than the final judgment.
Mortgage,"I paid my mortgage off in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$250.00} with Bank of America. When I did my payoff, they told me that I owed for Home Owner Association ( HOA ) dues in amount of {$2300.00} which I was not aware of, so I started to make payments in the amount of {$62.00} bi- monthly and they are still showing that I owe {$4200.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. Attached is a fax from XX/XX/XXXX showing that my HOA dues were paid by BOA with a wire in the amount of {$2600.00}. When my house was paid off, I was sent a check for the escrow, so there should not have been any payments taken out after that. When I paid off my house, I was told by the escalation employee ( XXXX ) that I had to leave a dollar in in the mortgage account, so I left the dollar on XX/XX/XXXX and I made one final payment to pay off the HOA in the total amount of {$1000.00} which I paid on XX/XX/XXXX as requested by BOA. I was talking to my HOA when BOA intervened and made the situation much more financially burdensome. The HOA was willing to negotiate with me and I was not aware that BOA had paid the fees until I came in to payoff my mortgage loan. This has impacted my credit score negatively. I have tried to work with Bank of America since XX/XX/XXXX and have not have any success. In the meantime, they are still paying my taxes, which should be coming to me since XX/XX/XXXX. I have repeatedly asked them to stop paying my taxes and I can not get anyone to listen to what I need.."

Mortgage,"Our mortgage was finally modified on XX/XX/XXXX after a 2 years of struggling to get approved from XXXX XXXX XXXX and in great THANKS to your involvement. Our original mortgage was thrown into default by Bank of America force placing a XXXX flood insurance on our loan for no just cause, we called them to cancel it and got a run around every time until finally between adjustment rates and over due fees and additional unnecessary insurance we fell behind. Now conveniently enough SLS has given back the servicing rights to Bank of AMERICA and we just got a notice from Bank of America that our mortgage is going from {$2300.00} to {$3500.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX 
Our nightmare is going to start all over again unless you help us! My husband is on a fixed Social Security XXXX and we on a strict budget with all our expenses. XXXX XXXX Servicing paid XXXX Homeowners Insurances and I called Bank of America the XXXX time on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX at XXXX extension XXXX, she explained to us that their system takes about 15 to 30 days to update and to keep calling every week to make sure they have the XXXX files already in their system, without they can not assist. As of yesterday XX/XX/XXXX they still do not have records showing the homeowners Insurance payment history updated and we are in a time crunch for XXXX 's mortgage payment to take effect. I understand we 60 days for changes to be fully in place with the transferring of servicers ' but this is all an unnecessary evil happening all over again. 
Attached are the Escrow Statements sent to us by XXXX XXXX Servicing, XXXX escrow statement is from XX/XX/XXXX and then the XXXX escrow statement is dated XX/XX/XXXX. On each individual statement you see a Homeowners Insurance Payment, I found this convenient for them so it looks like its only been paid to XXXX Insurance company and also found having XXXX Escrow statements within a 2 month timeframe a bit odd as well. Bank of America is XXXX again our servicer, we are very happy about that because we believe XXXX XXXX XXXX is a debt collector and knows nothing about servicing home mortgage loans. It 's a very scary world out there for these homeowners dealing with modifications and if you are not scanning all your correspondence you will once again be at risk of losing your home. 
We as and plead for your assistance, I ca n't lose my house because of bad record keeping on someone else 's part, a part that they are responsible to keep track of."
Mortgage,I contacted Bank of America when I got behind in my mortgage payments. I asked for a loan modification. They sent me a packet of forms. I filled them all out and faxed them and the nessacary documents all back to them. I spoke to them numerous times while they said they received them. Then every other week they said they did n't get this or that. So I faxed them over and over. And continued to call and talk to the to stay on top of things. Then they said oh the forms are over 90 days old we need new forms and documents. So I faxed new forms and documents. I had a loss in income and provided documentation. Again XXXX need new forms and documents. Again I faxed new documents and forms. All mean while they had there collection people calling me from XXXX to XXXX over and over all day long. Being rude while I explained my situation over and over. Threading for foreclosure. After a good 9 or 10 months went by I could n't understand why or what was taking so long. I told them if they did n't process my request and give me an answer I would drive to California and contact the local news media. Suddenly I received what they said was a modification. Now instead of my payment being a little over {$1000.00} a month it went to {$1300.00} a month. There were property taxes they claimed I owed and they were paying yet I have an Exemption due to military XXXX. I contacted the XXXX County Tax Assecors office and spoke to them. They told me all tax payments had been sent back to Bank of America and gave me the dates & amounts refunded & even the dates those checks were cashed. Yet Bank of America still has never refunded that money to my escrow or stopped charging my account for taxes they are not paying. They said paying the inflated payment was my only option and I did not qualify for any of there programs. Either I agreed to pay or they would foreclose on my home. And if I made the trial payments on time they would drop all the fees associated with my payments being late at the end of the trial period. I made the trial payments and no they did n't drop the fees they tacked an additional {$15000.00} plus in fees onto my loan. I could n't keep making the inflated payment as I lost more income. I contacted them again and there Help line told me there was nothing I qualified for in terms of help but that this Law office XXXX could help me But that I would have to pay them {$3600.00} in 3 monthly payments of {$1200.00} each. I paid and they said they would get my modification and straighten out the tax issue. I was sent the same forms Bank of America sent 3 times I filled them out and faxed them the forms & documentation. But got nothing suddenly I started receiving letters from lawyers saying my house was in forclosure and about to be sold on the courthouse steps. But no letter from Bank of America I called back and forth to XXXX and got the run arround being Tx that all these lawyer letters were just a scam and I had nothing to worry about. I called Bank of America and they passed me arround to multiple extensions and said they would get back to me but nothing. I then called XXXX of the letters I received from XXXX XXXX Firm and they told me to come in for a free consultation. I did and sure enough my house was in foreclosure and about to be sold. So I filed Bankruptcy and here I am
Mortgage,"In XXXX 2011, I was granted a loan modification on my mortgage with Bank of America. In the time since, I have paid my mortgage in accordance with that modification. Last month, I received a XXXX XXXX package with documents on Bank of America Home Loan letterhead and a cover letter stating that there was an error in the format of the documents and they were unable to be recorded at the county recorder 's office. The letter goes on to say that a representative from XXXX XXXX would meet me at my home to instruct me on signing the papers and notarizing them. I did not sign the paperwork. 
Last week, I came home to find a gentleman sitting in a car in front of my home. He said he was with XXXX XXXX. He handed me a letter which instructed me to call XXXX XXXX to schedule a time for a representative to come to my home. He then proceeded to take pictures of my home, and to ask me if I wanted to have a notary visit my home. I told him no and asked him to leave. 
I receive calls daily from an XXXX number. When I answer, no one speaks. I checked the number of the web and forums have shown that it is XXXX XXXX. They never leave a message, and never speak when I answer their calls. 
I am VERY concerned. I personally had my paperwork notarized back in 2011. I have not been able to reach anyone at Bank of America who can tell me what is going on. And given that it is now XXXX years later, I find it very hard to believe that it has taken Bank of America this long to determine that the mortgage was not recorded with the county. 
I feel that either this is an attempt by XXXX Services to get personal information or somehow execute a fraud -- or Bank of America is trying to backtrack on something that they have done illegally. At any rate, I 'm feeling very uncomfortable with the entire situation, and even more so now that someone has shown up at my home. 
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."
Mortgage,"I am filing this complaint once again due to the nature of wrongful foreclosure and underhand selling of my home enforced due to mishandling of my loan with BofA/Countrywide. My loan amount obtained was for {$550000.00} but last was said to be {$820000.00} for Mortgage Arm Loan. My loan was acquired with originally Countrywide XXXX but BofA managed to buy off loan during bankrupt in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX finalization. We made payments till we could no longer due to seeking resolution but advised to not pay in order to qualify for assistance. Worked hard to try get Fixed loan and out of Predatory Stated Income Arm loan from Countrywide. Finally, after pleading & begging a supervisor announced we should have been for help when first 30 days late bc there was programs to assist. We received trial payments XXXX but during course of time my husband suddenly died n was main borrower although I remained on deed. Payments continued being made until BofA Rep advised to stop making payments oddly. With doing so I advised him to note my account and I took his ID n info to reference. Couple months later, XXXX I received denial of Modification for failure to complete payments. I phoned several times on matter and explained but never heard. When I was heard on occasions my Relationship manager would resubmit Mod however, slim chance bc I was given XXXX in pass. Every time I followed up my Relationship manager consistently changed over 20 dozens time causing dual-tracking to take place. I was persistent to get help so I can assume loan and get help so I can make my payments to avoid losing home for my young children, however, no consistent manager on my file and they kept running me around to do other things like probate which costs, seek legal offices and said legal office to help with Mod in which I paid all these people and did not get any help at all when all I wanted was to pay my mortgage. BofA owned my loan and lied several times about it not allowing me any type of resolution or exhausted any options so I can keep my home. This should have never happened and yet it did. The banks keep getting away with this form of matter and I feel the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX about it ( for I complained before and yet your office sued the Banks for Shady business ) nor the judicial system because more judges favor big Corporations instead of the truth and poor people. I had a lawsuit in XXXX in which was dismissed due to statue of limitations and the Judge XXXX XXXX did not allow my evidence to be reviewed nor discovery of evidence was ignored. I DID NOT WANT TO SUE, I JUST WANTED TO WORK OPTIONS TO KEEP MY HOME, that was then later put in placed by OBAMA but still ignored for XXXX homeowners, but BofA shady XXXX forced me into this by denying my mods and file Default while in Mod Review which is against the Homeowner Bill of Rights. While Civil suit was going BofA tried and managed to succeed selling my home the second time while in litigations which is unfair to my children most important because I had no ill will to not pay I wanted and begged at times for resolution so I can pay, by the way calls are monitored and should be reviewed. All I want is an investigation and to get my home back. I went to XXXX events and other events and XXXX and on the end it still remained in BofA hands because they had say so on any possible resolutions. I have documents and notes of all actions taken place and yet they are not held accountable for their actions. Where is the justice in that? Fraud was committed, Bad Business practice, Defamation of my character, prejudice preying on widows, Homeowner Rights violated bc I should not had to go thru this while grieving my husband. BTW, BofA XXXX to have a said Investigator contact me which was straight BS due to complaints I made several, XXXX XXXX U did nothing liar and fraud too."
Mortgage,"I have a home loan with Bank of America. Last year, my tenant, who was paying the bank directly, stopped payments, and disappeared. I live XXXX, and when I returned, my account was almost in foreclosure because of this. so, I have been in contact with the bank on numerous occasions this year as I have been trying to A ) fix up my home, B ) pay off the months that were due and C ) communicate with the bank in good faith. I only spend a month or so at home in the XXXX each XXXX, so I have asked representatives form Bank of America to contact me directly about issues relating to my account by e-mail on many occasions. So far have only gotten only automated responses giving me phone numbers that I can call in CA regarding my account. I have responded to these e-mails that because of the time difference, it is very difficult for me to call because working hours are in the middle of the night for me. So far, the only communication I have gotten through e-mail from the bank are automated notices about late payments. Recently, I got such a notice, and called the bank. I was shocked to learn that my monthly loan payments have increased by {$400.00} per month. I was never informed of this change, and when I went on the B of A website, there was actually NO payment due amount posted for my account. When I called the bank, I wanted to know the reason for this increase. I was told by a B of A representative that this was due to an increase in county taxes. they said that I had a negative {$2000.00} balance on my escrow account, and so my payments had increased. I was still not convinced, and so went to the website to see if I could make any sense of my escrow account. I found that I have been charged for XXXX separate insurance policies for 2015. Bank of America handles the payment of my home insurance through escrow. I made several calls to the various insurance companies listed on the escrow bill and found out more. Recently, while I was still trying to rent my home, the house was vacant. This was in XXXX of 2015. Even though the house was occupied by XXXX XXXX, my home owners insurance was canceled. The insurance company, XXXX XXXX, may have tried to communicate with me, but I now live in XXXX, so that correspondence did not reach me. However, Bank of America never informed me or my real estate agent of this cancellation. Then, on XXXX XXXX, they called my agent, and said that they were instating a policy for the property that day. My agent had someone find a more affordable policy. So, right now, I have payments for XXXX insurance policies on my escrow account. I called XXXX XXXX, and they told me that they would have to re-instate the account, to give me a refund check which will be sent to my XXXX address. I will be able to then take care of this amount on my bank of america account. However, at this time, because I was never notified of this change, this process will take about XXXX weeks. So, I called Bank of America ( at XXXX my time, on a work night ) so that I could speak to a manager about this and try to clear it up. I was never put through to a manager. I am now told that I have payments of {$1100.00} per month ( even though this amount is not posted to my account online ), a huge increase from the {$730.00} I was paying previously. And there seems to be no way that I can resolve this with the bank. They did send me an automated "" customer survey '' about the call that I made about this matter. I did not try to e-mail them, because when I have, I have received no response from them."
Mortgage,"I agreed to a loan modification on this equity loan which was to start XX/XX/XXXX 2015 with XXXX payments of {$170.00} on the XXXX of the month. I have completed XXXX payments on time only to receive in the mail the XXXX statement indicating the XXXX payment made on their posting account of XXXX/XXXX/15 has increased my previous balance and getting a loan modification has served no purpose other than to collect more funds from me. See attached documents. My understanding with the Bank of America resolution manager was that part of that payment was to go for the principal and part to interest as I inquired before even agreeing to this modification. Instead as you see on this statement they have described the loan modification amount as "" cash receipts '' subtracted it from the previous balance of {$100000.00} XXXX which includes the real equity balance of {$98000.00} plus the past due amount of {$6700.00} XXXX then added on a finance charge of {$220.00} bringing it to {$10000000.00} which is more than the previous balance. This is their way of helping customers with a loan modification."
Mortgage,"Bank of America totally disregarded my objections to being transferred to XXXX who are known bottom feeders. There was absolutely no reason for this transfer other than it was done based on my XXXX  It appears that Bank of America allowed XXXX a look at my loan, XXXX late payments, credit score over 800 I am a A+ borrower. 
"" Homeowners are often transferred to XXXX once they become delinquent on their mortgage payments. Many lenders try to protect their brand when it comes to foreclosing on homeowners. '' The information on XXXX only get 's worse. Being with Bank of America since 2005 and having a excellent record leads to me to believe there is a quid pro quo when he comes to XXXX  and the transferring of their loans. The mortgage industry is well aware of the top tier mortgage companies, XXXX is not one of them. This is a way of identifying subprime loans in the industry, which my loan is not. This XXXX intrinsic and bias behavior is unacceptable and requires an investigation."
Mortgage,I surrendered my property as part of bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX. I can send that doc if you like. Bank of American continues to send me threatening bills for my mortgage.
Mortgage,"My Grievance filing is the following : I have been requesting my Bank to provide me copies of my closing documents on my home for over 30 days. I requested copies of my, The Truth and Lending and ECOA Disclosure, ECOA Appraisal Disclosure, FMNA Form XXXX Uniform Residential Loan Application and A copy of the Appraisal. This has been going on for 30 days and they keep telling me they are looking and or they can not find the documents. I have reached out to The State Attorney Office and the State Banking Commission in my State to also help me obtaining these documents from my Bank. I am reaching out to CFPB to help me obtain these documents on my home from my Bank. 

See Attached letters to my State Agencies for help in this matter"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America ( BofA ) will foreclose on my home even though I have proof they committed fraud and BofA admitted to their fraud. I brought notice to BofA 's compliance department in early XXXX, and on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX from Bank of America 's Regulatory Compliance group admitted that an employee committed fraud after XXXX listened to a recording of the phone call in which a BofA employee lied and told me my escrow would no longer include PMI/MIP : XXXX XXXX : Right, so having heard the conversation you know that I was misinformed, and you know that I would not have signed the loan documents. I mean, that's all in that conversation. So I don't understand, so in other words you have found that what I said was true. That someone did misinform me and therefore I signed loan documents based on that misinformation. 

XXXX : Okay so in regards to that, with that information now that uhm we have that in agreement on there. What exactly are you looking for me to do at this point and time? Because at this point and time I can't remove the mortgage insurance premium. 
( transcribed from a recording of a XX/XX/XXXX phone call that I possess ) Ms. XXXX went on to explain that the only way for the PMI/MIP to be taken off my loan was to meet HUD standard percentages. I did research on XXXX XXXX ' statement and found that federal law disagrees with BofA 's compliance policies. FHA allows for a mutual termination of PMI/MIP. 

BofA 's defense is that their employee said their was no PMI, because the loan included MIP, which is the same thing with a new acronym. My response to that is that I did say mortgage insurance as much as I said PMI, and it is commonly known in the industry that PMI is synonymous with MIP. So, in short, their employee took advantage of the language XXXX she knew I possess. 

BofA 's other defense is that in our phone call on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Ms. XXXX did not agree that the company committed fraud. They do agree that I was given misinformation, but it was an error, not intentional. However, immediately after her first admission she fails to correct me when I refer to the misinformation as fraud : XXXX XXXX : Okay, then I have to go back to the company, the the complaints department and say that you guys agreed that there was fraud, because that's what this is. And then I will see what they're gon na make you guys do. I don't know what they make you do at this point. 

XXXX : I can, I can start that process and look into what the process is in regards to that. I will be more than happy to start that process, because it will just come back to me. 

In response to their refusal to act and rectify their fraud and my lack of money to file a lawsuit, I stopped payments in XX/XX/XXXX in an attempt to recoup the money BofA had defrauded me of since XX/XX/XXXX. In hindsight, it was not my best idea. 

BofA responded first by trying to sell my loan to XXXX, but XXXX refused the loan after I showed them my proof of BofA 's fraud. Soon after, I received notification that Bank of America put my home into foreclosure in response to my new fall payment amounts and lack of payment over the summer of XXXX. 

They also refuse to supply me with my original promissory note. I have asked time after time but still nothing. The one lawyer who even considered working with me needs that to continue. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be homeless in two weeks. 

XXXX XXXX attacked language areas in my brain. It especially hit my ability to hear or take-in numbers, dates, times, payment amounts, etc. Due to this, I either need to find someone to handle my finances or to record financial or task oriented conversations. In XXXX I had full permission to record conversations due to the ADA. Once the foreclosure was in process, my ADA rights were revoked. So began a 12 month battle, that included 5 trips to my local BofA, trying to gain access to my account and find out what I could do to stop foreclosure and keep my home. It took me saying, You guys are trying to steal my home by selling it out from under me just because there is equity in my home. for them to consider giving my rights back. The modification representatives still refuse to take my calls. I need help. I've filed three complaints with the DOJ/ADA, and they have yet to respond. 

I am two weeks away from being out of time. As of today, the Home Retention/Modification Division of Bank of America has not given me my rights back. They are still keeping me from accessing my account unless I speak to one of the managers, who take three to five days to return my phone calls. They are trying to foreclose on my home and won't let me speak with anyone. Please help me. Please. Someone."
Mortgage,"I have contact my current lender bank of america back in XXXX to request a loan modification due to my reduced income. I was told that unless I 'M LATE OR BEHIND ON THE LOAN I WOULD NOT QUALIFY ... Their representative clearly ADVISED ME TO STOP PAYING MY MORTGAGE IF I WANT THE MODIFICATION OFFER SENT TO ME ... ..With no other options offered to me I followed their instructions and stopped paying my mortgage. After I got an offer to modify my loan, representative assured me that if approved that all mortgage lates WOULD BE DELETED from my report. HOWEVER, 3 YEARS LATER THEY STILL HAVE NOT DELETED THE LATES WHICH THEY FORCED ME TO INQUIRE. I have been trying to reason with bank of america since XX/XX/XXXX but all I 'm getting is computer generated mail and no results or any attempt on their end to resolve this issue. Because of these lates now i can not refinance my house or get a better loan .... AND NOW BANK OF AMERICA CALLED ME OFFERING TO DO A DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE.. WHEN I 'M CURRENT ON MY LOAN ... they are desperately trying to STEAL MY HOUSE by ruining my credit and ignoring my request ... please help!!"
Mortgage,"MY EX HUSBAND AND I PURCHASED A HOME IN XXXX IN XXXX MAINE, FROM THE LENDER, BANK OF AMERICA. WE WERE BOTH XXXX AT THE TIME, XXXX  WITH OUR XXXX  CHILD AND HE HAD BEEN AT HIS JOB FOR JUST A FEW MONTHS. bANK OF AMERICA GAVE A MORTGAGE VERY QUICKLY, AND WE WERE PLEASED- ALTHOUGH WE WERE QUITE IGNORANT AT THE TIME ABOUT MORTGAGE RATES AND DEBT IN GENERAL. 

WE STRUGGLED GREATLY ALMOST FROM DAY 1- AS  THE MORTGAGE CRISIS SET UPON US , AND OIL  PRICES SKYROCKETED. WE FOUND THAT, AFTER THE BIRTH OF OUR XXXX CHILD, THE COST OF OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT, OIL TO KEEP THE OLD HOUSE HEATED, AND CHILDCARE WAS FAR MORE THAN WE COULD HANDLE. 

WE ASKED FOR MODIFICATION, AND BANK OF AMERICA KINDLY SENT US THE PAPERWORK ( MORE THAN A FEW TIMES WE HAD TO REQUEST IT ), BUT EVERY TIME WE CALLED TO CHECK THE STATUS OF OUR REQUEST WE WERE FACED WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS WHO DIDNT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT OUR MODIFICATION. WE CONTINUOUSLY HAD TO RE-EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION AND RE-FILL OUT DOCUMENTS FOR WHAT WAS A FRUITLESS ENDEAVOR. WE NEVER RECIEVED A MODIFICATION OR ANY OTHER CONTACT WITH REGARD TO HELPING US. 

IN XX/XX/XXXX WE MOVED OUT OF THE HOME. WE CALLED BANK OF AMERICA TO LET THEM KNOW. THEY FAILED TO SECURE THE PROPERTY AND SEVERAL PIPES BURST- CAUSING QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE. THEY DIDN'T CONTACT US FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN REQUESTING PAYMENT -- WHICH WE ADVISED CONSISTENTLY THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. WE BEGGED THEM TO FORECLOSE SO WE COULD MOVE ON. THEY DID NOT. 

IN XX/XX/XXXX MY HUSBAND AND I DIVORCED- I MOVED BACK INTO THE HOME WITH THE CHILDREN- HAVING NO WHERE ELSE TO GO AT THAT POINT IN MY LIFE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A FRIEND WHO DID FREE WORK TO REPAIR THE BROKEN PIPES. MY CHILDREN AND BASICALLY SQUATTED IN THE HOME WITH NO RUNNING WATER OR HEAT ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER OF XX/XX/XXXX. THROUGHOUT THIS TIME FRAME I WAITED FOR THE BANK TO ASK ME TO LEAVE- BUT THEY NEVER DID. I WOULD CALL AND ASK THEM TO PLEASE JUST TAKE THE HOUSE, BUT NOONE WOULD HELP. 

AFTER STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE HEAT GOING THROUGH THE WINTER OF XX/XX/XXXX, I FINALLY MOVED OUT FOR GOOD. ONCE AGAIN I CALLED THE BANK EVERY FEW MONTHS TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT THEIR INTENTIONS. THEY BEGAN FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH, DESPITE MY CALLS AND PLEADINGS TO ESCALATE THE SITUATION, FORECLOSE!, ANYTHING! 

IT IS NOW XX/XX/XXXX- 8YEARS AFTER WE FIRST BEGAN ASKING BANK OF AMERICA FOR HELP- FOR EXPEDITION- FOR ANYTHING- AND THIS HOUSE STILL SITS ABANDONED WHERE WE LEFT IT. iT IS IMPROPERLY SECURED- AND ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT TO GO IN. THE MORTGAGE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE SERVICER XXXX AT SOME POINT IN XX/XX/XXXX I BELIEVE. THEY HAVE BEEN JUST AS UNHELPFUL AS BOA WAS. 

MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE BANK HAS NOT FORECLOSUED ON THIS PROPERTY IN A TIMELY FASHION. THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, AND OFF OF MY CREDIT REPORT BY NOW- BUT STILL IT SITS, RUINING MY CHANCES OF RECOVERING FROM THIS TERRIBLE PART OF MY LIFE. 

XXXX XXXX STILL CALLS ME DAILY! THEY TELL ME I'M LATE ON MY PAYMENTS ..."
Mortgage,"I have had a mortgage with bank of America since XXXX the pymt is due on the first but I have a 15 day grace period. However, about a week to 10 days before my grace period is up they charge an extra {$6.00} for me to make the payment on line. this was not in ther terms of my initial loan agreement and I do n't see how they can charge that since I 'm not past due. I would like all these fees I 've paid refunded to me and I 'd like to know how to inquire about a class action law suit."
Mortgage,"I entered a one-year forbearance plan in XX/XX/XXXX. From my understanding, the forbearance was from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. In hopes of addressing the back owed amount prior to the forbearance ending, I reached out to Bank of America in XX/XX/XXXX to confirm my options. BofAs representative advised that I had to pay the entire forbearance upfront. Concerned with the threat of foreclosure, I agreed to look into it and follow back up. 

I reviewed the CARES Act and called BofA back to assert my rights. I was told to submit a request for mortgage assistance through their portal with the guidance of their Home Loan Assistance Document Checklist. The portal stated the process would conclude within 10 days. I maintained close communication with my assigned representative, XXXX XXXX, who confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX that my loan was being updated with modified terms. 

I did not hear anything else for over a month. Concerned with the forbearance ending soon, I connected with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ). I submitted a third-party authorization form via BofAs online portal on XX/XX/XXXX. I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX and their representatives claimed it was not on their system, so I resubmitted it and XXXX faxed it that same day too. BofAs representative XXXX advised me to resume my mortgage payments after XX/XX/XXXX while everything was finalized. 

XXXX explained that because I was able to resume my mortgage payments, I would qualify for a standalone partial claim under the FHA post-forbearance guidelines through the CARES Act, since my loan is an FHA mortgage. I decided to proceed with a standalone partial claim request, especially since my XXXX request for mortgage assistance was getting nowhere, hoping this would finally resolve the forbearance. 

XXXX requested a standalone partial claim on XX/XX/XXXX. BofAs representative stated that the paperwork would arrive via XXXX within 5 8 business days. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX followed up, since I had yet to receive paperwork, and BofAs representative claimed the paperwork could not be mailed out until I was out of the forbearance plan. The second representative recorded the request and stated it could take up to two weeks to confirm if I can be evaluated for it. 

XXXX followed up on XX/XX/XXXX. BofAs representatives refused to continue communicating with XXXX, claiming XXXX was not authorized on the account. I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX. BofAs representative XXXX claimed their records reflected that I did not qualify for a standalone partial claim because I was not current prior to the forbearance. 

I requested an escalation, since I was current prior to entering the forbearance, which he said would take 7 10 business days. I followed up after the 10 days and was advised that there was no record of the escalation request, therefore it would take 7 10 additional business days. I followed up after the additional 10 days and was told there was no update to my escalation."
Mortgage,"For more than XXXX years i have a line of credit on my rental on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX my regular payment until last month was {$180.00}. I just received a statement from BOA for the current payment of {$580.00}, that is XXXX times more from last month. I called BOA and after XXXX mn wait, the lady on the phone advised me that she can not answer my question because i gave the wrong zip code, i have tax record on the property that shows the right zip code i gave her and i have a payment receipt from last month."
Mortgage,"I paid off my loan balance on XXXX XX/XX/21. They did not send me any proof of pay- off. Final bill amount was {$3000.00} on the statement. I called 4 times requested clear tittle on my property. Still, I wait Full Reconveyance."
Mortgage,"I provided payoff funds for my Bank of America mortgage on XXXX XX/XX/2020. However, I inadvertently did not disable the automatic mortgage payment to Bank of America from my XXXX XXXX checking account. As a result, a payment of XXXX was made to Bank of America on XXXX XX/XX/2020. From that time, I have been endlessly trying to get Bank of America to refund the payment. I have made over a dozen calls to BoA each with a hold time in excess of one hour to speak to a representative. Each time I am told that it is being taken care of or that I will be "" called within three days ''. BoA has never returned a single call or made any effort whatsoever to return the funds. I filed a bill pay  claim with XXXX XXXX and am told that XXXX XXXX is not able to reach anyone from BoA. I also filed a claim with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( XXXX XXXX ) however they sent me a summary letter saying that CFPB had jurisdiction. This has been very frustrating because it's an incredibly simple issue but Bank of America has been completely useless at solving the problem and intransigent about taking any real action to solve the issue."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2023, XXXX XXXX, a Bank of America representative, contacted my attorney and let him know that the mortgage application was declined due to the Debt to income ratio. After the contract expired, the seller gave me a 3-day notice to cure, and BOA made me believe that the mortgage would be approved, however, during the conversation, XXXX XXXX acknowledged that the change of occupancy was an element of the denial, which related to my previous complaint about the BOA changing the facts of the occupancy to charge me more fees. XXXX XXXX changed her story about my income during the last minutes of the process when I originally submitted a corrected W2 and they used the corrected w2 to calculate my income. we figured out the error, and BOA recommended I to file an amended return to correct the error, as we did immediately as requested. BOA further requested to write a notarized statement, stating that I was voluntarily agreeing with the change of occupancy to legalize their policy, and I stated my reason why I agreed with them. XXXX XXXX stated that the income was calculated based on my tax return report, not from the W2, which was originally submitted. XXXX XXXX refused to give me the timeline when BOA changed the course but confirmed that they did not use the income on an amended return. XXXX XXXX also mentioned that the Company credit balance was used to attribute to my personal, despite they knew that my company is a XXXX with other shareholders. XXXX XXXX also used derogatory terms regarding my income as a "" flip-flop. '' Based on these acts of BOA, I completely believe that BOA denied my application because I filed my previous complaint about their policy to force mortgagee to pay higher fees."

Mortgage,"Sometime around XX/XX/XXXX, we applied to re-finance our Bank of America home loan. After being told on the phone that we were approved, and even offered congratulations, and after filling out the extensive paperwork, we were denied the refinance because of my wife 's bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America told us that we would have to get this bankruptcy "" re-affirmed ''. I was able to contact the bankruptcy lawyer we used nearly ten years ago and he told me that "" re-affirmation '' was impossible. He said it would have been impossible at the time ( the bankruptcy judge would have thrown it out ) and it remains impossible today. After I told officials at Bank of America this information, they put me in a video conference with XXXX of their agents in XXXX, TX who insisted that it is possible. The bottom line is that we were denied mortgage refinance because of a ten-year-old bankruptcy, the terms of which can not be changed. We believe, based on our current credit and our perfect record of mortgage payment since we bought our home ( XX/XX/XXXX ), that we were unfairly denied mortgage refinance."
Mortgage,"I previously complained about bank of america about the reporting on my discharged accounts during and after my bankruptcy.They agreed to remove the negative remarks they were showing that were in addition to the bankruptcy notation.Now once again they have added those remarks back.They have my account marked as discharged in bankruptcy, but then under history through XXXX they say ( late 90 plus days ) 1 time in the month of discharge.Then under ( worst delinquency ) collection.No discharged loan can ever be late or be in collection by federal law.Also they previously agreed to remove these marks on other complaints"
Mortgage,"I am currently applying for a mortgage with Bank of America. I have been working with a loan specialist for more than 6 weeks, since XX/XX/XXXX ( today is XX/XX/XXXX ), and have yet to receive any approval, approval with conditions, or denial. The bank is now also saying that my ratified purchase agreement is not sufficient. I have supplied documents many times, and documents supplied earlier in the process have had to be re-submitted several times due to the loan specialist not processing documentation. I have documentation of emails showing this pattern, as well as every piece of documentation I have submitted ( attached is one example ). I am about to lose the purchase contract on the house because the bank has taken so long to process the loan, and still can not give me a projected closing date or any other information regarding when this loan may be able to close. Should this loan not be completed by next week, I will no longer have an enforceable purchase contract ( too much time has elapsed ) and I will have to start over on a new mortgage and find a new house to buy before my lease is up. I have communicated with managers and higher-up personnel to try to resolve the issue, to no avail. Communication has been difficult with my loan specialist and I believe that my loan is not being taken seriously by the company and the people processing the loan due to my gender and the size of the loan. This has cost me money and massive amounts of my time, far beyond a normal mortgage process."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has provided me with a written document dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 from their paid legal advisor represented as the CFPB iportal uploaded CFPB Complaints response to multiple CFPB Complaints I have lodged related to my home loan mortgage account during and throughout the MHA HAMP modification process between XXXX XXXX, 2016 through XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
This document has not been uploaded to the CFPB iportal to date and therefore can not to be considered a response to any of the CFPB complaints. Additionally, the document and attachments do not address the concerns presented within the CFPB complaints lodged related to my concerns throughout the loss mitigation processes to date. 
Because Bank of America has engaged in unfair, poor, and deceptive practices, I have no way of knowing what I have been presented with is the final resolution of my concerns or not and just another of Bank of America 's tactics to solicit what they want. 
There has not been a Rescission recorded withdrawing the NOD with the XXXX XXXX County Recorders Office to date."
Mortgage,"I have had a second mortgage with Bank of America for years now. My payment is $XXXX due by the XXXX  of each month. I always receive a statement and since I bank with Bank of America, I simply transfer the funds by bill pay. For July, I received a statement for the month and I made the payment from bill pay on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of $XXXX. The money was removed from my account within 24 hours as usual. On XX/XX/2019, I received a notice from XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicating that my loan had been transferred from Bank of America  to their company and any payments after XX/XX/2019 should be paid to them. Well, on XX/XX/2019 I made the payment to Bank of America per the statement that I received. I contacted XX/XX/XXXXto advise and was told that they didn't have the payment and they were my new servicer. XX/XX/XXXX doesn't have the payment and Bank of America claims as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has been closed.I have been going backwards and forwards since then trying to locate the monies with no avail. XX/XX/XXXXsent me a statement for August indicating that the July payment is still due. Bank of America is oblivious of the payment even though the payment was deducted from my Bank of America checking account.I need to either have the payment sent to XX/XX/XXXX or the money put back into my account so that I can pay XX/XX/XXXXwithout late fees.See documents enclosed for verification."
Mortgage,XXXX of XXXX a mortgage broker and countrywide sold me a fraudulent loan prior to closing the broker explained the terms of the loan wold be 7.25 % interest and would adjust to 8.25 % later after closing I found out that the loan adjusted every 6 months to 14.75 % interest in XXXX of XXXX my house went into foreclosure do to the adjusting interest rate that I could not keep up with.
Mortgage,"I applied for a Home Equity Line Of Credit with Bank of America. The application went smooth, I did it over the phone with a lender. It was sent over to underwriting, I submitted all requested documents. I got an email saying the title work and appraisal had been ordered. Then I got an email back saying they required me to have {$9000.00} in a savings account to be able to be approved for the loan. This was the first time during this entire process that this requirement had been brought up. I really thought it was strange. I only have about {$4000.00} in a savings, so they said they could not move forward with the loan. Had I known this up front, I never would have applied and took the hit on my credit. Obviously, I would have known I would not be approved. But this fact was never disclosed until the end, after the app, the credit pull, the entire process. A supervisor called me after I submitted a complaint on their website about this process. Then, after that, I got a call from the appraiser to schedule an appraisal, so I did that. Thinking maybe it was back on track again. We scheduled for today at XXXX XXXX. Well, the appraiser did not show. I called and she said the bank called her and cancelled it. So, I am really not sure what is going on. I think it is unacceptable that they effectively tricked me into applying for a loan I had no way of getting. And also during the process, the person that took my application on XXXX separate phone calls remarked how young I am. Which, I am XXXX, so I don't know why. But also, how is that relevant? Is that also part of why I was declined? My age? Again, I just find it unacceptable they would not disclose the {$9000.00} requirement up front, make comments on my youth, and then conveniently find this "" loophole '' to decline my application. All while still getting my information into their system and getting an application tick mark for their spreadsheets. And this stuff is all there to see in the emails I have and their recorded phone calls. I also find it unacceptable that they just so blatantly would do all this and not think a customer would take issue with the process."
Mortgage,"Bank of America did not produce a title in a timely fashion resulting in a higher rate of interest on a mortgage loan refinancing. 
We purchased property from the Veterans Administration in XX/XX/XXXX under a land contract. The land contract at the date of purchase was serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX with an interest rate of 6 %. Years later, the servicing of this loan was transferred to Bank of America. 
We applied for refinancing of this loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX.  We completed and submitted all required documents within the following two months and our request was approved with an interest rate of 4 %. The closing date was set for some time in XXXX. 
The closing did not take place in XXXX. We were then told by XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX that we were waiting for a title to be generated by Bank of America and this would take approximately 2-4 weeks. 
After four weeks the Veterans Administration was contacted to ask why we could not get a title for closing and if there was anything the Veterans Administration could do. We were told by the Veterans Administration that Bank of America was responsible for producing a title. 
HUD was also contacted regarding the inability to get a title. HUD recommended that we contact XXXX XXXX of XXXX Michigan. The XXXX XXXX of XXXX Michigan indicated they would investigate the issue. They were no help, citing the XXXX water crisis was taking much of their time. Bank of America never produced a title. 
There was constant communication with XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX as they continued their effort to get a title. In XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America transferred the servicing of the loan to XXXX XXXX. XXXX indicated that they would produce the title. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX then indicated that the process had to start over. We again completed documents and was told it was approved with an interest rate of 4.6 %. Shortly thereafter XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX indicated that if a {$1500.00} tax bill were paid we could get the loan for 4.3 %. Money was borrowed to pay the bill. The closing took place with an interest rate of 4.3 %."
Mortgage,"My husband died two and one-half years ago. The XXXX mortgage on our home is with Bank of America ( although it was originally a Country Wide loan, from a refinance in XX/XX/XXXX ). When we first obtained, in XX/XX/XXXX, our home the loan was in both of our names, but the refinance was obtained in just my husband 's name as he was fully employed at the time. The title was in both of our names as well. 
Since his passing, I have been making all of the mortgage payments, my name is on the deed as the Surviving Spouse, and, I am the Executor of my husband 's estate. 
I can not qualify to assume the loan, as my credit score is low ... ..during my husband 's illness our financial situation worsened and I went into debt with a few credit cards. I am XXXX and my financial situation and business situation has been improving and I am attempting to pay off the credit cards. 
Bank of America has told me that to allow me to assume the loan would be "" preditory lending. '' Another comment from Bank of America is that in the past they would have been able to allow me to assume the loan, but they no longer can. 
All the payments I have been making are my checks, signed by me, but the loan account remains under the Estate of my husband, I would like to assume the loan and hopefully be able to then apply for some hardship program after the death of my husband. Maintaining the current payments at 4.9 percent is very difficult for me, and if my interest rate could be adjusted I would be most grateful, but I do not know how to go about it. I would have paid off the credit cards sooner, but I have had serious expenses related tot he house : last year the septic system had to be replaced, this year the well system has to be worked on. I really do want to maintain the integrity of the property, as I have lived here 30 years and have raised my children here and it was both mine and my husband 's hone, but I do not see which way to turn.

Mortgage,"I believe Bank of America ( BoA ) is mishandling my escrow account and the monies I have deposited therein for payment of my homeowners insurance and property taxes. They are notifying me I have no homeowner 's liability insurance. I do have such insurance ; the premium is paid by BoA from my funds held in a BoA mortgage escrow account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received urgent phone calls from an agent for BoA stating that I do not have homeowner 's liability insurance. On XX/XX/XXXX I called BoA and spoke with a BoA agent who told me the certificate of coverage issued to me by my insurance carrier as proof of coverage would not suffice as proof of coverage, and that BoA required a copy of the policy itself. I told him the policy itself does not show a coverage period or any premium information, and that in my years of defending residential foreclosures in state court the certificate of coverage or binder was the only documentation BoA would accept as proof of coverage. I gave him my insurance agent 's contact information. On XX/XX/XXXX I faxed him an 8-page letter with attachments including my 'continuation notice ' from my insurance company. ( Attached here. ) I filed a complaint with the NYS Department of Financial Services ( DFS ). BoA has called and written to notify me they received the DFS complaint and are investigating. I have since received a notice, not a bill, from my insurance company stating the premium is due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I changed insurance carriers in XXXX. BoA paid my old policy premium and a few weeks later paid my new policy premium. Shortly thereafter they notified me I had no insurance and threatened to purchase force placed insurance. I filed DFS and CFPB complaints. BoA notified me they would not bill me for force placed insurance. I know they paid my new, current, insurance carrier, because documentation I received from my carrier showed payment in full by mortgagee BoA. I was unable to determine if BoA handled my escrow funds correctly because they refused to provide plain-English documentation of payment of either premium. 

BoA needs to pay my homeowner 's insurance policy premium in full once a year and stop XXXX around with my escrow account."

Mortgage,I am currently having an issue with Bank of America regarding a modification that was processed without my permission or signature. I have contacted them but I am not receiving any assistance and they have not returned my call. I was at time of origination the primary borrower. The home was awarded to my spouse via divorce decree and I was told upon signing a release deed that was prepared the loan would be modified and my name removed. I was not provided a copy of the modification for review or signature. Upon. A recent credit check I am now aware m name is still on the mortgage and I have been told my the account rep from Bank of America that their policy does not require all responsible parties to sign the modification. My understanding is that any change in original repayment terms require all responsible parties to sign and acknowledge. Can you help me?
Mortgage,"Bank of America kept the loan payoff I did for someone. Bank of America has had the loan holders written permission since XXXX to look into this matter. 

Instead of looking into the matter, the bank hired lawyers to lie to judges faces to cover this up. 

When I payoff someone's bills or loans I have local police keep a copy. I have the copies the XXXX Police department had on file. 

CFPB Bank of America keeping the loan payoff has nothing to do with the loan holder. 

The loan holder couldn't make Bank of America do anything with the payoff I sent. 

Not once has Bank of America said why it didn't send the payoff back to me. 

Not once has Bank of America said why it didn't apply the payoff I sent to loan."

I paid all of my payments and had never been late on a payment. I am enclosing all of my documents that show this."
Mortgage,"Bank of America has a hidden fees of their mortgage program which didn't show anywhere, including their mobile app / website / mortgage statements. At the same time, their mortgage auto payment product didn't charge my checking account for the amount due they claimed. Instead, BofA report a payment past due record which currently impacted my credit score significantly for over XXXX ( from XXXX to XXXX now ). I'm here to provide more information about my situation. Really need your help on this matter. 

Timeline : 1. I had a mortgage with Bank of America for the last few years. I had the auto payment setup which linked to my checking account of BOA as well. It went well for the last few years. And I try to pay my mortgage faster than the original schedule. 
XXXX. On XX/XX/2022, I checked my mortgage and saw there is only {$1500.00} remaining on its balance. Thus I manually payed this amount via Bank of America from checking account to mortgage account. The amount was deducted from checking account successfully. 
XXXX. Since XX/XX/2022, the last three statements of my mortgage shows the total amount due is {$0.00}. Attached please find those statements. 
XXXX. On XX/XX/2022, the above amount still didnt apply and I noticed that my credit score got negative impact significantly. Bank of America report a "" past due ''. I checked with Bank of America via their customer support and was told that I need to pay {$140.00} additional fees to payoff the loan which was not showed anyway in app / website / statements. 
XXXX. On XX/XX/2022, I payed this amount via Bank of America from checking account to mortgage account. The mortgage got payoff and account got closed right after that. 

The problem is : ( XXXX ) if BOA need charge me those additional fees, why its system didn't charge via the auto payment which I always had enough balance. 
( XXXX ) Those additional fees didn't show anyway in their mobile app, website, even in mortgage statements? which I wouldn't know at all if I didn't noticed my credit score impacted. 
( XXXX ) I payed this mortgage way faster than the original schedule which caused a past due seems didnt make sense to me at all. 
( XXXX ) I contacted BOA and they refuse to accept that their product design is really confusing. The auto payment function didn't work properly. Their app/website/statements didn't give customer the right amount due information. 
( XXXX ) no alerts or messages at all."
Mortgage,"Bank of America is guilty of conducting Trustee 's Sales without the authority to do so. In this instance, Bank of America has failed to secure the XXXX Grant Deed with the subject property. Therefore, Bank of America and the current trustee, XXXX ( XXXX ), can not collect any existing debt through the sale of my home and private property. Furthermore, while there is evidence of an existing Grant Deed of XXXX through a recorded document, neither myself or Bank of America have been conducting transactions under ther terms of the XXXX Deed of Trust. Therefore, no default can be had or may be claimed on the XXXX Deed of Trust. Just to be clear, neither Bank of America or XXXX hold the power of sale under the XXXX Trust Deed in which the XX/XX/XXXX Notice of Default ( NOD ) and the XX/XX/XXXX Notice of Trustee Sale ( NTS ) has been associated with and recorded. And now, from this point forward, Bank of America and XXXX can not claim ignorance as to this fact and any action from this date forward will be fraudulent in nature and scope as well as evidence of a Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization ( RICO ) banking, mortgage, and real estate enterprising scheme intended to defraud honest, law abiding, and unsuspecting good folk of their homes. 

Trust Deed ( Deed of Trust ) is a written instrument by which title to land is transferred to a trustee as security for a debt or other obligation.

Trustee 's Deed is a Deed given by the trustee when property is sold under the power of sale in a trust deed. 

Since beginning the loss mitigation process with my request for mortgage assistance ( RMA ) in XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America has done everything to separate me from my home.rather than actually offer mortgage assistance as required and in accordance with the agreed upon court ordered terms of the National Mortgage Settlement ( NMS ). Bank of America continues to refuse to make the requested corrections of the errors made knoen to them during the loss mitigation process. 

All previously mentioned resolutions for the injury and harm caused are desired and mandatory.

Mortgage,"Approximately six weeks ago, I applied for a home refinance with Bank of America that required a fee of {$470.00} to conduct an appraisal. At the time, i was told that the fee would not be collected until the appraisal was done. My refinance was not approved and the appraisal was never done. In fact, the order with the appraisal company was cancelled. I made three written requests to my loan officer to get a refund of my appraisal fee during a period of two weeks, and there was no response to my request. I have an email from my loan officer promising a refund if the appraisal is not done, but he has subsequently ignored my requests for the refund. 

The purpose of my claim is to get the promised refund of {$470.00} for the appraisal that was never done. 

Attached are XXXX supporting documents. The first is the set of disclosures for the loan. The second and mroe relevant document is a diary of all of the emails between me and my loan officer that show my numerous unanswered requests for a refund of the appraisal fee, the pormise from the loan officer that I would get a refund if the appraisal was not done, and the acknowledgement that the appraisal was not done."
Mortgage,I would like to have Bank of America return the {$1000.00} early payoff fee that they charged my husband and I when we refinanced with another bank and closed out the HELOC loan with Bank of America on XX/XX/2016.

Mortgage,"Filed previous case regarding Bank of America Home Loan # XXXX does not respond to the consumer regarding lending practice, and or questions protected by the Truth in Lending regulations and the standard Federal Reserve policies. Again the same issue as the XXXX previous complaints is each time the bank responds to our requests for information the specific questions asked are not addressed. Then when that is pointed out via certified mail the bank sends letters for a while with a new Resolution Specialist each time extending the date a resolution should be received. So they acknowledge there is a valid issue to address but they need more time. Then the same as the entire process with the mortgage sold from Countrywide and was a bad loan Bank of America has not responded to modification documents for four years on and off. They have lied in writing and on the phone on notified recorded calls. Again the last response was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 copy attached to this complaint stated a resolution would be received by XXXX XXXX, 2016. That date has come and gone. There has been another XXXX documented and recorded phone calls and certified mail requesting an update. All have never been responded to. If I have to file multiple complaints for the same issue that there is no promised response from my lender this system is not helping the consumer. I have filed a complaint with XXXX XXXX XXXX, my Senator and Congressman and the Federal Reserve as well as the Attorney General.

I am a single mom and am trying to do everything possible to save my home. I feel as if Bank of America is pushing me into foreclosure on purpose. I do n't even know what my SPOC sounds like because he has not XXXX contacted me. The craziest part of it all is that if your SPOC is n't available, their policy is that NO ONE else can assist you.

Mortgage,"Ref # XXXX, Due to Bank of America incompetence 's I can not used my XXXX credit XXXX This morning I placed an order for an item and my purchase was declined. Not due to any fault of my own. 
Yesterday I received a phone call from a bank representative informing me that my complaint was assigned to her, and I will not receive a response from her until XX/XX/2022. Your website states that a company has 15 days to response to a complaint. I am being penalized due to no fault of my own and my credit report will be impacted due to bank of America careless. I have waited since XX/XX/2022 through XX/XX/2022 and this issue is still not resolved. 
Neither the bank nor its representatives care that their non- action is affecting me negatively and they are not willing to do anything to resolve it. Where is the justice in this situation? I need to have this issue resolved immediately and a notice sent to the credit agencies to remove any derogatory reporting from chase bank from my credit report. I have a good credit report and score and should not be subject to any derogatory reporting. I further believe that because I am a XXXX customer, I am experiencing such bad service. As I have stated I have been trying to resolve this issue since XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2022, and now I am being penalized. If I was a white customer, would I have this problem?

Mortgage,"Good afternoon, I am writing you in hopes you can be of assistance in correcting this misuse of HAF funds by Bank of America.

My Mortgage Servicer Bank of America requested, received and applied my HAF California Mortgage Relief funds incorrectly.

Per Californias HAF program Plan submitted to the U.S. Treasury for approval the goal of this program is to bring California Homeowners mortgage 's to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status. Unfortunately that is not what happened.

I was approved for the California HAF program under the California Mortgage Relief Program. However, the funds requested by me to bring my Mortgage to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status {$24000.00} as of XX/XX/2022 had been changed to {$9800.00} by a representative of the California Mortgage Relief Program per my loan servicer BofA.

I had contacted both BofA and the CA Mortgage Relief Program numerous times to inform them of how important it was to have the correct amount funded to fully reinstate my mortgage to Current as my home was and is now again in a forclouser status.

However, I was not contacted back byeither party prior to funds being paid to BofA by the CA Mortgage Relief Program in the amount of {$9800.00} which was intended to bring my Mortgage to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status per the "" Congratulations on your approval, funding and funds being applied by your loan servicer to bring your mortgage to a fully reinstated Current status '' email I received from the California Mortgage Relief Program ( which it did not ).

My loan servicer Bank of America did not apply the total amount of funds recieved {$9800.00} to my principal balance as intended by California 's Mortgage Relief program.

Funds where applied : Principal Balance : {$7000.00} Interest : {$1900.00} Escrow : {$390.00} And held in Unapplied funds account : {$520.00}.

I believe this to be an intentional misuse of Federal Covid-19 CARES Act grant funds by Bank of America . I believe this intentional misuse of funds was committed by Bank of America so they could continue to proceed with the forclouser sale of my home. I believe that Bank of America did this against the intended purpose of the HAF program so they could profit off of the funds received from the California Mortgage Relief Program and then double dip into all the additional funds they will receive on the forclouser sale. I believe Bank of America Intentionally misinformed the CA Mortgage Relief Program of the amount needed to bring my mortgage current and then intentionaly misused those funds intended to bring my home to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status. Leaving my XXXX XXXX veteran husband and I in desperate need of assistance again. 

I have sent a Notice of Error to Bank of America and a email to the California Mortgage Relief Program with no response received.

Thank you in advance for all of your assistance, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX If needed please contact me at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX"
Mortgage,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to report a serious issue that I have with my mortgage lender. On XX/XX/2021 after a discussion with the Loan Processing Officer, XXXX XXXX, XXXX # XXXX from Bank of America I decided to apply for a mortgage refinancing. One of the major financial incentives to apply was the fact that I could go through a XXXX process, with which I could avoid paying the transfer tax, an amount of {$14000.00}. After waiting more than three months to complete the XXXX process, Bank of America informed me that we are ready to close the loan and the sent me the Closing Disclosure, where there is a charge of {$13000.00} for the transfer tax! Two weeks ago I had contacted their legal counsel who was handling the XXXX process and they had informed me that my file was clear. On XXXX when I first talked to the above loan officer, he had told me that I will not have to pay the transfer tax since we are proceeding through XXXX. Today I am charged not only with the transfer tax but also with all the legal fees for the XXXX process. I feel I have been deceived and I would like your help to investigate this case. 

Thank you in advance, XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"Since last year, BoA has refused to work with my family concerning a loan modification after our family suffered death in the family, and was trying to keep our home by working with XXXX Prosperity Program. BoA continuously lost submitted paperwork, ignored HAMP applications and chose to foreclose on us. For the past 6 months, reinstatement requests have been Repeatedly submitted, yet before today, 8 days before our scheduled foreclosure, we have received only two. One, 3 months ago or so, that was well expired upon receipt of it, and today, which also expired today. Why can not BoA provide a reinstatement quote that allows at least a week before it expires? They will not accept anything but the exact amount, so how can I give that unless we have a non-expired quote. Just as bad, BoA is hitting us with late fees, inflated late fees, that would not have been present had they properly serviced our mortgage and given reinstatement quotes on time. It took months and Repeated attempts to even get the 2 we have the past 7 months. Attempts were made each month, yet it appears BoA purposely failed to service our mortgage, so they could bill outrageous late fees and add to their profit at a foreclosure. This appears to be mortgage servicing fraud ; the reinstatement quotes were ignored and sent belatedly, and now they are foreclosing at a high profit. A BoA rep even advised us NOT to attend a foreclosure hearing. How wrong is that? Is that not fraudulent or at least predatory? Also, at a hearing, where I tried to get the court to order a reinstatement quote, which is why we finally got the one today, I asked BoA ; XXXX attorney for a reinstatement quote and he said he would get me one that week. He never did. I have tried earnestly to get one but they seem intent not to give me one in time. It is a scam to delay, tack on late fees, send expired quotes, and then foreclose with "" added fees. '' That is unethical and wrong. That is mortgage servicing fraud. I could have reinstated 7 months ago, and far cheaper without the bogus late fees that have been added to my account. Do they not have a duty to give me adequate time and a non-expired quote in a reasonable period of time, not 3 months after the fact?"
Mortgage,"Loan # XXXX Bank of America Home Loan, I XXXX XXXX, I submitted all of my paperwork to Bank of America for a Modification review. I spoke with my customer relationship manager on XXXX, XXXX 2018. She specified I submitted all of the correct paperwork to to finish my modification review, now I am waiting on The Appeals Department with Bank of America to send me a answer on the paperwork I faxed over to them almost 2 weeks. This is so frustrating to me. I need to keep my home. I have submitted everything the Bank has asked for and now still waiting on a answer with the Appeals Department. Whats else do I need to do? I did everything possible. I have sale date on my home for XX/XX/2018. I been working with XXXX also, and they are helping me also with this process. XXXX"
Mortgage,"This is in association with complaint # : XXXX I had completed fully a modification trial period with Bank of America. I met all conditions of the trial, including making all 3 required trial payments on time. I was told in writing that at the time I finished the payments I would receive a modification package with all the terms and conditions and that my loan would be brought current. I expect that that is the current status. However in the interim Bank of America sold my loan to XXXX as trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The servicing company is XXXX XXXX TX, XXXX XXXX. 
I contacted your office this date as I have received no response to my prior complaint other than Bank of America is looking into the matter and needs more time. I have no time as these payments are time sensitive. I have contacted Bank of America and been told my loan was transferred on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to the new carrier and they can not accept payment nor advise me of any terms of my previously agreed modification. I also contacted the new carrier and been told that they do not have my information in their system. I am at a loss as to how I can be placed into this situation and their not being a required guideline for the bank to adhere to their agreed loan modification as clearly stated in their letter. I have complied with all terms required and am now in a position of not having a contractual agreement as promised nor anyone who can tell me what I am required to do or when. 
I have a letter from Bank of America stating they can not accept my payments after XXXX/XXXX/2016 and I should pay XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has no information on my loan as stated in my conversation today with XXXX Employee XXXX who stated they have no information in their system on my loan. I have been placed in a position of it being impossible for me to do anything. I am awaiting complete loan modification documents to move forward as agreed by Bank of America however at this time I can do absolutely nothing other than attempting to guard myself from forclosure by documenting my complaints with your agency. We are also exploring the good possibility that this loan was preditory and the documentation for the initial loan may be flawed. 
I have attached the following documents : 1 : Letter from Bank of America dated XXXX/XXXX/2016 referencing the modification stating that "" when completed successfully, WILL result in your loan being brought currentand will qualify you for an extension of your home equity account ''. It goes on to state I will receive a confirmation letter and my loan will be brought current. I have received nothing to date and have made all payments under the trial period as well as provided all documentation required by Bank of America. I do not anticipate having to do anything further as I have complied with a written agreement from Bank of America and it was their decision to sell my loan and the decision of the purchaser to purchase such for which they should have full knowledge of the circumstances at hand. 
2 : Letter from Bank of America stating thay have no answere at this time and will atempt to respond by XXXX/XXXX/2016. This after a possible payment date for which I have no place to pay. 
3 : Letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2016 NOTICE OF SALE OF OWNERSHIP OF MORTGAGE LOAN all company information is included in this letter yet I am still as of this date XXXX/XXXX/16 not id the XXXX system nor can get any information on my status whatsoever. 
4 : Letter from Bank of America stating notice date of XXXX/XXXX/2016 yet received on XXXX/XXXX/2016 by mail, very interesting. It tells me what to do and what has occurred, yet noting in this letter has occurred nor can I get any information on such form either Bank of America nor XXXX. 
Please help I am at a loss. I have done everything required."
Mortgage,"I would like to file a complaint against Bank of America and XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX we approached our mortgage lender Bank of America ( BOA ). We wanted to refinance our home that we have lived in since XX/XX/XXXX. At the time we approached BOA we were not in foreclose, we were current on all of our loan payments and we were not in distress. BOA turned us down for a conventional refinanced mortgage loan but offered us what they explained was a NEW program for customers that were current with their mortgage but wanted to reduce their payments. We were excited about the new program unknowing that it would hurt our credit and put our home into a foreclosure situation. Our loan officer said we were accepted into the program and our payments were being reduced approximately {$540.00} per month. We were told to make this payment for three months and the new loan would be in place after that. We asked our loan officer if the mortgage came back unacceptable could we refuse it, pay back the difference and keep the original mortgage. Our loan officer reinsured us that we could do this without penalty or credit damage. After three months past, we contacted BOA ; Our loan officer informed us that it was taking longer than expected but to keep paying the monthly mortgage at the reduced rate. 
After the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th months BOA keep giving us the same story, it was taking longer than expected, it 's not you ( the homeowner ) but the bank that is having issues with the paperwork, BOA instructed us to keep paying our scheduled reduced mortgage and the contract will come soon. It was on the Ninth month that the new mortgage plan finally came. The new mortgage plan was a disaster and we went from a 23 year mortgage to a 40 year mortgage with a balloon payment at the end. 
For obvious reasons we refused this new mortgage plan and continued with the existing mortgage. We never signed or entered into any new agreements that BOA or XXXX provide. No acceptance to their terms or conditions was accepted. It was only after refusing the new mortgage that BOA destroyed our credit and sold off our mortgage to XXXX. Once XXXX took over the loan it went downhill from there. XXXX would not discuss any terms or help us with the issues that BOA left us in. We paid large fees to XXXX that they forced us to pay to keep our home out of foreclose. All during the time while this was happening I still made my monthly payments on time, and every month with documentation of every payment. XXXX is a debt collecting company and they also duplicated bad credit reporting from BOA. 
I 'm attaching a letter from Ice Legal to BOA as evidence of my complaint ; I 'm also attaching a letter from BOA saying that they would partially correct our credit report and that it was done in error. Also I have requested a payment history on all payments made to BOA and XXXX. To this day I have not received any payment records nor have they corrected the errors on the XXXX credit reporting bureaus I 'm requesting that BOA and XXXX correct and remove all of the damaging information that 's on all three credit reporting bureaus. The dates and information that they are reporting are wrong and should not be there in the first place. BOA and XXXX knowingly and willingly took advantage of us and should have never offered us a loan that would cause us harm to our credit and possible foreclose to our home. I believe what BOA did was illegal and misleading, and there actions should be investigated. How many other hard working customers have they purposely for sole purpose only destroyed their credit and tried to take their home? I have personal bank records that show the history that I have made every loan payment including the trial payments on time from the beginning of the loan XX/XX/XXXX.

Mortgage,"I am requesting your assistance with a Deed In Lieu issue I am currently experiencing Bank of America. Due to my getting conflicting information on the Deed In Lieu process with BOA, I am asking that any foreclosure be stop until my issues have been resolved. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with the Deed In Lieu department initially stated to me that I qualified for a Deed In Lieu HAFA process and my second mortgage lender would be eligible for {$6000.00} to help towards settling any out standing balance with XXXX XXXX and I would be eligible for relocation amount of {$3000.00}. On XXXX XXXX. a XXXX XXXX, Deed In Lieu Specialist contacted me. She stated that I needed to provide BOA with a payoff balance from XXXX XXXX and now XXXX XXXX eligible for amount 6 % off of the principal balance or up to the XXXX balance. I then informed XXXX XXXX how much the principal balance was {$43000.00} owed to XXXX. She stated that BOA would offer {$2600.00} to XXXX XXXX instead of {$6000.00} and the relocation amount would be {$2000.00} instead of XXXX. I told her what XXXX XXXX XXXX had stated to me regarding both XXXX and my HAFA eligibility as it relates to principal balance and relocation amounts ; and that I had already informed XXXX regarding {$6000.00}. XXXX XXXX stated that BOA 's Deed In Lieu process would take up to 90 days and BOA has a settlement agreement with DOJ that states borrowers can only get {$2000.00} or {$7500.00} for relocation amount. She would first have to get an inspector out to look at the property. I informed XXXX XXXX that I had to move back into the home due to squatters break into my home twice and on one occasions setting a fire on my back deck. Due to my health, I was unable to maintain the lawn. XXXX XXXX stated to me that I did n't have to worry about cutting the lawn because Bank of America source out a business that cut and maintain lawns on their behalf. An inspection was scheduled for Thursday XXXX XXXX, 2015 at XXXX ; however, after waiting for an hour and half on the day of my inspection, I had to call XXXX XXXX to what happen to the inspector. Once the inspector XXXX XXXX arrived at my home, he informed me that he had fallen asleep and forgot about the appointment. When XXXX XXXX finished inspecting my home he informed me what need to be done before the Deed In Lieu process can be completed. He stated to me that I needed to remove all personal items inside the home, clear all debris, and cut the lawn. I told XXXX XXXX what XXXX XXXX stated to me regarding cutting the lawn. On Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 while attending an event, I received a call from XXXX XXXX stating he forgets to get me to sign the inspection papers from Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2015. I explained to him that I was out of town and would n't be back until later ; however, he could email them over to me. XXXX XXXX asked me to text him my email address. When I did not hear from XXXX XXXX, I text and sent him an email.The next day I received a strange email that I thought was from XXXX XXXX asking what information he forgot to provide me. So, I had to remind him about our conversation on Saturday. Afterwards, XXXX XXXX wife informed me that it was her.On Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2015, XXXX XXXX called telling me that there again she is denying my Deed In Lieu request because the back steps on the deck needed to be fixed. Even though XXXX XXXX the inspector does n't reference anything about back step to my deck that needed to be fixed in his report. What XXXX XXXX just brought this issue to my attention on Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 and the inspection was XXXX XXXX, 2015. When I ask XXXX XXXX for copy of the revised inspector'contract, she stated that she was n't sure if she could. I very confused about what Deed In Lieu process XXXX XXXX is following because I have two inspection reports alre"
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX I passed the MLO test to become a mortgage loan officer. After I applied to the NY State Department of Finance for my license they came back and said that there was a charge off from Bank of America from XXXX on my credit report. In order to get approved and obtained my license I need a letter from Bank of America with my account number on it that states this loan is paid off or I am working to resolve this issue. I have been calling Bank of America since XXXX in order to obtain this letter. Because the account was charged off in XXXX no one can pull the account so I get transferred to someone who can pull the account up in their old system. When I speak to that person they tell me that the account is closed and already paid off and they will submit the request for the letter. I have not received a letter. I have sent in written requests for the letter and never received a response. One representative told me that I needed to start making payments. I told them I was willing to set up a payment plan and they said we don't do that. I then said what if I make a {$1000.00} payment can I have a receipt or letter showing that I am working on resolving this issue, they tell me no we don't give receipts. I was also able to obtain the lien release from the State of New York. When I tell Bank of America I have a copy of the lien release they tell me yeah we see it but I can't help you. I have been transferred to every department, I have 13 different case numbers. When I give them all the case numbers they say they can't see them that I must have made these requests online. I tell them I have never submitted a request online and I give them names of people I speak with. They tell me "" well we are all over the country so I don't know ''. If I do get someone who can see my account they tell me that they see the lien has been paid off they have the lien release and oh you will get a letter in 24 hours. I still haven't gotten the letter. The account is closed, the lien has been paid. I had 90 days to get this letter and my time is running out. I have spent hours on the phone, written multiple letters and Bank of America will not help me."
Mortgage,"Flood Insurance over charge. Every year Bank of America sends me an Flood Insurance update XXXX in XXXX XXXX for renewal purposes. It is always a hassle, they send me an OPT OUT letter which allows me to only have flood insurance coverage on the amount of balance owed. Getting them to honor it is very difficult. Last year they had the amount incorrect and refused to correct it. I sent back the letter with a copy of my statement showing I only owed them XXXX NOT XXXX. When I called them, I was told several times "" oh yes we will get that fixed ''. I requested paperwork in writing over and over, it never arrived. They drug it out past the "" renewal window ''. I had a XXXX call with BOA and XXXX which got very heated. BOA "" bank of America '' said it was Insurance company so we then got her on the phone as well. BOA still insisted and XXXX was amazed by the ignorance of BOA, but it was to late and I was denied by XXXX in reduction of coverage because the bank refused to correct the paperwork in a timely manor. BOA was sued recently for placing lender based insurance on there loans. This was before my new troubles with them so I did n't join the class action law suit. They have managed to get me the last two years. Now my payment is approx. XXXX more than it should be due to the extreme amount of flood insurance they selected for me! I believe the new "" amount owed '' error is not an error and it is there new way of getting away with the over charging of there customers. Previously it took several heated calls to get them to honor the OPT OUT letter. its so aggravating and unfair of BOA the lender to treat the customer this way."
Mortgage,Bank of America called me numerous times in XXXX. I receive a call yesterday at XXXX. A BOA representative called me to ask fo R mortgage payment. I asked him what I owed. He then saw that I didnt owe. He then went onto my account and undo my payment. Confirmation number is XXXX. The bank is to be allowed to take advantage of the black Community again. Now I am here left to watch my pile of miss payments because the BOA representative went into my account. That was illegal I did not invite him into my account.
Mortgage,"My Name is XXXX XXXX ( aka XXXX XXXX ) and I applied for a mortgage through Bank of America with lender XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, he asked for my credit card to pay for the appraisal. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX I texted XXXX and said that we want to put the appraisal on hold because we were not sure whether we are moving forward with the home loan because there was a possibility that my husband 's grandmother would need to move in with us due to COViD and we were going to put the home buying process on hold. A On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that BofA charged my credit card {$840.00} ( the charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX ) for an appraisal. I called XXXX and asked for a refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a credit on {$120.00} from BofA. I called XXXX again, he said that they probably did a drive by appraisal and that's why they may have refunded me some of the money, but he's not sure. He said he would look into it for me. 
After going back to XXXX several times, I received a 2nd credit on my card fro {$1.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, which seems like a very odd amount. 

I realized that XXXX was unable to get my refund so I called BofA directly. I was passed around and disconnected several times-no one knew who could help me. After 2 hours, someone was able to give me the process server 's name-XXXX XXXX. They reached out to XXXX on my behalf. I did not hear from XXXX so I reached out to her. XXXX then private messaged me and said the appraisal was completed and any further questions should go to XXXX. That was all she said. I asked when the appraisal was done, but she never responded to me. 
I reached out to XXXX again, he said that the executive director was very angry with him and told him they completed the appraisal and will not return my money. XXXX said the director blamed him for the mistake. XXXX said he got in "" a lot of trouble ''. He told me he didn't know if the appraisal was done. 

I messaged XXXX again and asked her when the appraisal was done, why I never got a copy of the appraisal and why the refunded me {$1.00} but she doesn't respond. She diverts my emails to XXXX XXXX stating XXXX will answer my questions. 

I spoke with XXXX today. He said he cancelled my appraisal on XX/XX/XXXX and it seems the appraisal was ordered by BofA on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX said BofA received the appraisal on XX/XX/XXXX. He said he cant help me any further. 

I never received a copy of the appraisal. BofA will not tell me why they refunded {$1.00} and they are not responding to my private messages either. 

I have filed a dispute with my credit card too. 

The loan # is : XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"I am disputing Bank Of America 's reply to my last complaint. They say thatbecause I signed the loan papers, that showed that I fully agreed to it 's provisions. 
However, because I trusted BOA to provide accurate info, I did not have accurateinfo on my home 's value until I was able to do more research later. I was surprised to findto find the house had been appraised about for about {$100000.00} more than it'smarket value. Also, it took about XXXX years to get a copy of the XXXX appraisal. 
This considerably increased the cost of the loan and made it impossible to sell thehouse. I am still asking for compensation as originally requested."
Mortgage,"In regards to first complaint, things are astronomically worse if you can even comprehend that ... please see below : I have tried NUMEROUS times to modify my home mortgage loan with Bank of America. After my home loan conception with Countywide, BOA did in fact start my home loan modification and it took it over 3 years and now they are CONSISTENTLY requesting documents I 've sent them MULTIPLE X MULTIPLE TIMES!!! They continue to say I 've filled them out incorrectly, specifically my XXXX ... but I know I 've filled it out CORRECTLY. They finally sent out a Representative many times to collect and notarize the document that "" they filled out, I signed and they took with them to turn in '', each time I was promised it was correct. To turn around ... BOA says it 's incorrect!!! What do I do?? BOA is about to foreclose on my home come XXXX, XXXX, 2016 and wo n't work with me, offer help or clarify what they need. When they tell me what they need, I submit, then "" my case worker '' calls me rudely every time and asks me for them same thing again every time!!

Things have not only gotten worse but escalated beyond my control and I need HELP PLEASE! Anyone, anything! Should I call the news?

Mortgage,On XX/XX/20 my house was broken into. My door was completely destroyed. I called the police and made a report since I have cameras everything including the 2 guys is on video and has been given to the police. I noticed a sticker that had been left that said my property was determined vacant and if it's not vacant to call XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called them asking questions that they didn't want to answer but they did tell me they sent the 2 men out because Bank of America told them to. The 2 men apparently thought my property was vacant. When they broke in and found out it wasn't they reported that to XXXX XXXX. That's why when I called they said they knew it wasn't vacant. Just for the record Bank of America knew my property wasnt vacant. It doesnt even look vacant.
Mortgage,"To Whom It May Concern : Last year I obtained a home mortgage through XXXX which was financed by Bank of America. I qualified for the XXXX no down payment, no closing cost home loan. 
I closed on my home on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX handled the closing for Bank of America and XXXX. Because of the XXXX program requirements I was not able to choose my own title company and had to use XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX when I attempted to make my normal mortgage payment of {$1400.00}, I noticed online my payment went up to {$1600.00}. When I called Bank of America they told my escrow account was short. I immediately reached out to my real estate agent and asked her to review my documents to see if this was correct as I am a single father of XXXX and the increased payment is causing a hardship on my family. 
My real estate agent reached out to XXXX XXXX, they advised they did not collect enough escrow at closing ; however, upon further review by my agents title company it came to light that XXXX XXXX never escrowed for School Taxes. They only collected escrow for property taxes. When we reached out to the School Taxing authority for XXXX township they told us the School Tax bill was available in XXXX of XXXX. 
When my agent reviewed my escrow analysis she noticed after I closed on my home on XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America disbursed {$3700.00} in school taxes in XX/XX/XXXX. At that point my escrow account when short but Bank of America did not notify me until XX/XX/XXXX. 
I find this despicable and abusive on Bank of America, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. No one is trying to fix this mistake. I called Bank of America to file a complaint but they closed it out without resolving, then they told me to write a letter!? 
When my agent told XXXX XXXX they needed to correct this, they told her via email it was the Lenders fault for not escrowing. We have all of the communication in writing.

Mortgage,"Mortgage Servicing Fraud refers to a variety of abusive servicing practices that may occur individually or collectively to a loan after it has closed. Mortgage servicers are usually a third-party company hired/contracted by the lender/note holder to perform the day-to-day tasks associated with collecting loan payments. Some of these practices include, but are not limited to : * Manipulating the accounting of loan to appear in default despite being current.

* Refusing to accept properly tendered payments.

* Charging fees for collection letters, inspections and BPOs.

* Charging interest in excess of that actually owed.

* Placing payments into suspense accounts without cause.

These activities appear to be more commonly encountered by borrowers with equity in their property, regardless of their prime or sub-prime status. 

When it comes to mortgage servicing fraud, these wrongs are usually committed by third-party companies that hold neither title nor interest in the properties whose loans they service. Most commonly these days, servicers are employed by owners of Residential Mortgage Backed Securities or XXXX trusts. Mortgage Servicing Fraud stems from fairly boilerplate language used in the Pooling & Servicing Agreements that govern the relationship between the trust and the mortgage servicer. 

For instance, many Pooling & Servicing Agreements allow servicers to keep assumption fees, modification fees and basic late fees as what is known as "" additional servicing compensation ''. Language such as this simply removes any incentive for a mortgage servicer to keep a borrower current in their monthly payments because to do so potentially cuts the servicer 's profit margin significantly. There are additional means for servicers to make additional profit in servicing securitized loans but this is the most basic means of profit after the relatively small monthly servicing fees that servicers contractually agree to as a rule. 
As far as why a company would do this, the answer is both simple and yet complex. It all comes to down to money. For years consumers have been duped into believing that defaulted loans and foreclosure are not profitable for "" the bank '' when, in some instances, it is absolutely more profitable than allowing the borrower to pay off his/her loan especially when taking into consideration the various manners of insurance and/or investment "" shorting '' and/or "" hedging '' in which both note holders and servicers are allowed to engage by Our Home Purchase, Our Home Servicing, All 13 Banks involvement has n been recorded the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as fraudulent activity yet we are still fighting Foreclosure of our property 4 Law Firms rotating the foreclosure processing as we continue to make a plea for help by government entities such as CFPB, OCC, SEC, Veteran Administration.and onward.

My mortgage lender is Bank of America. Everytime I have asked them to refinance the loan, they say that my debt/income ratio is high and they can not do it. 

That is ridicules since for the past 9 years I have been able to make my payments at 5.75 % rate and they tell me that I do n't qualify to make the payments at 3 to 3.5 % rates. 

Of course by delaying this matter for years they have benefited nicely by collecting 5.75 % on a good size mortgage."
Mortgage,"I went through XXXX & back trying to access a mortgage account with Bank of America for a beach cottage I purchased in XXXX  over 20 years ago. When I remarried my husband of 1 yr decided we should refinance both our properties. I trusted him so did not scour the papers I signed including adding him to the deed. It turns out he refinanced it for {$21000.00} more than I owed & removed my name from the loan which I learned XX/XX/XXXX when I tried to access the account. Because I was removed from the loan, BofA refused to give me access to the account without his authorization during the divorce process which apparently he never set-up. I finally got access to the account after months of begging & found all sorts of stuff. 
Our divorce was finalized XX/XX/XXXX and a legally binding settlement agreement reached which was signed by both parties and the judge in XXXX where I lived during my marriage. I am supposed to have full access to the cottage & bear all financial responsibilities in order to keep it & am obliged to sell or refinance it by XX/XX/XXXX. So I call BofA and explain the situation ( again ) & tell them about the legal agreement which was sent to them as instructed. They also said they needed a letter signed by my ex-husband which was sent along with the settlement agreement. 
They said they do not honor such legal agreements & that I still need my now ex-husband 's authorization to gain access. Furthermore, they've made it very clear that even with his authorization they will only give me access to the loan information via telephone - they will not allow me to go to the on-line account documents & other info related to the mortgage including an "" advance '' they paid to the Town of XXXX XXXX for an unpaid sewer assessment ( unbeknownst to me ) to the tune of {$5000.00}. It appears on the loan statements I saw in the past in a separate section so I know it's somehow connected to the mortgage loan and is likely still racking up ridiculous late fees as it appeared my ex- wasn't making regular payments. 
I have made every single payment on the monthly mortgage for this cottage since it's purchase in XX/XX/XXXX. I would like to understand WHY BofA can now deny me access when the property, the loan & all related financial obligations are now my responsibility per a legal settlement signed by the judge &  HOW they can require that my EX-HUSBAND 's authorization. I have attached the last monthly statement I was able to obtain in my ex-husband 's name as well as the divorce/settlement agreements. Nor do I understand how I can possibly comply with the terms of the settlement agreement and take care of all related bills & fees until I can SEE the records. 
Thank you in advance for your help."

Mortgage,I have a mortgage and home equity loan with Bank of America. I make all payments on line. I have been with them now for 18 years. I did try to solve this issue directly with Bank of America and was completely ignored. One month I must I paid a partial payment on my home equity and Bank of America never once called me or sent a letter to give me a reminder like the mortgage department as done even when it was only getting to the 16th day to pay the mortgage. I don't think it is fair to a consumer that they failed to notify their customer that a payment was due and to report it as late to the credit bureaus and to have a negative affect on my credit score. This would have been 1x in my entire relationship with Bank of America that I was late.
Mortgage,"Bank of America 's has damaged my home, charged me for services that they did not perform ( mowing grass, removing debris, etc ... ) and added the costs of these services to my mortgage balance.

Nothing was done. Instead, Bank of America 's law firm    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   sent m e a letter saying that Bank of America was not responsible.

Mortgage,"During the recession we were having trouble keeping up with our mortgage, so Bank of America offered us a option to help our situation thru the harp program. They took what we were behind in payments, added more to that for fees etc, and extended our loan to a 40 year mortgage. So now we find ourselves paying about the same payments that we were before only now much less of that money goes towards the principal. When you are facing loosing you 'd home, you will agree to terms that are not to your overall benefit."

Mortgage,On XXXX Bank of America stated that I was not eligible for the Bank of America Capitalization Loan Modification Program due to income not meeting program eligibility. The income calculated by Bank of America was {$17000.00} per month. Bank of America calculated PITA to be {$65000.00} ( {$5400.00} per month ). Yearly income calculated with an income of {$17000.00} per month would be {$210000.00} which clearly would cover the costs. Why was I refused the modification?

I've made a transfer to pay the mortgages this month and now can't log into the website to make the payments. As the attached says the system isn ' available to me - not generally unavailable, just to me!! 

I've made repeated attempts to call - and you should try it too - without an answer.

We asked for a loan from these XXXX banks because we have had accounts with them for many years and the B of A held the mortgage for our home. Now the Bank of America without our knowledge sold the mortgage to XXXX. In 2014 Bank of America lost the legal case they had with Department Justice, so in return they offered us a re modification on our loan. They broke the law again by hiding our monthly payments so that we could be considered late. We have paid our mortgages every month. They put this misinformation on our credit report. Secondly they put a lien on our house, which is a subordinate loan. We would hope that you would tell our story when talking about breaking up the Banks.

Mortgage,"Bank of America and their representatives, including XXXX XXXX, have engaged in the practice of distribution and sharing financial, personal, private, and privileged information contained within the borrower Home Loan Modification Status iportal, My Documents tab page with external users without my permission or consent. It is this long established Bank of America practice that has allowed for the destruction of documents and documentation related to my home loan mortgage account. 
This on-going conduct on the part of Bank of America and their representatives is, in part, the reason I have ha to lodge over sixty ( 60 ) CFPB Complaints regarding Bank of America 's handling of my home loan mortgage account records throughout the loss mitigation and modification processes and have been incorrectly denied a MHA HAMP, MHA HAMP TPP, and incorrectly forwarded to foreclosure. 
There is simply no way Bank of America can come up with an explanation for such errors in processing and handling upon complete and independent reviews of the mortgage and service records for which decisions are based and made. The whole reason for such reviews are to ensure any action taken on an account are based on the complete and current record resulting in accurate and correct decisions. This simply has not been the case in this instance throughout the modification and loss mitigation processes to date as evidenced by the multitude of errors in processing, procedure, law, regulations, and guidelines. In other words, these errors have not been due to Bank of America representative and employee lack of knowledge of specific procedures required in the performance of their duties."

Than sent a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX they are still doing their investigation and need more time. Bank of America has destroyed my life and all I am asking for at this point is relief. They no longer service my loan and even after their error and over {$50000.00} paid to them to bring my account current back during the refi process they still are harming me. I am a XXXX XXXX   XXXX veteran and there were programs I qualified for Bank of America never tried to help me access in the refi process. As stated in my original complaint. They never once reached out to my VA rep to help me save my home having a VA loan they were required to do that. 

Bank of America Timeframe During this complaint process : - I received a call from Ms. XXXX XXXX on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. During the phone call I told her that I was on travel and would not be able to talk in detail until Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. She told me the call was to update me and she would call me on XX/XX/XXXX. 
- On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX Ms. XXXX called me to inform me that Bank of America ( her ) was still investigating my complaint and parts of her review was with the department that handles credit reporting. She told me that she would be complete with her investigation in the coming weeks and she would call me once a week to keep me updated. 
- Bank of America Sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( in error ) stating they determined that they accurately reported my account to all four credit bureaus. They stated in their letter they completed their investigation and have confirmed the information. 
- Bank of America sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that Ms. XXXX XXXX had my complaint and was currently reviewing/investigating my complaint and more time was needed in the review process. The letter also stated Bank of America would contact me before XX/XX/XXXX and if not will keep me posted.

Mortgage,"As the attached screen shots from the Bank of America website show, I scheduled the mortgage payments in late XX/XX/2020 for XXXX XX/XX/2020 and have sufficient funds in the checking account for those payments. 

However, as of XXXX XX/XX/2020 BoA has not properly credited the payments. In my opinion, this is simply part of BoA 's consistent policy to provide poor service and then assess 'fees ' so they can steal, in my opinion, money from the customers. 

I would NEVER willingly do business with BoA ; BoA bought these mortgages and I have NO RECOURSE other than expensive refinancing to get rid of them. 

I've paid mortgages on my homes and rentals for over 40 years and the trouble I've had with BoA in the few years they've 'serviced ' these mortgages is greater than all the problems in the past 40 years. 

In my opinion, many of the senior people should be thrown in jail."
Mortgage,"The problem is with my escrow account. Because we were out of town and missed a short turn around letter from the bank. We were given a shortage amount to be paid. We were given a subsequent amount to pay which we did. The analysis said if we pay that amount we would pay the smaller designated amount {$1600.00}. However, that did not happen and we received a higher payment in the XX/XX/2019 statement. Since then we have received two more analysis and and three more statements with different amounts to pay. All of them increasingly higher asking us to pay more because this bank incorrectly planned for the following years tax payments. Now we are being asked to pay more ( {$1600.00} ) than we can afford per month. We are willing to do what we can but this bank is being very unreasonable. I tried to get the problem solved with help from the XXXX but that is useless because they assume no responsibility just want us to pay for their mistakes."
Mortgage,"I have had a very difficult time with Bank of America. I have tried to submit for a loan modification several times. I was never able to communicate to the same person which always caused confusion. Bank of America always seemed to lose my paper work, which I constantly had to re fax. 2015 we a very difficult year for my family. I lost my job, and went on unemployment. My wife was diagnosed with XXXX She was unable to keep her job as well. An unbelievable hardship for our family. I am now back to working full time with XXXX XXXX XXXX My wife now has XXXX income as well. Our family is now over our hardship and wants to keep our home. Bank of America has refused to help us with a modification and is forcing us into a bankruptcy."
Mortgage,"1. This date being XX/XX/XXXX my name is XXXX XXXX and I am the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, New York zip code being XXXX. This letter serves as a complaint against Bank of America my loan number being XXXX. In my CFPB complaint dated XX/XX/XXXX I had 3 concerns regarding the lender and although 2 out of 3 have not been sufficiently addressed and are debatable. One concern sets precedence over the other 2 concerns. The complaint stems from a response received by the institution in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX regarding the Additional Late Fee charge. The response letter indicated that according to my Note the institution is entitled to charge an additional fee. I retain no documents to reference the institutions claim. In addition, the institution responded in XXXX to the same complaint which is contradictory to their present response. Bank of America is charging Non Bona Fide Fees which is a violation of RESPA CFR 1024.35 ( b ) ( 5 ). In addition to late fees of {$12.00}. Bank of America forwards 2 notices each month requesting additional fees now totaling {$200.00}. ( SEE ATTACHED Notice ) 2. On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a complaint against Bank of America through the CFPB citing the Additional Late Fee charge. During this period the additional fees had totaled {$71.00}. Bank of Americas response was according to their records, my loan was due for the XX/XX/XXXX installment and is in default status. As of the date of the letter, my loan has not been referred to our foreclosure department. Their research indicates that two of the payments were received in XXXX did not include the total amount needed to cover the full monthly mortgage payment and/or the late fee. In addition, a table was provided to show breakdown of the monthly mortgage payment amount due, the amount required to cover the payment due including the late fee, the amount the bank received and shortage amount that was needed to fulfill the payment including the late fee assessed. 
( SEE ATTACHED CFPB Complaint, Banks Response, XXXX Late Fee Notice ) 3. In XXXX, Bank of America states within their response that in accordance with my note, if they dont receive sufficient funds before the normally scheduled installment due date including a 15 day graces period, the account will be considered past due. Their records reflect that monthly mortgage payment for the account has been received after the 15 day grace period several times, as a result, they have assessed late charges. In addition, they have respectfully declined my request to waive the additional charges. ( SEE ATTACHED Complaint Letter and Banks Response ) 4. Background : In or around XXXX original mortgage lender was XXXX XXXX. In or around XXXX Countrywide   refinanced my original mortgage. In XXXX Bank of America took possession of Countrywide XXXX XXXX and all of its accounts/customers. I retain 2 modification agreements with Bank of America. 

5. In closing : First, Bank of America was not my initial mortgage lender. Second, I initiated a complaint in XXXX and XXXX against Bank of America regarding the Additional Late Fee. In XXXX, the bank states 2 payments were received and did not include the total amount needed to cover the full monthly mortgage payment and/or late fee. In XXXX, the bank states that according to my Note they are required to charge an additional fee after the standard late fee has been paid. Third, we can ascertain the bank has 2 different versions on why they have been trying to collect an Additional Late Fee. Obviously, one version has nothing to do with the other.

6. In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America stated that I am paid through XX/XX/XXXX which conflicts with their response in XXXX ( SEE ATTACHED ). Currently, I am paid through XX/XX/XXXX. However fast forward to their response in XXXX, Bank of America stated according to my Note they are required to charge an Additional Late Fee. I am respectfully requesting Bank of America to provide a copy of the Note within their agreement which states the regulation regarding the Additional Late Fee that I signed, dated, and had notarized. Please be advised that I retain all documents from all mortgage lenders and or servicers. I have researched the banks response to their alleged Note that states I am required to pay an Additional Late Fee and as a result do not possess such documents. 

7. Therefore if I do not possess such copies of an agreement in my possession to reference that I am entitled to pay additional fees on top of additional fees or Bank of Americas agreement does not match my documents, then I am respectfully requesting Bank of America to disregard those charges. I am not asking for courtesy but rather what is lawfully feasible regarding this matter, if Bank of America is Really There to Help."
Mortgage,"I write this letter in great despair and fear. My home was wrongfully foreclosed and sold in auction by Bank of America.   I have been working with  XXXX   (    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  Tel (   XXXX  )  XXXX  ) to have my home loan modified to a lower payment.   On  XXXX   XXXX   2017, I received a  call from someone claiming to the vice president of Bank of America. She notified me to let me know that my appeal had been rejected. However, I did want to accepted because based on what she told me herself, my request was not reviewed as requested. I did not take the news well at all.   However, at the end of the phone call I was told by her that I can apply again for a loan modification if my circumstances had changed.   Since my wife was now working full time I sent all the information they requested by  XXXX   XXXX  , 2017. I   contacted them on  XXXX   XXXX  and  XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 via ph one and email letting them I had sent all the documents they had requested and asked them to inform me ASAP if the needed anything else. No one replied nor returned my calls.   On  XXXX   XXXX  Bank of America contacted  XXXX  letting them know the sell date of  XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 w as cancelled and there was no pending sell date. In turn  XXXX  contacted with the same information. The sell date cancellation was also reflected on the website  XXXX .   To my surprised and HORROR, I was then contacted over the phone on  XXXX   XXXX     2017 inf orming me that my home had been sold in auction earlier that day.   I did everything Bank of America asked of me. I followed their guidelines and rules. In turn, they steal my home. They steal my dignity.   I am desperate, I am horrified. I need help.   PLEASE HELP ME.   I contacted  XXXX . They can no longer assist me because now my home belongs to a 3rd party.   I contacted Bank of America and all they did was direct me their lawyer  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   (   XXXX   )   XXXX .   The new owner of my home is  XXXX    XXXX    XXXX ,  XXXX   Tel (   XXXX  )  XXXX  Please fight for me and my family.   Do n't allow Bank of America to lie and the steal my home Do n't allow Bank of America leave me and my family homeless."
Mortgage,"I recently submitted a request to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau case number XXXX XXXX # XXXX for help with my failed negotiations with B of A for a mortgage modification. My desired resolution was I would like to modify my loan in order to give the value of the home time to reach the purchased price. I did not want to have to miss payments to make this happen. I did not want to be foreclosed upon, sell the home short, or surrender the deed in lieu of foreclosure. The resolution from Bank of America was sent in a letter to my home address and not posted with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

I was refused assistance and referenced to the SHORT SALE as the program in which I was eligible. 

In my discussions with XXXX XXXX, Bank of American Resolution Specialist, Enterprise Customer Care Resolution, during the fact gathering period he stated that cash reserves or other liquid assets would be used as a factor when making the determination on modification when the customer was current on their mortgage. He also stated that cash reserves or other liquid assets would not be used as a factor when the customer was not current on their mortgage ( missed payments ). 

In addition, each time when discussing the above requested resolution with XXXX XXXX on the telephone I was told that my conversation would be recorded for quality and training purposes and that if I recorded the conversation he would have to politely end the conversation. I pushed the issue and asked if I would have access to these recorded conversations, he said no. I asked why, and he finally said after saying initially they were for quality and training purposes, that they were the property of Bank of American and could be used if needed for any future litigation. 

In addition during the fact gathering period XXXX XXXX stated that the decision was made by a computer and was totally objective based on new strict guidelines that did not allow subjective interpretations. I did question the length of time, 10 days for a decision, that it took for a computer to make the determination after all needed information was gathered, and neither he nor XXXX XXXX ( Bank of American Resolution Specialist, Enterprise Customer Care Resolution ) could explain why. XXXX XXXX offered to supply me with an address where I could write and ask, and did supply me with his supervisors name and number. 

Based on the information above I wanted to know if XXXX XXXX would run the computer program again, with the same financial facts other than the liquid assets and also indicate I had missed a payment. Since it was strictly an objective decision made by a computer I could get helpful information without having to suffer the financial punishments of missing a payment. I would then have the information needed to decide if I wanted to move forward. 

Lastly, the resolution letter dated XX/XX/2015 said I was eligible for the Short Sale, "" you do not meet the eligibility requirements to qualify for a loan modification, but you are qualified to pursue a short sale ''. In the "" Results of the Evaluation, What you are qualified for '' section it said in the section, A short sale without an offer, "" we will provide you with a recommended list price for the property '' and You will receive a letter in the next few days that explains the terms and conditions of this short sale program."
Mortgage,"I took out an equity line of credit from Bank of America to pay off ( 5 )  countrywide existing loans, which in turn paid them off in full from my main home which had no loan. The loan was {$350000.00} equity line of credit. It was very easy 11 years ago. The loan agreement was that after the 10 year term the loan would be converted to a new 30 year fixed loan. THIS did not happen and now the payment have increased to a 15 year variable loan. which in turn have increased my payment from {$800.00} per month to {$2700.00} per month. This was a scam by Bank Of America. They have refused me a new modified loan as they originally mentioned. I need to either find a new loan and join the class action lawsuit or file my own lawsuit against Bank Of America. They also have lowered my credit score by their continued inquiries from XXXX to XXXX. This HAS TO STOP. I need your help in this matter as soon as possible. I can be reached at XXXX or by email at XXXX or my backup phone is XXXX. I can be reached 24/7 .Thank you for your advice and help in this matter. 
Sincerely yours, XXXX XXXX retired on XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"I have a Promissory Note with Bank of America XXXX BOA XXXX that was cancelled in XXXX. After repeated requests for them to remove the lien on my property, BOA has not yet removed the lien ; nor have they responded to my requests. Furthermore, BOA is attempting to foreclose upon the property on behalf of XXXX using a non approved substitute trustee and foreclosure attorney XXXX XXXX with The XXXX Law Firm, who dismissed the foreclosure on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, withdrew from the case on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and now bringing back a XXXX Motion To Withdraw their voluntary dismissal. 
I seek your assistance in ending further extortion attempts by Bank of America and XXXX."
Mortgage,in regards to this previous case # XXXX. I just faxed the pervious paperwork the XXXX XXXX which she never called me back or told me that I was missing something. I faxed the paper work to her on XXXX2017. I am faxing you the same paper work and you will see that I did faxed them everything and even my pay stubs and banks statements to them. they keep saying that I do n't sent them the information but is false statements. they do n't answer their calls and they do n't even answer their mail and just at the last minute they make the customer wonder what is going on.
Mortgage,"My original mortgage is with Bank of America and on XX/XX/2020 I refinanced with a different company and a wire was sent on XX/XX/2020 to Bank of America to pay off the mortgage, with the correct routing number, mortgage account number, and the correct amount that was provided by bank of America ( info on payoff statement ), my correct name and address and the payment has not been applied. I have contacted Bank of America on 5 different situations and have spoken with multiple representatives whom 3 have stated that they will escalate the issue and it will be resolved within 24-72 hours ; the first  time I was told this was back on XX/XX/2020. When asked for a ticket/case number I was informed there was not one available. when I asked for a name, representative, or phone number of someone that I could follow up with directly, again I was told there was not one available. I then asked if they could put in a request to have someone  reach out to me to verify that it has been completed and I was told that was not available. This one call took over 3 hours total. I have since called other times ( XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 ) with the same responses and still nothing is being done. I am well over 6 hours of my time invested in trying to get this resolved via phone. I also submitted an email to Bank of America from their online website, with no respones.. Bank of America has me listed as being delinquent on my mortgage since they haven't processed my wire from XX/XX/2020 and my payment was due XX/XX/2020. We are coming u

p on 30+ days delinquent and I fear that my credit will be effected by this as well. I do not see how a financial institution is able to sit on a wire transfer without processing in a specific timeframe. Any Assistance would be GREATLY appreciated as I am becoming very frustrated and would love to get this resolved."
Mortgage,"This complaint is about Bank of America. They have not been reporting to the credit bureau 's on our mortgage. We were looking at my husbands credit score on XXXX XXXX and saw that our account with Bank of America has been closed since XX/XX/XXXX, however we have been paying them up until XX/XX/XXXX when they transferred our account to XXXX XXXX XXXX and we started making payments to them in XX/XX/XXXX and are currently making payments to them. They are a debt collector and we are in a modification with Bank of America. We tried to refinance but Bank of America is reporting us 30 days late for the last year. If you could do a complete review of my mortgage we would appreciate your help."
Mortgage,"Bank America is insisting a home buyer obtain a "" shared driveway '' agreement from a neighbor when in fact it is not a legally shared driveway. Of course the neighbor refuses, so the bank is refusing to grant the buyer a mortgage. Neighbor and Buyer have yet to meet compounding the problem of having any ( inocuous ) agreement of any kind. The Bank wants a recorded agreement that forces both the Buyer and Neighbor to lie and in spite of attorneys for both buyer and seller stating the legal truth and wrongness of their request, the Bank remains obstinant. What to do? Does a consumer have any recourse?"
Mortgage,"Dear Sirs, I have had 2 lines of credit with Bank of America since 2005. One is fixed and the other was variable. I have fully paid off the variable portion some months ago but during the process was never able to get a payoff amount for the variable portion. I pay my fixed rate portion on or before the XXXX of the month at the branch in cash and always pay additional toward the principal. I have been incessantly harassed by phone calls from Bank Of America stating that I have not paid my loan payment on time. I have repeatedly told them that I have the receipts but they tell me that the branch does not reflect the payment. This happens practically every other day and honestly I fear a sort of set up. they send me statements that I owe XXXX cents on the variable portion. I feel that this is totally in bad faith and that they are trying some sort of unseemly tactic. I feel harassed and harangued. I want to have my fixed HELOC vacated and damages awarded."
Mortgage,"B of A misapplied my early payments to principal paydown, then dinged me for late payments. Between XXXX/XXXX/15 and XXXX/XXXX/15, a CSR named "" XXXX '' advised they would fix it and told me to send in {$100.00}. Later B of A still hit me for a late fee and did n't fix it. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I requested a pay off demand. B of A had another late fee included in the payoff of {$130000.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/15. I complained and on XXXX/XXXX/15 I spoke with an XXXX at "" XXXX '' who said he would resolve my demand that they remove the {$38.00} late fee. B of A then re-issued the payoff demand on XXXX/XXXX/15 for {$130000.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX yes ~ {$180.00} higher! ) I called and complained. B of A ignored me. I spoke with a XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15, who said he would resolve the issue. He never did, i called and left about XXXX voicemail messages for him over the next 3-4 days and he never responded. I also left XXXX vm messages for "" XXXX '' who was purportedly XXXX ' supervisor at XXXX, he never called me back. I also left vm messages for "" XXXX '' at x XXXX, he never called me back. 

I spoke with an XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15 at around XXXX, she was unwilling or unable to resolve the XXXX {$180.00} problem. 

I was forced to overpay in the payoff demand, as the property was being sold. 
In addition, i made an inadvertant extra payment to B of A after the property was sold. 
I never received any accounting as to the overpayments and would like a full accounting. I received a check back but i believe this was only for the credit balance in the escrow account."
Mortgage,"- [ ] I went through XXXX to obtain a loan serviced by Bank of America. The home had mold and repairs that needed to be made so we had to go through a rehab procedure. XXXX says online, in literature, at the workshops and in person that there is never a fee for their services, no down payments or closing cost. We began working with them in XX/XX/XXXX and attended three workshops before our process officially began in XX/XX/XXXX and we finally closed XX/XX/XXXX. We had a closing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX but they could not get things done in time concerning the rehab cost etc. XXXX XXXX ( Rehab Dept ) Director kept changing the amounts after wed already accepted the bid which inflated our loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who manages the rehab process, took the inspection report and sent us what needed to be repaired. We were required to get a contractor to give us a bid and once we accepted it then we were to be cleared by XXXX and be able to close. After we agreed with the contractor and signed off, XXXX added things we didnt need like a new roof when the house had a new one and a basement build back that we didnt want or need. The rehab cost went from the {$38000.00} to {$47000.00} to {$57000.00} because the XXXX Director would take off the roof but fluff other numbers and so on. Even after we closed she tried to get us to sign off on a {$66000.00} rehab scope of work which I refused because of the trend of them going up and saying sign this if you want to continue. I found out later that XXXX XXXX XXXX gets a percentage of the final rehab cost so it now makes sense why she kept fluffing the numbers. We only used {$25000.00} though {$57000.00} was figured into our 30 year mortgage. They put around {$28000.00} towards our principle but a couple thousand is still unaccounted for ( {$57000.00} rehab minus {$25000.00} we actually needed to use minus {$28000.00} leaves a few thousand left over ). Then we found out nine months later they charged us the Rehab fee which is supposed to be paid by the lender. The Rehab fee is supposed to be 3 % of the Rehab ( {$57000.00} on one doc ) but they rolled {$1800.00} into our loan which is more than 3 %. Theres also a doc that says the rehab was {$50000.00} and {$1800.00} is still not 3 % of this fee we were never supposed to pay. We were always told the lender pays. When I asked about these discrepancies the Closing Manager, XXXX XXXX asked me, if you knew about the fee would you still have gone through with the loan? I said what does that have to do with anything then he scolded me and accused me of trying to get something from them. When we spoke before this I said I didnt understand the amounts and why we had to bring almost {$19000.00} to close when around {$9000.00} was points we purchased and we were not to pay a closing cost. Without our permission they held {$7700.00} for nine months ( gave me {$1.00} back in interest ). I was told later that due to the confusion at closing they needed to make adjustments and they had to do it that way. All along they say theres no down payment, closing cost and never a fee for their service. The {$7700.00} they held from cash to close overage was placed in the escrow holdbacks to go towards the rehab they said at a later date that we never pre-approved them holding. At one point  they asked for over {$20000.00} in cash to close since we had it in out account. This was decided by Mr. XXXX, the closing manager. There is a contingency of 10 % of the rehab cost which equals about {$5000.00} that got rolled into the loan to cover cost in the event we went over budget. When they surprised us and kept the {$7700.00} cash to close overage and placed it in an escrow holdback account the Rehab Director, XXXX XXXX said it was in case we went over the financed amount which is supposed to be what the 10 % contingency is for so they added an extra {$5000.00} to our loan in case we go over budget. The budget was {$57000.00} and then they felt it was okay to hold {$7700.00} of our money which would give us almost {$65000.00} for rehab and we only needed {$25000.00}. Then we paid out of pocket during the rehab for an HVAC system ( {$7000.00} ) and were not allowed to use our money they had, the {$7700.00} overage they were holding for rehab. I dont understand why our loan had to be inflated again with the contingency fee if they put our overage in escrow for the same purpose. I have been trying for almost a year to have my loan explained. The closing took around six hours after sending us to the bank to get {$22000.00} cash to close but the bank closed early on XX/XX/XXXX to honor the passing of president Bush which the realtor knew about but sent us anyway to buy time. When we returned he and the closing attorney had taken naps per the realtor. Then we were told and given a document saying we needed {$20000.00} cash to close. Mr. XXXX said they were working on the final numbers but in order to close that day we could give the {$20000.00} and Bank of America would cut us a check for any overage. We were asked to sign three different packets with different amounts for our loan and told they were working to straighten out the discrepancies with the lender. One email I received said theyll keep us posted and we were due back {$10000.00} of the cash to close. At one point we decided to leave and the realtor went to get Mr. XXXX and thats when we met him after waiting almost 4 hours we then stayed another 1.5 hours. After XXXX we we told to sign a few more documents and we could wire the money the following day, we just needed the closing date with wet signatures and they had six days to work it out. As we were driving away the closing attorney ran out to our car and had us come in to sign another document. My husband and I worked nights so after working the night before, driving an hour and a half to close, being bounced around for over six hours, driving back, going straight to work, working all night, staying up that next morning anticipating Mr. XXXX call with the final cash to close amount we needed to wire the bank, we finally got to sleep around lunch when Mr. XXXX called to say everything was official. He said he had emails about the overage which was around {$8000.00} ( should have been {$10000.00} ) and he would make sure we got it back. I finally went to sleep thinking we had our home and would be notified concerning the final amounts figured into our loan due to the we have 6 days comments. This never happened. When I was sent an email with the Closing Disclosure and told to sign it in order to close on time, I said the numbers were wrong and was told this was not final but they needed signatures to move forward. I received the email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX telling me to sign and return by midnight. I saw the email and signed but said it wasnt right. They close at XXXX and there was no one to go over this with me. I called our counselor who never responded to that call. For the next few days the closing coordinator kept sending the same document for me to resubmit because it wasnt legible. She said it was finally received two days prior to close. Then at closing this incorrect document was there for us to sign in our packet. I again said it was wrong and they began trying to fix things. It appears to me they jumbled a few rehab docs together, took out fees and rolled the rest into the loan. When my husband went to the snack machine, our realtor told me how good the loan was even with the discrepancies and I should sign it or the seller will walk. This was the experience the whole time. We were told one thing and railroaded into signing something else. We paid an inspection fee of {$550.00} that was to be credited back since its part of closing and they claim to have no closing cost and told us the lender would credit it to us. They also inflated the PITI which covers mortgage payments during the rehab by {$200.00}. So as it stands for the past two two months a rep from Bank of America has been in contact with XXXX  and had Mr. XXXX call to go line by line and explain what the numbers mean since that didnt happen at closing. When he would get to a point he could not explain, he scolded me and would end the call abruptly. For example, he began to explain the discount points we purchased and said, thats were you purchased seven points. I corrected him and said we only purchased six ( we were not allowed any more ) and he said I have an appointment and got off the phone. I have not heard from him or the Bank of America rep since then and it has been over three weeks. From my calculations we have a couple thousand that was taken from the cash to close that has not been explained and a few thousand unaccounted for that was rolled into the loan. The final loan amount is {$220000.00}. {$57000.00} rehab that was fluffed and rolled into the loan based on BOAs closing documents but about {$50000.00} that Mr. XXXX told me was actually used and in another loan packet. We had around {$19000.00} in cash to close that can not be explained. Ive asked for a breakdown of the escrow holdback and was told by the BOA rep that he would get that to me and had put in a request and thats when communication with him ended. The closing disclosure was changed and signed at closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I have asked since then for clarity. The best explanation I received was from XXXX XXXX Director. She once said it appears they submitted one rehab SOW but used another for the loan causing several thousand dollars difference and she said she would ask that the loan be reassessed. The next time I spoke with her ( after many calls and emails were ignored for along time ) to see if they would redo the loan she said there were no errors and threatened to end the relationship if I speak this way again. Mr. XXXX said he would give back the {$1800.00} plus the interest that I asked for which he said was {$2.00}. Also, the PITI that is rolled into the mortgage to cover the monthly payments while work is being done was not needed because the work took three weeks but they would not clear us to begin although they say work should begin within 30 days after the closing. I was told not to move in until the Director clears me to. They waited until the 5th month to allow the work to begin, didnt pay the contractor until the last month clearing us and we moved in after the PITI was used up. I feel this was strategic as they tried to get me to sign the {$66000.00} SOW that would have included the {$7700.00} overage and made the discrepancies make since. I refused and the back and forth struggle began."
Mortgage,"On  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , I submitted complaint #  XXXX , On  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX   Bank of America gave the appearance of responding and closed the complaint ; however, Bank of America did n't take the complaint seriously and in Bank of America 's response to us they provided old copies of their Attorney 's  XXXX  and  XXXX  's response to old complaints which never answered questions in previous complaints AND DEFINITLY DID N'T ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN THIS COMPLAINT. When I called Bank of America and asked them why they did n't take OUR complaint seriously BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED IT WAS USELESS FOR  US  TO SUBMIT COMPLAINTS TO THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU BECAUSE THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU IS SHUTTING DOWN AND WE WERE WASTING OUR TIME.

Mortgage,The Bank of America ave us a schedule of payments and then they changed them by sending monthly notices shown different amounts. Sometimes they were higher and sometimes lower.We always paid the scheduled amount. As a result in some cases we underpaid and some we overpaid The overpaid money went to pay down principle and the underpaid amounts were given a late charge. We paid all these extraneous over charges separately. We want back the amounts paid to principal immediately and while they keep sending us statements I have no proof that they returned the money to me that was used to pay down principal. Because of this I may not have enough money to pay the regular mtg payment Thank You

As of XX/XX/2021, more than 60 days have passed since my application date and they have not issued me a credit decision yet.

I have emailed two of their managers - XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ; they have both been unresponsive to my inquiry and status of my loan. This is a clear RESPA and Equal Credit Opportunity Act violation. 

I am providing you with copies of my initial disclosures to document the application date and provide you with the loan number to reference."
Mortgage,"XXXX 2015 I began a process to get a home equity line of credit from XXXX XXXX Bank in XXXX New York. They found out that Bank of America, who had taken over my loan from now defunct XXXX XXXX XXXX. While BOA did pay the loan off, they never got a lien release, therefore the new bank would not grant a home equity loan. I have worked with numerous people in Bank Of America and after 9 months, they produce an ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE from a representative of the defunct mortgage company. HOWEVER ... THEY DID NOT USE THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE and has been rejected by The XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Bank as it still shows that I have a lien that does not exist! 
It is now almost 14 months to resolve this!! I have tried to contact Bank of America but have not received a return call. 
The missing paragraph in the assignment of mortgage is : "" THIS ASSIGNMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION XXXX OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW BECAUSE IT IS AN ASSIGNMENT WITHING THE SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET '' I am at my wits end to get Bank of America to fulfill their responsibility so I can move forward with my loan application. If this had happened during the sale of my home, it would have caused me to lose the sale for sure! 
It took them 9 months just to get the rep from XXXX XXXX XXXX to sign the incorrectly worded assignment as it is."
Mortgage,"We lost a home in the XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX2018. Our insurance company issued a joint check with a smaller portion due to completely pay off the mortgage holder Bank of America. Since we opened a B of A account, we thought they would deposit the check, subtract their outstanding amount due on the mortgage, and distribute the balance to us expeditiously ( bank agent 's term ). Now we are approaching a month 's time and calling the various bank people at a number of their departments over the country where they claim to have physically sent the check ( Florida from California..? ) and our money has been effectively tied up in their red-tape and dysfunction. We need our money..! While our insurance company worked thru their process efficiently, it's taking Ban of America almost as long to cash a check ( in this day of electronic payment, I'm certain they could confirm and cash that check in minutes ) and distribute our funds as the claims adjusters took to confirm our entire house losses. 

There needs to be a downside to BofA for this kind of malicious money-grubbing larceny from people who simply want to cash a check and deposit their funds ..."
Mortgage,"I started the application for a mortgage with Bank of America since XXXX XXXX of this year. I was promised a closing date of XXXX/XXXX/16. The date got delayed to XXXX then now XXXX. They have tactically requested repeated financial information from me to justify the delay and as of this morning ( 2 days before the third closing date ), they want me to call a third party agency to do a credit supplement check on credit cards that I have already supplied statements and written letters for. If the loan does not come through, I loose my earnest money and other costs associated with buying this house. I have filed several complaints with the bank but was ignored. My loan officer said he is sick and never called back. I can not get anyone to respond. This is just a night mare and no one should have this experience. I have all of the email history to prove their incompetence."
Mortgage,"I was foreclosed on in 2008. I feel as though I was a victim of fraud, discrimination, scam, and robo signing. The lender in question is Courntrywide Home Loans, now known as Bank of America. I begged and pleaded with this lender to work with me instead of working with parties involved whom were intercepting my information. Till this day I have no knowledge of how all of these terrible things have taken place to displace us of our home. End resulting of the bank working with this ring whom end resulted in purchasing my home from the bank for {$500.00}"
Mortgage,"Subject of the complaint : A notice dated XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America was mailed to XXXX XXXX stating that the interest rate of our mortgage loan that they own and service will increase by 0.750 % for 272 months and a final balloon payment of {$250000.00}. We adamantly state again that this mortgage loan modification issued by XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX is fraudulent. The original loan was {$330000.00} and the loan modification exploded it to {$720000.00} which includes a balloon payment of {$210000.00} has a 44 yr. term with escalating interest rates. Additionally, without notifying us, Bank of America extended the loan term to 52 years. We state that the mortgage loan is fraudulent because of documented proof that it was derived from mortgage fraud consisting of unlawful financial policies, manipulated processing times, misrepresentation of information and illegal business practices. 
Purpose of the complaint : We are again appealing to Bank of America on legal, moral, ethical and humane grounds to stop perpetuating this mortgage crime and grave injustice done against the XXXX family. There is urgency to this complaint because Bank of America is about to implement the most formidable and financially damaging period of our mortgage loan. As a hard working family of XXXX descent with roots in XXXX and XXXX we are living in our home for the past 27 years. However we attribute this achievement and our survival from losing our home not only to our persistent tenacity to fight against the injustice done against us but primarily to our faith in the power of Almighty God. 
We are aware that Bank of America has stated exemption from any blame of mortgage fraud related to the mortgage loan that they currently own and service on our home. Their basis for this claim is that it was not them, but XXXX XXXX XXXX that processed the terms and conditions of our loan. But to us their position is analogous to thieves laundering their stolen money in a bank that benefits from the profits and when confronted about the crime they claim innocence or ignorance. Similarly, the case with our home is analogous to a hard working, honest, individual who was criminally and purposefully setup for theft of {$720000.00} and was sentenced to 52 years of punishment for a crime they did not commit. 
Our perspective : We are among the thousands of US citizens, and particularly those of XXXX descent who were victimized by massive mortgage financial crimes committed in XXXX. Our current monthly payments continue to feed the greed of investors with dividends from our fraudulent mortgage loan that was encased in a toxic asset titled XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX. The illegal business strategy all servicers applied to our loan over the 10-yr period was implemented on several levels. First was the abusive and premature action to begin the foreclosure process after only two missed payments and while we were making full monthly payments. Second was the persistent practice of ignoring phone calls and letters about our loan. Third, were the incessant requests by servicers for the exact documents that we had previously submitted. Fourth was the repeated submission of loan modification applications with no approval. Fifth was the practice of changing servicers who regularly demanded starting over the application process. However, the most pervasive strategy was the purposeful and unconscionable manipulation of processing time to extend it so that the excessive charges, missed payments and miscellaneous fees including monthly inspections of the property will accumulate to a financially insurmountable amount. The ultimate goal was for us lose our home. 
Synopsis of the complaint : All information is backed by documentation ) Prior to responding to a solicitation to refinance in XXXX, we had lived in our home for ten ( 10 ) years. The loan was originally made to XXXX XXXX and spouse XXXX XXXX in XXXX each with 50 % ownership certificates to XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX we refinanced for {$330000.00} at 10 % for 30 yrs. with XXXX XXXX XXXX. There were two closings. The loan was finally made to XXXX XXXX and son, XXXX XXXX. Interest rate was to be lowered if we paid the {$2500.00} on time for 6 months and we did. But also six months later the former owners sued the title company XXXX XXXX for issuing a fraudulent title deed with their forged signatures. Refer to court XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We incurred {$25000.00} in legal fees to litigate clearing of the title. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - Countrywide XXXX XXXX. Two periods of unemployment and legal costs caused us to miss two mortgage payments. XXXX XXXX resumed work in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX soon also after. Payments resumed from XXXX. Our request to put the two payments at the end of the loan was repeatedly refused. 
XXXX Countrywide  returned mortgage payments made in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX stating that our home was in foreclosure proceedings. We sent the first letter requesting mortgage forbearance or any other applicable loan modification option. Countrywide  did not respond. 
XXXX we sent six letters to Countrywide  XXXX  XXXX requesting mortgage forbearance or any other applicable loan modification option. No response. 
XXXX The case involving title deed, lasted 3 yrs and was settled with the title cleared and plaintiffs receiving {$25000.00}. We requested an application from Countrywide  for the Home Affordable Mortgage Program offered by the Obama administration for which we more than qualified. Total income was {$82000.00} per yr. No response. We also contacted Senator XXXX for assistance. He responded but was not able to change conditions. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America XXXX Countrywide  XXXX XXXX. The same problem of no response to our request for a HAMP loan modification application continued. Instead, they offered in-house loan modification programs for {$2800.00} to {$4000.00} monthly. We declined offers and continued to request application for HAMP program that was developed for home owners like us. 
XXXX - New servicer- a ) XXXX XXXX XXXX offered HAMP application but maintained the same business policy of repeatedly requesting the same documents with no loan approval. b ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX filed a status report for foreclosure action against us. We responded XXXX XXXX requesting with stated reasons that the court dismiss the plaintiffs action with prejudice. The foreclosure case was placed on hold. 
XXXX a ) On legal advice XXXX XXXX XXXX for bankruptcy to qualify for approval under a loan modification program in Florida. The program required paying XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX {$1400.00} per month through bankruptcy court and attending mediation for XXXX weeks. We complied with both, and paid a total of {$30000.00}. b ) On XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX denied the loan modification application stating insufficient income. This was most offensive because XXXX purposefully disregarded repeated submission of combined income from XXXX resident family members. They chose to isolate XXXX 's income and use for evaluation. Combined income was {$60000.00}. 
XXXX a ) XXXX XXXX XXXX told our attorney to have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bank statements showing that we pay rent to him. We absolutely refused on the legal grounds of falsifying documents and violating the citys residential code about property. b ) XXXX asked the attorney to have XXXX father deposit his social security check into XXXX bank account. We again refused this illegal request, and mutually ended legal services. We filed our XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint against Select Portfolio Servicing for their illegal business practices with purposeful delays in processing approval of our XXXX loan modification application. 
XXXX a ) We received a notice from the court that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXXXXXX had withdrawn the foreclosure action. b ) We filed a second CFPB complaint against XXXX because they continued the same pattern of illegal business practices of purposeful delay tactics to make our indebtedness impossible to regain and retain ownership of our home. c ) XXXX notified us by telephone that they had approved our HAMP loan modification. But no forms were sent for signatures. Our calls about the matter were ignored for weeks. But in late XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX notified us that our loan and processing was transferred to a new servicer. This was vitriolic. 
XXXX New servicer XXXX XXXX  XXXX . a ) On contact with XXXX  about our approved HAMP loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX they told us that we had to start over the application process. b ) We filed a first CFPB complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX. They responded that XXXX  reported our application as incomplete and that the HAMP program ended on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  stated that they can only offer us an in-house loan modification program. Again this was clearly a collaborative reaction. c ) But We completed and returned the application to XXXX. ( d ) On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from XXXX XXXX  XXXX informing us of impending foreclosure proceedings on behalf of their client, XXXX. ( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX we filed a second CFPB complaint against XXXX  and XXXX because it was clear that they were determined to use fraudulent and illegal means to forcefully rob us of our home. ( f ) In late XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called from XXXX XXXX  XXXX about approval of a loan modification with a trial date of XXXX. But he added that we must pay {$10000.00} to begin the trial period. What ensued was a high volume response from me telling him that his company is attempting to extort money illegally from us, and our intent is to file another CFPB complaint. He quickly got off the telephone and returned soon after with perfuse apologies that he was mistakenly looking at another clients file. 
XXXX a ) We accepted the loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX with a written statement that we adamantly deny owing the fraudulent loan balance of {$720000.00}. 27 and we were accepting it under duress. b ) We were convinced that had we rejected it, XXXX would sell our property to a predatory investor for a fraction of what they were demanding from us. During this period It was routine for cars to stop in front of our home and look until we came out our cell phones in hand. We firmly believed then and now that the {$10000.00} demand and enormous loan balance were calculated to force us to reject the loan offer and abandon our home. c ) We contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke XXXX XXXX about our concerns with the loan and followed up with a letter as well as emails to the XXXX Loss Mitigation and Escalation departments. d ) We asked for a 90-day grace period to appeal the XXXX standard loan modification. XXXX XXXX XXXX responded with a letter stating that our loan was owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX and ignored our requests. 
XXXX New servicer Bank of America XXXX This was our second and now current involvement with this bank. ( a ) They charged us {$8500.00} for lender placed hazard insurance on XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted BOA by on-line message to point out the major discrepancy with their price and that of the prior servicer, XXXX XXXX  XXXX  who purchased the LPI for the period XXXX period at {$3700.00}, making Bank of Americas cost over 200 % more. Bank of America stated that it was due to LPI coverage calculated on the loan balance of {$710000.00}. b ) We pointed out that XXXX XXXX  XXXX documented that the LPI was based on the current appraised home value not on the loan balance. We got no response but later noticed a refund of {$8500.00} on the account, and since then the LPI costs are under {$4000.00}. ( b ) In XXXX we filed a CFPB complaint for Bank of America to extend access to a COVID-19 loan deferral program to us. This was done. 
Conclusion : Below are the main damages sustained in our fight for justice and to retain our home. 1 ) Intense emotional and mental stress. Writing tens of letters, and making numerous phone calls with no response, as well as filing complaints are very distressing mentally and emotionally. 2 ) Severe financial damage and losses : - This mainly applies to the fraudulent and illegal 52-year loan balance of {$720000.00}, with yearly increasing interest rates. But it also includes the significant costs of almost {$70000.00} we incurred for the legal and business services we used in our struggle to obtain a loan modification and preserve ownership of our home. 3 ) Currently, there is no path for us to access equity in our home or to sell it for a profit due to the colossal mortgage balance. Therefore at XXXX XXXX XXXX and still in grief for my husband who passed away on XX/XX/XXXX, this situation with our home is ominous, but for Gods presence in my life. This severe injustice put the dream of passing on our home free and clear to our sons at risk, unless circumstances change. 4 ) Devastation of our credit : - Even if I wanted to accept a reverse mortgage on my home, I do not qualify for obvious reasons. Yet we remain confident that we will be vindicated and receive justice, whether it comes from a judge in a court of law or by the power of Almighty God."

Per RESPA as enforced by Regulation X and a group of laws commonly referred to as the California Homeowners Bill of Rights, duel tracking is against the law. Therefore, my home loan account can not be forwarded for foreclosure, or any other separation processes until the modification process in general and the requested HAMP, in specific, has been completed."
Mortgage,Bank of America ignored my request for a modification loan.
Mortgage,"My bank statement for the monthly mortgage payment includes a {$10.00} fee. The fee is described as "" overdue payments, fees, and charges. I called the bank several times to ask why I am being charged that amount every month but they do not give me an explanation and do not delete the fee. My mortgage payment is done via automatic transfers from my bank so the payments are never late. Every time I called for clarification I get transfer from one employee to another but with no result or explanation of what that {$10.00} fee is for. 

I would appreciate any assistance you can provide me on this matter. Thanks"
Mortgage,"I contacted Bank of America to apply for a mortgage pre-approval. I provided all the necessary documents and there was a hard check on my credit score, but even after changing my bank agent one time and contacting the bank multiple times, I never hear a response back. Eventually my mortgage application vanished from my online banking account without me receiving any response. I recently contacted the bank about it and was told that the application was too old and I had to reapply."
Mortgage,"About 1 year ago I when thru a XXXX many things were going bad with my kids XXXX, XXXX all kind of situations took me about 6 months to put myself back up and I try really hard to cut up on many thing that I left behind.

Mortgage,the member file was submitted by XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and the member submitted {$10000.00} to reinstate the loan and then was told it was {$12000.00} dollars and she submitted the money and was told the reinstatement amount was {$15000.00} dollars. She got the funds and submitted the funds and {$2000.00} dollars was kept. the local branch gave her {$13000.00} in plastic bags. She had a police officer help her count the funds and they were short {$2000.00} dollars ... ..
Mortgage,"I am working with Bank of America on a home loan. The closing is scheduled for today ie XXXX XXXX, 2015. But even after repeated requests I was not provided the closing disclosure documents. They just sent it to me and its not what we had discussed initially. They pushed out my closing several times stating they had not received some documents from the closing attorney etc. I dont understand how they can be so lax in their approach. Why cant they track progress and raise a red flag if something is not happening on time..This has caused tremendous discomfort and heartache to my family and me. Pls help.."
Mortgage,"I am currently in the process of purchasing a home and had my credit pulled. It came to my attention that Bank of America posted an erroneous Mortgage Account XXXX with Late Dates : XXXX, XXXX and states consumer disputes - reinvestigation in progress ; foreclosure ; 180 days or more past due. The account shows a zero balance and zero payment due however reflects late payments? This is direct violation of the FCRA ( fair credit reporting act ) and should be removed from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX completely as it is completely false reporting. My Bank of America mortgage was closed in XXXX. I would also like a letter faxed to me at XXXX on Bank of America letterhead stating this was posted to the XXXX bureaus by mistake and this account is not late nor is it even an open account."
Mortgage,"My loan with Bank of America started in XX/XX/XXXX with a balance of {$250000.00}. My loan balance 11 years later is only at {$240000.00}. Where is all of my money going???!! Upon further investigation I tracked back to my loan payments. On XX/XX/XXXX,  BOA increased the principle balance to {$280000.00}!!! I was told by an attorney that they can not increase the principle amount. Where is the money ( approximately {$260000.00} ) that I have been paying to BOA for the past 11 years going???? 

I had written in last year with previous complaints and got nowhere! This is still eating away at my nerves and I can not rest. BOA is stealing and getting away with it. I can not sleep at night because I know they are wrong and I am paying all of this money out to these thieves. They are liars. The letter that they had responded back to me is wrong and I have documentation to prove it. They said my previous loan balance was {$160000.00} for the payoff. That is wrong. I went to the courthouse and my previous loan balance was for {$150000.00} ) and probably less than that because I had been paying on it for several years. I NEVER took out a BOA Equity Maximizer account that was opened apparently in XX/XX/XXXX! Why would I go borrow more money after I just borrowed {$250000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, 6 months prior to that? The {$250000.00} mortgage total was for my previous mortgage payoff of {$150000.00} and a previous loan payoff for of {$50000.00}. We combined the 2 loans {$200000.00}, plus borrowed another {$45000.00} to add to the loan to get {$33000.00} cash out. That "" BOA Equity Maximizer account '' that BOA set up was PUT INTO MY CURRENT LOAN. Now, in XX/XX/XXXX, BOA sends out a letter stating that "" they forgave my loan '' of {$45000.00}. How could they forgive that loan when that amount was added into my current mortgage?????!!!!! So they so called forgave my loan in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Meanwhile, in XX/XX/XXXX I see that BOA is in trouble with the government for fraud! I see where they have to forgive a number of 1st and 2nd mortgages under a settlement agreement. Well while reviewing my records at the courthouse, I see that BOA has a FULL RELEASE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE reported and recorded on XX/XX/XXXX. There is no dollar amount on the paper, just stating that its a full mortgage release. So, to the government, it LOOKS like they paid off my mortgage, but actually it is just that FAKE account that BOA set up ( my home equity maximizer ) that was so called forgiven. If it was the so called home equity account ( never had it ) then why would n't it be recorded at the courthouse in XX/XX/XXXX?!!! Give me a brake!!! They turned that in to the monitor to look like they forgave my loan so they could get credit for it. How can BOA get away with doing this to hard working struggling people? I am so mad and frustrated and they are getting away with it!!! Someone please look into this!!! I guarantee you my house is on the list given to the monitor for the compliance with its consumer relief obligations under the settlement agreement. I would like to see this list of mortgages forgiven and the dollar amounts. 

Also in that letter it says that I signed a loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX changing my repayment period to a 480 month term. Wrong. That was done in XX/XX/XXXX. They never turned that modification in for XX/XX/XXXX because they took my loan to 40 years then and changed the principle to {$280000.00}. They have forged signatures and have my name signed in wrong places. No one can see this modification for a reason. BOA XXXX up and has false documents. Its not recorded anywhere. Not even at the courthouse. I have also included a letter that they send to me, XXXX XXXX, but addressed to XXXX XXXX XXXX!!! They have XXXX around with so many accounts, they do n't know whose account they are dealing with. Wrong account numbers, wrong names, wrong dollar amounts!!!! Anytime I would call about my account, they would be puzzled ... ... '' well, why is you account balance higher than your principle? '' "" This ca n't be right. '' "" Is this a mistake? '' They all could see that I was getting XXXX over, but nobody could fix it. 

I am not resting at night because BOA is getting away with doing this to me and my family. I have enough problems. I am guardian for my husband who is XXXX XXXX and thats how all of this started. I was desperate and they saw that, and they took full advantage over me. I pray to XXXX that someone catches this mistake and corrects it."
Mortgage,I paid off my home loan with Bank Of America and they did n't pay me all my interest back.
Mortgage,"On Friday, XX/XX/2018 I was contacted by an individual claiming to be from Bank of America. She said here name was XXXX and the number she called from is XXXX. She said she was calling in regards to my home equity line of credit. I do not have any accounts with Bank of America nor have I applied for a home equity line of credit from Bank of America. She asked for personal information to confirm my identity. I did not give her any and hung up. I contacted Bank of America to inquire about any activity under my name and they said they did not have any."
Mortgage,"I am trying to remove my name from a home loan used by my ex wife for her business. I did not sign for this loan and have asked Bank of America to send me any document with my signature on the application process. I received XXXX documents from the bank ( 1 ) a power of attorney with my signature surrendering my interests to the house used for business as agreed upon in the divorce settlement. And ( 2 ) a loan document dated 5 days after my final divorce decree with my ex wife signing my name in reference to the aforementioned power of attorney. This power of attorney that I signed as agreed upon in the divorce stipulation simply surrenders all my claim to the property and has no stipulation for any past or future responsibility for the property. 
It is my understanding that any contract which does not have my signature is null and void and can not be enforced. This is not what I am asking the bank to do. The loan is not in default and is current in the payment schedule because this is used for business by my ex wife. I am merely asking the bank to remove my name from the loan and credit report. 
So far all I have received is requests for more time to do their investigation and I have been patiently waiting for a favorable resolution. But now they have shifted tactics and is making this an identity theft issue and requesting me for notarized statements and police reports. I submit that it is their lax loan approval process that lead to a loan being approved without proper signatures more than anything else."
Mortgage,"Bank of America sold my account in XXXX 2016. It was never delinquent, but Bank of America reported it delinquent in XXXX 2016."
Mortgage,"In the process of a home sale - the buyer 's title search discovered separate entries for the original mortgage with Bank of America as well as a 2nd mortgage ( home equity ). All communication with Bank of America throughout the life of the mortgages ( they were bought from Countrywide ) were in reference to a single account owed which  included the original mortgage ( XXXX ) and the home equity ( XXXX ) consolidated into one.

Once discovered the multiple mortgages filed with the country we have tried to get this resolved with Bank of America who have expressed multiple times that there is a singular account to be owed and that there must have been a clerical error in which the consolidation wasn't provided to county and that XXXX  is owed on that 2nd mortgage. We ge
t a claim number and the case keeps getting closed with new payoff letters that just address the singular account.

The math is simple to prove that the account is the combination of both the original and the home equity. 

XXXX original mortgage XXXX 3 years of payments of approx XXXX/month XXXX - home equity XXXX ( XXXX to homeowner plus closing fees ) - new mortgage filed XXXX Clearly the amount owed prior to the home equity was approx XXXX and the new amount brought the mortgage owed to XXXX. 

The inaction of Bank of America to rectify this bookkeeping error has held up a home sale that is needed in these tough economic times. 

We have agreed to close on the mortgage that Bank of America acknowledges and hold the XXXX in escrow to protect the buyer while we settle this but that isXXXX profit that is needed and owed. 

We need help getting Bank of America to issue the proper XXXX balance on that 2nd mortgage and acknowledge the obvious that it was consolidated."
Mortgage,I had my loan with country wide bank of America took it over everything was fine until I feel on some hard times last year. There collections department called and I was able to set up a repayment plan to get caught up but then even while I was making all my payments on the time table they set up for me every few days they would call me and tell me my home was going into foreclosure and I side I 'm making all my payments on time that they had set up. They then told me that until I made the last payment they had the right to call me any time they wanted. I got everything caught up last month I made my payment early this month I am a little tight but will have it payed before any late fees go on it which is how I paid it for years and they never called or complained about it now they have there collections department calling me way before the grace period is up I still have 11 days in the grace period. I filed a complaint at the bank when the issue with the harassment during the repayment and got no results. I have always paid extra on my loan and did even on the repayment plan and every month since I do not think I need to be harassed before I am out side the grace period.
Mortgage,"I applied for, Again for a Pre-approval on a Property in order to be able to view, several properties, in order to be able to use an make a Consumer Credit Transaction, to purchase myself a home. After Filing a report with this agency back in, I think it was XX/XX/XXXX, Pertaining to this same agency. Bank of America, I recieved a respone letter and Call, some time after this, saying that, 'Bank of America , had, 'Pre-approved me for a Mortgage, and that I never responded. The Asociate ask me to come back in to a BOFA and reapply. I went to, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Pa XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to an Asociate, by the name of, XXXX XXXX show him the response letter, showing that I I was, previously Pre-Approved, He said, that the letter doesn't mean a thing, and that bank, often send out letters like this to their customers. XXXX XXXX said he Could Not assist me, so he put me in touch with, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, in the mortgage department. XXXX XXXX said, he Could Not assist me, said my, 'credit score, is to low for the bank to assist me in getting a Pre-approval, I told him, that it is against, Federal Law to deny me an, 'Extension of Credit ' he told me, I am Not denying you, I am simply stating BOFA, Policy, because of this, he refuse give an Pre-approval. I completed the mortgage application, anyway, spoke with, XXXX XXXX on the phone, XX/XX/XXXX she told me my credit score is to low, for BOFA policy, and that she was Unable to assist me, with an Extension of my Consumer Credit."
Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I initiated modification proceedings in good faith with BOA. At this time I was receiving at least one call per day, including Saturdays. I also was told in the paperwork and in phone conversations that I would have a single point of contact which turned out to be several individuals who would continue to harass me XXXX to 4 time a week. Having completed and submitted paperwork which included a 3rd party questionnaire where I, being new to this, stated that I have had contact with a third party counselor and could seek their help if it would be beneficial to my cause. On or about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received the street comp valuation of my property. I soon found out that a trial offer had been submitted and when contacted by BOA was assured that I did not have to make payments til XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Being right before XXXX and having been reminded every single time I was contacted that there was a notice to accelerate foreclosure that expired on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and that they did not need to give me any further notice to foreclose on my property. Being under this duress and the financial strain from a loss of income from our small business and my wife needing XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which delayed her taking a job til XXXX I indicated I could accept their offer which apparently came through the Streamlined FHA Mod Program. My complaint is thus, I was not informed of the particulars of the modification except for the details of XXXX trial payments of {$630.00} then 6.75 % ( the rate on the current 30 year mortgage ) and for a term of 40 years. I still do not at this point know exactly what they will be financing, what fees they will expect me to pay and how charging me an extra {$40000.00} in interest makes this affordable. I was told that being that we were in financial distress and qualified for the modification my credit score would not be used to determine any of the parameters of the modification."
Mortgage,"My parents had their mortgage with Bank of America. Last year my mother,  XXXX   XXXX  and my father,  XXXX   XXXX , both passed away. I,  XXXX   XXXX , have been dealing with Bank of America as the executrix for the estate since that occurred. I received, a t one poi nt daily, calls from Bank of America asking about the intention with the property. Despite my telling them on numerous occasions that we listed it for sale in   XX/XX/XXXX  ( t he month after my father passe d ) they w ould act as if they never had any knowledge of what was going on with the property each time they called. Then, I received a letter from an attorneys office on the bank 's behalf. I sent letters to them also advising them of my involvement and the fact of the sale. I then advised them that we had a contract for sale which was supposed to occur by the end of  XXXX . I sent them a contract extension date for   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     and despite receiving that, the attorneys office started foreclosure proceedings once they learned of the pending sale. The day that I learned the closing would in fact be Monday   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    , I called the attorneys office every hour the try to obtain a payoff figure. They called me back the next day but I learned that they day before, they returned the foreclosure complaint to court, thus incurring additional fees and costs despite the fact that they did not have to return the complaint to court until 6 days before the return date of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    . This was yet another way to incur unnecessary attorneys fees and costs on this file. The first payoff figure I received from the bank was good through   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     and had  XXXX  attorneys fees and court costs. The second payoff figure I received which was good for the   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     closing, a mere 10 days later, suddenly included {$3500.00} in attorneys fees and costs. We took the first offer we got on the house to get it sold, so the estate was not netting much money anyway and now, that money is being paid to an attorneys office for work that was unnecessary and seemingly unethical. Pursuing the foreclosure action at this late stage was actually harming their client 's interest because a sale date was already in the works. This was not a situation where I simply defaulted on my mortgage. My parents passed away and I did the best I could to get the house sold as soon as possible and to keep the bank apprised of that along way. They extended no courtesy at all during this entire process and have now taken what little money the estate was going to get from this sale to pay an attorneys office to do a job they did not need to do at this late stage."
Mortgage,"We have been requesting a modification since XXXX. We have been jerked around over and over. We have even called the corporate Headquarter to no avail.

We have contacted many difference agencies and have been approved under the, ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ect, which Bank of America has denied all of these programs approvals for us.. We have worked with XXXX for years and every time we got close to being modified, BOA told us we had to drop XXXX in orderr for the to help us and as always we end up in FORECLOSE again, again, again, .They promised if we could not get APPROVED we could use the XXXX program or short sale route to liquidate the property. But as always. Forecloser notices ARRIVED AT OUR DOOR OVER AND OVER AND OVER.We deserve a second chance like everyone else.Why have n't we received ours?"
Mortgage,"We agreed to purchase a bank owned property for full asking price in XXXX XXXX and the offer was accepted. We placed 10 % of the money into escrow. The bank delayed closing then until XXXX XXXX because of a right of redemption that was placed on the property. Then the ROR was waived and we signed closing documents on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and wired the rest of the money out of our account. Now, a week later, the bank has the entire purchase price but has failed to release the property to us and we are told that this will take more time because they require another appraisal."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2020 I paid off the 2nd mortgage on my home. Bank of America received the funds on XX/XX/2020. I have applied and been approved for a HELOC with another financial institution to consolidate debt. I am unable to complete this transaction due to Bank of America not yet sending the Lien release paperwork to my county. I have called the Lien release customer service 43 times, to no avail. All I am asking is for them the send the lien release to my county clerks office. This document was generated on XX/XX/2020 and was allegedly sent to my county on XX/XX/2020. My county has NEVER received it. I have requested to have this sent to my county office on four occasions. I have requested to speak to a manager or a supervisor on five occasions and they schedule a time to call me back with a 2 hour window and I have NEVER heard back from a single one. ALL I want is for them to do what they are supposed to do nd send the lien release to my county. Thank you in advance for your time."
Mortgage,"Bank of America Mortgage Account XXXX was incurred as part of a normal 80/20 mortgage and used for the purchase price ( "" purchase money '' ) of the borrower 's primary residence in XX/XX/XXXX, which was located at XXXX XXXX Ct XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. The property was foreclosed upon in XX/XX/XXXX. This was not an equity line of credit and it was not a refinance and, being "" purchase money '', this debt is protected from collection pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, section 580b. However, Bank off America pursued this debt through the use of XXXX collection agencies ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX ) - see attached letters. When we responded to these claims and requested proof of the debt owed to be provided within 10 days ( see attached letter to BofA ) we were not contacted by BofA or its representatives further. Proof of any debt to BofA was never provided. Since that time, BofA has posted a charge-off amount of {$4700.00} related to this account ( # XXXX ) on our credit file. I have contacted BofA numerous times to find out what this charged-off amount is, proof of it being owed, and, if proven to be owed, a mechanism for settling the debt should be provided. Bank of America has been unwilling to provide proof of this debt or any mechanism to settle it. The statute of limitations in California ( 4 years ) has expired on this charged-off balance and Bank of America has no recourse to the debt they claim I owe. No proof of this debt has been provided which is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I believe that Bank of America has fraudulently placed this charge-off in my credit file for the sole purpose of damaging my good credit."
Mortgage,"My job closed for a week, which caused a significant loss in wages. I applied for a loan modification XXXX/JXX/XX/2019 with Bank of America. I submitted all documents that was written on the modification application. I was quickly denied due to not able to verify my assets or source of funds, but I qualified for a short sale. I did not understand why I was denied and I desperately want to keep my home, so I called my representative. I've been assigned several representatives in which no one has been able to consistently answer or explain my denial. The first application and denial, I requested a re-eval with an explanation of not being able to verify my assets or funds. After this request, I was not able to reach my representative anymore and was tossed around by any representative who answered the phone. I had to explain my situation over and over again, which became frustrating. I was getting further behind in my mortgage with no help. I was still sending in some money. I soon re-applied. Shortly after re-applying, I was denied for the same reason, not able to verify my assets or source of income. My assigned representative was now XXXX XXXX. I tried to explain to her my unexplained issues from the first representative, but she didn't seem concerned as well. I even spoke to someone on the underwriter team. Eventually, I kept searching for help because I am a first time homeowner and single parent and desperately trying to keep my home with outstanding arrears. I found XXXX and received help from them. I had to re-apply. After reapplying, and going through XXXX, I was denied once again for the same reason, unable to verify my assets or source of income.

Mortgage,"I received a home loan modification and made my payments on time. My modification was officially approved and I just received a phone call from Bank of America yesterday letting me know that my modification was approved. The late payments are erroneous. This is also an FHA loan.

Mortgage,"In the process of refinancing my secondary mortgage, I needed to close out a Bank of America ( BofA ) Home Equity Loan of Credit ( HELOC ). On XX/XX/2020, I called BofAs HELOC department to discuss the charges associated with this step. The agent on the line, who presented himself as XXXX, said the closing cost of {$940.00} ( {$960.00} total fee less {$18.00} in county fees ) would be waived. He referenced my preferred customer status and good standing with BofA for many years as the reason behind the refund. He noted that after escrow closes, a refund will be sent my way. He also gave me confirmation numbers for the call ( XXXX ) and the refund ( XXXX ). 
On XX/XX/2020 the refinancing closed. On XX/XX/2020, I went to my local BofA branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ) to check on the refund status. I spoke with Assistant Manager XXXX XXXX who told me he did not see anything in BofAs system regarding a refund. He proceeded on opening a claim ( ID XXXX ) in regard to this matter with BofAs mortgage department. I followed up with him several times and did not hear a response. When I caught him on the phone last week, he informed me that he is taking a leave of absence and I should take my matter up with the BofA district manager. 
BofA is not honoring their verbal commitment in this matter to refund the HELOC net closing cost of {$940.00}. I have included the reference numbers for the original conversation, refund claim and follow up claim. BofA representatives portrayed one policy and are not abiding this policy. BofA is also claiming no record of the initial conversation I had with them.

I am writing this letter to you to inform you of these misleading policies as I am likely only one of many who has been guided toward a refund in order to pay a closing charge. 
I thank you for your consideration of this matter. I appreciate any assistance you may offer me in achieving my original refund claim. Thank you."
Mortgage,"I am a retired XXXX senior citizen and resident of XXXX XXXX, California. 

I refinanced my house with Bank of America ( BofA ) in XXXX and closed the new loan on XX/XX/XXXX. At the initial purchase of the house in XXXX, I qualified for the Mortgage Credit Certificate from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 

I have qualified for reissuing of the Certificate upon refinancing because the application and fee payment have been submitted within 365 days of closing of the loan for past refinances. However, after the last refinancing, the BofA Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX, never submitted the application despite the guideline specifying to do so within one year of closing and several requests. 

XXXX advised me to send the fee of {$800.00} directly to the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, and I complied. However, its her responsibility to submit the application and as of today she isnt explaining why she didnt do it within the timeframe. Her later responses are vague and only explaining whats the purpose of the certificate. Explanations that I dont need after 11 years of claiming the credit on my returns. Losing the benefits of the certificate and the {$800.00} fee payment would be devastating to my mental health and current financial situation. 

I feel this is negligence and racism for being XXXX and a senior citizen. 

Please assist me with obtaining my potentially lost Reissued Mortgage Credit Certificate ( RMCC ).

Thank you."
Mortgage,"I have a home equity line of credit from  Bank of America. It was a ten year pla n and then you had to pay it off. When it matured in  XXXX  of   XXXX   I was in the process of getting a new line of credit and they charg ed me 5 percent l ate fee on the balloon balance. This charge was about {$7400.00}. I told them I was in the process of getting a new line and they said they would remove the fee when the account was paid in full. I said I needed to have it removed so I could determine the correct pay off amount. They would n't budge, I did n't trust the company to remove it at loan closing time. The contract says nothing about charging a late fee for the balloon balance. It says a late fee will be charged for any monthly payment received late, but nothing for the balloon balance. 27 months went by and I faithfully sent my payment of the interest charge and some of the principal. In 13 years I had never missed a payment or had a payment received  late. My credit score  was excellent. Even though I paid the interest each month from the monthly statements I received from BOA, they still reported my account as delinquent because the line of credit had matured. I had written several letters asking for the amounts to be removed and got no response. The first week in  XXXX  of this year a Foreclosure Notice was duct taped to my front door. I was shocked, disgusted, and embarrassed. I have always paid my bills or gone without and now my house was going to be sold at auction on  XXXX   XXXX . I now have a weakened credit record and I am trying to get a new line and I am still unable to get BOA to remove the charges."
Mortgage,"Bank of America failed to disclose proper documents as to the proper owner of my home. Bank of America also did not allow another modification due to a previous modification within 24 months. I was told I could not appeal and had to start the RMA process all over again and the only option was to short sell. Bank of America had incorrect information from the creditors and the amount for my mortgage was calculated higher, leaving me with a denied application. I have also submitted at summary judgement against Bank of America. My home was sent to foreclosure in the courts by the attorneys of Bank of America.

BOA admitted verbally that they were in error with the filing of the mortgage documents, with the title company, and with their internal accounting system. I have never received documentation concerning these transactions as promised. As of today, I am being denied credit for inaccurate information reporting by BOA to all XXXX credit rating agencies."
Mortgage,"I'm writing to request assistance to address what we believe is a failure by Bank of America ( BoA ) to provide mortgage relief to homeowners such as ourselves as required by its settlement with the Department of Justice after the bank 's acquisition of XXXX XXXX  We obtained a mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  operated by XXXX, to purchase a house in XXXX Texas in XXXX. As part of BoA 's settlement, it was supposed to forgive or reduce the amount owed on first and second mortgages it held and obtained as part of its acquisition of XXXX In our case, we had just exited bankruptcy in XXXX and didn't think we would have the credit history that would allow us to get a loan Ito buy a home. But when we were looking for a home, an independent broker approached us and explained how. he could help us obtain a loan despite our credit history. Ultimately, he was able to help us obtain a {$320000.00} first mortgage and an {$85000.00} second mortgage to purchase a house with no money down. But the first mortgage was a 1-year adjustable mortgage with a 9.78 % rate and a balloon payment after three years. The payments were high and after the first year the payments escalated when the rate went un Like many pennle, the financial crisis made it very difficult for us to make over {$5000.00} in monthly payments for both mortgages, even with my husband working two jobs ( I was XXXX ). 
In XXXX  BoA sent us a home equity forgiveness letter that was supposed to expunge our second mortgage and they modified our first mortgage by changing it from a 1-year variable rate martgage to a 30-year fixed martgage that reduced the payments to {$2900.00} per month. But my husband lost his job, which made making even that payment difficult and we filed for bankruptcy again in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). We were able to get our first mortgage payment reduced to about {$2000.00} through the court! and continued to make those payments until my husband had XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. We sought bankruptcy protection again ( XXXX XXXX ), but our request for further modification was denied. It was around XXXX that we became aware that BoA had not discharged the second mortgage but instead combined it with the first, despite our having received a release of lien on the second mortgage ( that we had misplaced until we found it again when we tried to sell our house in XXXX At that time BoA claimed that our total unpaid balance was {$430000.00}. 
When BoA refused to acknowledge the discharge of our second mortgage and modify our first by reducing the principal balance further, we attempted to get assistance through HUD 's Home Affordable Refinance Program ( HARP ) based on my bushand 's health conditing, hut nnthing same nf that. We stopped making mortgage payments while in bankruptcy but paid our homeowners association and insurance payments directly rather than through an escrow account. We made the court-ordered monthly payment of {$1500.00} on our non- mortgage debts from XXXX, but as we were seeking to exit bankruptcy BoA once again came in to claim that they were still owed unpaid accrued principal and interest on what was still a first and secand martgugte, but byr thar they tatalad {$74.00} XXXX. We filed for XXXX XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX to address this debt specifically, but at some point BoA sold our loan ( s ) to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
We attempted to resolve this mortgage debt once and for all, first with a short sale and deed in lieu of foreclosure in XXXX and then a straight out sale as the housing market had improved in XXXX and XXXX. But by then, and although we held the deed, the combination of mistakes by BoA ( forgiveness of the second mortgage, etc. ) coupled with our multiple bankruptcies made it difficult to establish clear title to the property and who had a properly recorded lien against it. As a result, two attempts to sell our property in XXXX  were scuttled over incomplete and inaccurate information on the closing documents and disclosures and disagreements over who had a lien and whether we were entitled to any excess proceeds ( after debt extinguishment and exiting XXXX XXXX bankruptcy ). It was then that we found out that BoA had lender-placed insurance on our home, because they didn't know that we had been paying for a policy outside of any escrow, and at closing they wanted to recoup the premiums they paid but that were not necessary. We also found out during these closings that a broker fraudulently obtained a loan modification in XXXX XXXX  that we did not authorize using loan documents with our forged signatures. 
For all of the reasons noted above, we do not beliewe that BoA ( now XXXX XXXX ) is owed what they claim they are owed, but because of the problems they helped to create we are unable to sell our house. We ask for whatever assistance you can provide, including referring this matter to those other federal agencies that might have jurisdiction over mortgage and banking matters. Thank you."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX a home equity conversion mortgage payment plan was drawn up and signed with Bank of America. FHA case # XXXX Loan servicing number : XXXX Name of borrowers : XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Property : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX The payment plan is as follows : monthly payments of {$1000.00} for 13 years expiring XX/XX/XXXX. 
{$29000.00} was set aside in a line of credit Over the years, this reverse mortgage was sold to XXXX XXXX company and XXXXXXXX XXXX. Recently, it came to our attention that the LOC seemed to be decreasing. Several phone calls were made to the XXXX to clarify the amount of money available. Each time we spoke to a representative we received misleading and conflicting information. Therefore, a complaint was filed with NYS Dept. of Financial Services on XXXX XXXX, XXXX Case # XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) recommended we file a complaint. According to XXXX, there was an error in calculating enough funds to make 13 years worth of monthly payments at origination. They accuse Bank of America of this error. Therefore, XXXX has been drawing funds from the LOC to make the monthly payments without our knowledge. We feel we have been misled and misinformed by XXXX. We depended on the LOC to live after we receive our last monthly payment."
Mortgage,"Subject : Bank Of America ( BOA ), I was forced into a Deed In Lieu and Loss of VA eligibility when other options were available. Reference Loan # XXXX I am a 21 year ( XXXX ) Military veteran. I am currently employed as a XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 
On or around the later part of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from the Department Of Justice informing me that I was among a settlement class of more than 200,000 XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX Borrowers who qualified for Loans and were charged higher fees or placed into Subprime Loans ( see attached article ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was found liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Country-wide  unit. 
Around this same time ( not knowing very much about the DOJ action or what impacts it had on my mortgage situation ) I made every effort to seek relief and assistance from Bank of America in order to retain my home, to include considering a short sale ; however, due to the housing market at the time this approach was also unsuccessful. I worked feverishly to put myself in the best possible situation to reestablish my finances in the hopes that if I had to lose my house the cost would be minimal and the adverse effects less severe. I consulted my assigned Bank of America representatives in the later part of XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that the Deed in Lieu process would be a less harmful option. At no time was I informed regarding a pending principal forgiveness offer. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter forwarded to my current residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Ala. XXXX from Bank of America. The letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX ( See attachment ) It was sent to my previous address at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ala XXXX. The Bank of America letter is a principal forgiveness offer resulting in part from the DOJ  settlement. This offer would have reduced my principal from {$400000.00} with a monthly payment of {$2400.00} to a new principal of {$240000.00} with a monthly payment of {$1400.00}. This would have been just the remedy I needed to retain my home and continue to re-establish financial stability ; however I was not afforded the opportunity to accept it. 

Note : This principal reduction offer is dated XX/XX/XXXX. The same date that the Deed in Lieu action became final. ( See attachment ) At no time prior to leaving my home was I informed by BOA of any special relief that was available for mortgage holders that were affected by the pending legal judgment that would aid me in retaining ownership of the property. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received restitution associated with the judgement from the DOJ in the amount of {$2200.00}. As a consequence of BOA not informing me in a timely manner that this modification option was available to me, I lost my home and entire VA home loan eligibility benefit. 
The attached loan offer document shows that the current loan had a monthly payment of {$2400.00} with a Balance of {$400000.00} the modification offer, if I had received it in a timely manner would have reduce the monthly payment to a manageable {$1400.00} per month and reduced the overall balance on the property to {$240000.00}. I would still be in possession of my home and my well-earned VA benefit. 

Consequently, the VA payout to BOA for the higher guarantee amount of {$410.00} instead of {$240000.00} voided any remaining VA benefit that I could use to purchase a new home. Bottom line, my financial situation is greatly improved ; however, due to me losing my VA eligibility I must now wait a total of 3 to 7 years to qualify for a FHA or Conventional home loan."
Mortgage,"Bank of America Mortgage uses illegal mortgage lending practices, disregards regulatory requirements, and violates signed mortgage lending documents, in my opinion. In XXXX, 2021, a refinancing application was submitted. Based on a credit score over 800, loan to value ratio of 50 % and debt to income ratio under 30 %, Bank of America Mortgage provided a rate lock agreement and mortgage approval. All required supporting documentation was submitted, and accepted, well in advance of deadlines. All appraisal and other fees were paid and the application was forwarded to underwriting. There has been no communication from Bank of America Mortgage since that time. Despite repeated telephone, e-mail, and written requests, Bank of America refused to provide status of the loan or any other information. Complaints # XXXX and XXXX were submitted through CFPB. Bank of America Mortgage evidently responded to CFPB but not me. After 5 months there has been absolutely no communication from Bank of America Mortgage. It seems obvious to me that Bank of America is refusing to put anything in writing because of illegal actions on their part."
Mortgage,"RECONTRUST committed and act of fraud and deception against me AND cfpb when the Company responded on XX/XX/XXXX. RECONTRUST falsely responded to the CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECION BUREAU ( cfpb ) that it HAD SENT its response "" directly '' to the consumer ( me ) "" privately '' following my complaint ( XXXX ) which I had submitted to the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX. 
However 59 days later I have received nothing from RECONTRUST in answer to my complaint. RECONTRUST failed to respond and provided a false response to the cfpb. 
RECONTRUST had a "" duty to respond '' and provided false information that it had already performed said duty. RECONTRUST provided false information in its response to the cfpb as a dilatory tactic to avoid accountability for its part in CHARGING UNLAWFUL and EXCESSIVE FEES in violation of MONTANA state law and also to date, failing to provide a settlement statement and failing to provide a comprehensive line by line itemization and breakdown of the charges as I had requested in writing previously. 
Under Montanas Small Tract Financing Act, the legal fees that may be passed  on the borrower are subject to a statutory formula. 

Reasonable trustees ' fees and attorneys ' fees to be charged to the grantor in the event of foreclosure by advertisement and sale shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 5 % of the amount due on the obligation, both principal and interest, at the time of the trustee 's sale. If prior to the trustee 's sale the obligation and the trust indenture shall be reinstated in accordance with provisions of XXXX, the reasonable trustees ' fees and attorneys ' fees to be charged to the grantor shall not exceed the lesser of {$1000.00} or 1 % of the amount due on the obligation, both principal and interest, at the time of default. In no event shall trustees ' fees and attorneys ' fees be charged to a grantor on account of any services rendered prior to the commencement of foreclosure. 
RECONTRUST charged me 'in excess ' of 13 months in interest charges and in excess of 23 months principal charges for just 8 ( eight ) months of arrears and in ADDITION they charged {$3000.00} in 'administrative fees ' {$2000.00} more than allowed by Montanas Small Tract Financing Act. The months of arrears according to their documents ( which contain "" yet unresolved servicing errors '' beginning with my very first payment on my mortgage ) were listed ( incorrectly ) from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX for which reinstatement documents were returned to RECONTRUST on or about XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was charged {$14000.00} in interest. ( Interest was approx {$1000.00} per month ) which is in excess of 13 months of interest. I was ALSO CHARGED {$6100.00} in principal ( principal was approx. {$260.00} per month ) which is in excess of 23 MONTHS. From this they placed {$3100.00} into escrow for Hazard Insurance and County Tax. This left {$3000.00} which is 11 ( eleven ) months of principal. To they there was an ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRAIVE FEE of {$3000.00} for which only {$1000.00} is allowed by Montana Law. 
RECONTRUST illegally charged me {$7300.00} on which they have also collected interest for in excess of 9 years for an additional sum of approximately {$1700.00} in interest accrued on unlawful charges. 
RECONTRUST owes me at minimum {$9100.00} in unlawfully charged sums. 

ReconTrust ( currently Headquartered in XXXX XXXX, CA, ReconTrust is a member of the Bank of America family of companies. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California ) On or before XX/XX/XXXX, RECONTRUST "" falsely '' made a statement to the cfpb, and the cfpb recording the following in summary regarding RECONTRUST 's response : "" The company sent its response directly to the consumer because it could not confirm who submitted this complaint. '' However MY NAME IS ON THE MORTGAGE and DEED and I am still residing in the same property on that mortgage which was purchased XX/XX/XXXX, for which RECONTRUST charged UNLAWFUL fees as noted herein above in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Only upon a judge 's finding in recent court case ( XX/XX/XXXX )  did I go back to review the transactional history to also discover the unlawful fees hidden in the transactional history when the judge quoted the applicable state law. 
This is likely why RECONTRUST gave the above response rather than answering my former complaint ; XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX. Not only was the RECONTRUST response a dilatory tactic to avoid accountability it was also meant to avoid having CFPB find cause to fine them for damages. 

RECONTRUST is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank Of America companies."
Mortgage,"In XXXX I started the loan modification process. After submitting all the documents we started the process, soon after all the problems surfaced which dragged the process to XXXX XXXX many times I explained the situation to Bank of America either I received no response or a lie that my loan modification was in the process and would be approved once I resubmit needed documentation, Even the { XXXX } manager lied by saying that she is going to be working with me to complete the MODIFICATION not to worry. I was told countless lies. 

Most of my documents were either lost or not processed correctly. Those that were processed had all the wrong income figures. They literally made mistake in their calculations and did not want to accept responsibility. Even when I found knowledgeable individuals to explain their mathematical errors, their response was, "" This is what it is, '' and that they were not going to correct them. They dragged the modification process while adding on late fees etc. In another department BOA has started the foreclosure process being that the loan is in default. According to { HAMP } guidelines ... .I qualify for the program"
Mortgage,"Bank of America Home Loans Division in XXXX XXXX, Texas along with their underwriting department in XXXX Texas, declined my mortgage loan application, one day prior to a scheduled closing for our new home at XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX. I have significant evidence that the denial, which the bank claimed was due to not meeting the required Debt-to-Income ratio, was based on false grounds due to a gross error made by BOA 's lead underwriter in interpreting my 2016 year-to-date self-employment/company Profit and Loss statement. The application review also contained numerous other unwarranted delays as well as sloppy clerical practices and bank errors and omissions that were unprofessionally handled. Ultimately, the rejection of the loan application may have potentially may have violated the bank 's own lending policies and I am seeking Federal assistance to look into this matter in detail. I am also seeking a financial settlement for economic damages related to having to renegotiate a new loan application which delayed my move in date for four weeks."
Mortgage,I originally purchased a home with a mortgage from Countrywide which was then purchased by Bank of America. A little while after the purchase my wife lost her job and I tried to be proactive and work with the lender. I was told they would n't negotiate with us until we were pass due and to stop making payments. Then I called them after I was XXXX days past due and they told me not to send any payments unless it was in full and they would send me a packet. I completed multiple packets with them to restructure the loan and was told they lost the information or never received it. We got so far behind we attempted a short sale. We had a reasonable offer on the table and the lender refused it. XX/XX/XXXX we had a court hearing where I told their attorney and the judge we just wanted out of the home so we could start over. I was told the foreclosure sale would happen XX/XX/XXXX. We moved out of the house in preparation for that but the foreclosure never happened and over XXXX years later they still have n't done anything.
Mortgage,"This is my fourth complaint against  Bank of America. The other 3 are,  in order of creation,  XXXX ,  XXXX , and  XXXX . Regarding the third complaint  (   XXXX   ), a BofA represent ative contacted me on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   to review the fact that not once but TWICE I was disregarded as a candidate for refinance, once last year and once early this year, with no advice for alternative programs, which do in fact exist. However, she decided she would not address this latest debauchery of apparent discrimination but would attempt to gloss over it by stating  ( 1 ) BofA ha s no record of my having filled out an application for refinance during or after this call, and thereby yet again attempted to pass responsibility for this failure back to me by alluding to the possibility that I never put forth the attempt and therefore I was never rejected . and ( 2 ) atte mpted to send me via phone over to their department/s that would in fact assist m e ( finally ). I told   her that the original issue and attempt to refinance were now, and at least for the time being, moot. I want the disregard and discrimination I experienced TWICE, once last year and once this year, fully addressed. For this is in fact now the overriding issue. I also told her I  told two other BofA employees, one of whom was also an RA representati ve,  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , that I experienced this disregard, and disrespect TWICE. Both men knew of this but they decided it was unimportant. But it most certainly is important. I asked the woman if she had listened to the recording of my second attempt to refinance from this year. She stated she had n't. I then asked her why I would have bothered to fill out an application for refinance ( as she alluded I certainly must have if I inquired about it ... RIGHT??!! ) when I was told unequivocally on the phone, last year and this year, that I am ineligible? This she could not answer. I am stating herein that that second attempt occurred on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   at  XXXX  PM. I actually scheduled the appointment through  BankofAmerica online appointment calendar. I had a representative call me to confirm it. I have record via email of that appointment and I have record of the call to me from the BoFA loan officer  in my  XXXX  account. The call DID occur ... I was rejected after  3 minutes! I  want that call researched, investigated and analyzed before going any further. I refuse to take responsibility for this! I did n't apply because I was told I am ineligible!! TWICE!!"
Mortgage,I have always paid on time on my mortgage but it shows as 60 days late payments which is not true.
Mortgage,"I am filing a complaint against Bank of America Home Loans XXXX XXXX dba XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX for deceptive and unfair banking practices in the mortgage and credit risk department. They are intentionally using an appraisal report where the appraiser has committed the following 2019 USPAP Violations : Standard Rule 1-1 ( a  ) ( b ) ( c ). A substantial amount of errors where noted that significant affect the opinions and credibility of the appraisal report. The sales value was based on inaccurate information regarding the condition of the property and the appraisal report contained multiple errors that significantly impact the credibility. 

This complaint will reveal how the lender intentionally used insufficient information to support the credit decision and has failed to monitor the performance of the appraiser who performed the evaluation. The lender failed to properly dismiss the appraisal even after knowledge of violation of appraisal regulations that demonstrates the appraiser performed the evaluation in a reckless and negligent matter. 

An appraisal was conducted on XX/XX/2019 and the report was provided to me on XX/XX/XXXX. An official appraisal dispute notice, XXXX XXXX Selling Guide, property condition disclosure, purchase agreement, accepted seller repairs, inspection report, subject property XXXX listings, pre and post renovation photos of the property, comparable sales proximity information, 2 proposed comparable properties and the county Landroll detail were submitted with my dispute. The lender claimed that another appraisal would be completed, however on XX/XX/2019, it was communicated to me that the appraisal reconsideration was completed and there was no change in value. The appraisal report contained the following errors and inconsistencies. 

1. Subject : The appraiser indicated that the property was owner occupied which is inconsistent with the Property Condition Disclosure and inspection conducted on XX/XX/2019. Occupancy Status of Home noted as Vacant/Staged with the approximate age of building noted as 48 Years Old ( Remodeled ) on Inspection Report. 

2. Contract : The appraiser claimed to have read the sales contract but indicated that there were no sales concessions which is inconsistent with the special provisions noted in the purchase agreement executed on XX/XX/2019. The sellers have agreed to pay the difference in the homestead and non-homestead tax exemption. 

3. Property Condition : The following condition rating/comment noted in the appraisal is inconsistent with the definition of rating C3 noted on the UAD Definitions Addendum on page 7, C3, Kitchen-updated-one to five years ago, Bathrooms-updated-six to ten years ago, Kitchen-updated-one to five years ago, The subject is in Average condition and constructed of average workmanship. The property is in Average functional condition and has not been impacted by external depreciation. Per the Property Condition Disclosure and XXXX Listing XXXX, the sellers, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, purchased and gained title of this unoccupied foreclosure property in XX/XX/2019. The XXXX completed a full interior and exterior renovation on the subject property that aligns with rating C2 noted in the addendum on page 7 and Remodeled level of updating classification in XXXX XXXX Selling Guide Section B4-1.3-06. 

The quality rating and definition of Q3 noted on the UAD Definitions Addendum on page 7 is inconsistent with the definition of rating Q3 and aligns with rating Q2 noted in the addendum on page 7.

4. Amenities and Garage/Carport- The selections noted in the report are inconsistent with the Subject portion of the Sales Comparison Approach section on page 2 that indicates the Porch/Patio/Deck section as Porch/Patio, No. In addition, it is inconsistent with the Additional Comments section on page 3 states, A 1.0 story detached single-family house wit 2,318 above-grade finished square feet and 0 above grade unfinished square feet with a utility / storage room. In addition, the property includes a deck, patio, porch and a 2 car  carport. 

5. Sales Comparison Approach : The miles noted in the Proximity to Subject section on page 3 and the Location Map Addendum on page 19 are inconsistent with miles verified by XXXXt. 

6. Cost Approach to Value : The following comment is inconsistent with the facts of this transaction, it should be noted that VA does not require the cost approach to value. The zoning information was derived from the local government via of a telephone call during the development process. Estimated Remaining Economic Life-HUD and VA only- 25 Years. Per review of Abbreviations Used in Data Standardization Text on page 8, VA stands for Veterans Administration. The borrower has no affiliation with the military in any capacity that warrants the Veterans Administration. 

The following clarification requests were submitted to the lender and appraiser.

1. Site Section : Borrower questions validity of following comment documented in the report, The site dimensions were derived from the local tax assessor 's office. The dimensions are approximated and were the best data available in the normal course of business. I wasn't provided with a survey to verify dimensions. The Sales Comparison Approach section on page 2 and Sketch Addendum on page 21 notes a square footage of 2,318 for the subject property. 

The Building Info section of the XXXX County MS Landroll Detail note the Base Area for the property at 2,243 sq. ft. and the Adjusted Area at 2,469 sq. ft. Square footage on property noted at 2,243 in  the XXXX system. The square footage noted in the Sketch Addendum supersedes both Tax and XXXX  records. 

In closing, I humbly request either of the following solutions : 1. Require the lender to dismiss the appraisal report and conduct an independent appraisal. 2. Perform an in-house evaluation within 3-5 business days since the transaction value is only {$190000.00} or 3. Require the appraiser to submit a revision to report to apply all missing updates to the value of the property. I have already spent hundreds of closing costs regarding this property and it will be unfair to suffer the loss due to deceptive banking practices. I appreciate your time and consideration."
Mortgage,"My family and I have been in the process of closing on our new house since the original date of XX/XX/2021. We began the mortgage process back in XXXX on the XXXX. Our loan officer at Bank of America, XXXX XXXX, has been stalling and/or unresponsive for most of this process. He will respond hours to even a few days later and never give all information slowing the process. 
For the past 3 weeks they have been telling us that they needs verification of my employment, however ; after 6 different attempts and steadily stalling it still had not been completed. We have accumulated over {$1000.00} in hotel cost, over {$200.00} in storage fees for our household items, and all he does is laugh at our experience. We have a XXXX year old daughter and dog, we should be in our house, not a hotel room. After all the stalling and lack of communication, we are looking to loose our house over this. Can you please call us once you have received this complaint at XXXX. Thanks"
Mortgage,"n XX/XX/XXXX I started having trouble paying my mortgage and soon after I reached out to XXXX for a loan modification. 
At that time the property value was approximately XXXX. 
Delay after delay and finally I get approved for my modification and after XXXX takes and deposits my XXXX payment ( document attached ) they transferred my loan to another serivicer, this is the game these banks and servicers play so they look like they are helping by granting the loan modification but then they transfer you to another serivicer who then makes you start the process over, the grueling process, and the next servicer denies you the loan mod. which they tried to do in my case. 
So after paying the new payment of XXXX a month I was transferred to BofA who then made me go through the whole process again and then increased my payment XXXX to what would have been almost XXXX a month after all the adjustments after a few years into the loan. 
After some complaining and alot of back and forth BofA switched my payment back to its original loan mod payment I was approved for by XXXX XXXX a month however they saide instead of it being fixed like the XXXX loan they will be changing it in five years and then again in another year increasing my payments by approximately XXXX-XXXX a month when it finally adjusts. 
This is not acceptable. I want the original loan modification that was originally agreed to by me and XXXX of fixed XXXX a month and I want the principal reduction that XXXX at XXXX said I was going to get, I would be getting a principal reduction as they payments were being made and the reduction would have been to its fair market at that time. 
So I am demanding that my original loan mod be put back with the principal reduction I received at the tiime XXXX approved the loan. XXXX at XXXX said in conversation to me that yes, principal reduction is part of this loan mod. as it stands now my loan balance is XXXX which is above water on the property, why are you keeping my loan underwater on a loan mod I was promised principal reduction and I want it back down to XXXX what was promised me in my original loan mod with XXXX just like you changed the payment from almost XXXX back to XXXX I want the principal reduction I was promised too. That was part of my original loan mod and I want it back. I got my payment back, but that is n't enough, I want my principal reduction back now. I had my loan mod with principal reduction and a good payment, that was all taken away when XXXX transferred me to BofA and BofA blatantly took it away, I partially got my payment back by complaining to the CEO of BofA XXXX XXXX and the CFPB etc, but they did n't restore all my payment, now I am demanding my fixed payment not increases XXXX a month for the life of the loan, and my principal reduction to the fair market value when I applied for my loan mod back XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX"
Mortgage,"I have been in foreclosure for a while and have tried to work with the bank on a few separate occasions. Last  XXXX  I went through the process with a customer service manager from Bank  of America n and tried a remodifcation. I kept giving them the information they requested, but would get a letter saying that I did not respond in time to the denied my request.     This past scenario, I got an auction sale letter by certified mail on  XXXX   XXXX  from a firm representing Bank  of America. I c alled the firm and asked how I can stop the sale and work with Ban k of America. T hey told me to work with my customer relation  manager  directly and they could assist and post-pone the sale. I immediately called to try to work it out again with BoA and was assigned a new  XXXX  to assist. Thats the thing with BoA, I can never actually speak to this person. They give me a name, and then when you call, they are never available and you have to work with the  XXXX  im on the line with and I never get to actually speak with the person who is responsible for my account.     Well I got the package form BoA along with the letter of what I needed to send them for the loan modification. I retrieved all of the files and faxed the info to them on   XXXX   XXXX  , for which I have a confirmation from MyFax services. I received a letter from BoA on  XXXX   XXXX  or  XXXX  about the extra materials they needed from me which included contacting my  XXXX  for details. This letter stated that any sales of the property would be put on hold until an answer was made in the application. It also stated I have 37 Days to complete the remodification.  Well  on   XXXX   XXXX  , the auctioneer showed up and sold my house. When I called the bank, they said there was nothing they could do at this point and to speak with their representation that handled the auction. Their representation says to talk to BoA. I am still within my 37 days and am trying HARD to make sure I do n't lose this house, but BoA is making difficult, almost on purpose it feels. I have  2 y oung kids and I am in a place now where I can make payments where I was n't when I got into the mess I am. I just want to make things right with BoA and start making payments and not lose my home."

I feel that I was provided inferior service because I filed bankruptcy in my past. I am aware that none of the statues or laws guarantees that I would be extended credit but they do exist to protect me from certain discriminatory practices that can cause me to be even denied an opportunity to even receive a proper consideration. I feel that I was discriminated not only because I have the bankruptcy but because I am also an XXXX XXXX ( the lender knew this because my picture is on my email profile when emails are being sent back and forth ) female. My application was dragged on an on for almost two months. I sent follow up emails to which many went unanswered. At one point I even requested to be transferred to a different loan officer that perhaps specialized in dealing with getting manual underwriting approval and was met with a ego. After being given the run around for over 45 days I was told I should try another lender. I also, called and spoke with her manager and never received a return call as promised. Now Interest rates have shot up and I will end up having to pay more that I expected to pay."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2013, signed and accepted a Loan Modification Agreement ( FHA-HAMP Modification w/ Partial Claim ). The agreement we both signed did NOT explain or document that Bank of America would place a second deed of trust recorded on XX/XX/2013 ( Instrument # XXXX XXXX-XXXX ) in the amount of {$85000.00}. Note The Trial Modification documentation with our signatures agreeing to the terms were submitted during the eligibility phase, which Bank of America required multiple pre-signed notary acknowledgements. ( Please see California Notary Acknowledgement dated XX/XX/2013). We did not agree nor was made aware of this lien of {$85000.00} as part of the loan modification trial period or permanent modification, otherwise we would not have agreed to such an enormous amount of money. The financial documentation with our signatures agreeing to the terms of the trial modification were submitted during the eligibility phase, therefore not being forthcoming about the {$85000.00} lien trust upfront. Also, we provided multiple copies from a notary dated XX/XX/2013 that Bank of America used to complete the Modification Agreement. Hence appearing as though we were aware initially about the partial claim amount. There is definitely nothing noted in this Loan Modification Agreement dated XX/XX/2013 document that speaks to the amount of {$85000.00}. Please see Loan Modification Agreement, XX/XX/2013, # 4  ( 1 ) The FHAs subordinate lien will require a balloon payment when I pay off, sell, or refinance the Property, which may make these things more difficult to do. The FHAs subordinate lien may also make it more difficult to get additional subordinate lien financing.

Therefore, there was a breach of contract and Fraud on Bank of Americas part. 
To state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege that ( 1 ) there was a valid contract ; ( 2 ) the defendant breached its duties under that agreement ; and ( 3 ) the breach caused the plaintiff damage. Guckenberger v. Boston Univ., 957 F. Supp. 306, 316 ( D. Mass. 1997 ) ( citations omitted ). A valid contract requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. See Vadnais v. NSK Steering Sys. Am., Inc. , 675 F. Supp.2d 205, 207 ( D. Mass. 2009 ). 
We are requesting to be released from this fraudulent lien of {$85000.00} and this mortgage to be removed from all three credit bureaus."
Mortgage,"I inherited a condo from my mother after she passed away. Bank of America holds the mortgage on it. In summary, after sending in the executor information multiple times ( I even walked them into a branch and received documentation that they received ). Bank of America continued to say that I had not sent the docs and would not take payments from me as I was "" not an approved person to speak to ''. As a result, I not only incurred XXXX of dollars of late fees, but ultimately the loan was put into foreclosure. I was finally able to pay the balance, but in the end have incurred over {$1200.00} of fees because of their incompetence, let alone the hours and hours and hours that I spent trying to rectify this. While I am now received statements and am able to pay the loan, if I call to ask any questions - for example, I 've been trying to set this up for payment on line -- they still insist that they do not have any of my documentation and they ca n't help me. The loan has now been sold to XXXX XXXX, who is saying that they ca n't speak to me because they have no documentation that I am the executor. I am copying you on a letter that I sent to XXXX XXXX, the CEO of Bank of America, both by email as well as in hard copy on multiple occasions, with no response. My ultimate objective is to 1 ) be sure that the banks acknowledge that they have my documents stating that I am an executor and that they can talk to me/take payments from me/set up on line payment with me, and 2 ) receive a refund or credit of the over {$1200.00} in fees I incurred over the course of this process. If I was not as persistent, aggressive, and knowledgeable as I am, I may have lost the condo to foreclosure -- it occurred to me that there could be XXXX if not XXXX of people that would not have been as persistent nor had the knowledge to get something done, and would have unnecessarily lost their home -- this is unacceptable! That combined with the fact that I 've had XXXX response from anyone with the multiple complaint letters and phone calls I 've submitted is truly scary.."
Mortgage,"I applied for a mortgage with Bank of America. I got a prequalification letter on XX/XX/XXXX. I decided to go with Bank of America because of a grant program they had. I was ultimately denied for the grant because I normally make $ XXXX a year and the grant income limit was $ XXXX a year. I met the $ XXXX income requirement due to COVID my employer reduced our pay by 20 % for 3 months. This was stated on the Verification of Employment they sent to my employer on XX/XX/XXXX. However the underwriter only looked at the current gross pay stated on the form by the employer and not the YTD income or notes. I was denied for the loan XX/XX/XXXX due to not having enough of a down payment due to COVID they require a 15 % down payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America charged me for an appraisal fee which I was told would be refunded on XX/XX/XXXX when the loan was cancelled. I was told the appraisal didn't happen and they would refund my credit card. The original charge was for {$660.00}. Part of that was a fee for obtaining my credit statement. I think the fee was {$25.00}. I asked for the amount in an email to the lending officer XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX but have not heard back from her. I was refunded {$200.00} from Bank of America on XXXX. I disputed the charge with my credit card company XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX due to not being able to get a response from Bank of America on the remaining charge and the appraisal not being done. XXXX closed the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX due to insufficient evidence. I was never given a receipt for this appraisal fee or credit fee. I called XXXX and Bank of America today XX/XX/XXXX to continue to try to get this resolved. I left a voicemail for XXXX XXXX since no one else at Bank of America will talk to me when I can't get a hold of her. XXXX said they will have their dispute department call me. I wanted to submit the complaint because this whole thing has been troublesome. I'm not sure how long it usually takes for a loan to be processed/reviewed but I think there should be more work done up front to make the prequalification letter meaningful. Bank of America should have gotten the Verification of Employment from my employer before issuing me a prequalification letter. It took from finding the home on XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to find out I wasn't actually approved for the mortgage."
Mortgage,"My property was damaged in a storm on  X/XX/2017   . Bank of America required us to get them to endorse the insurance check, which is normal policy for most institutions. The endorsed insurance check, required contractor information, and insurance estimate were sent via overnight mail to B of A on  X/XX/2017    and an overnight return envelope with postage paid was provided for rush requests, per the instructions on their website. I have called on numerous occasions and I am always told that they are working on it. Today,  X/X/2017   , I was told that the "" first {$20000.00} was released on  X/XX/2017    '' but that the remainder of the funds will not be released to us until they get my contractor set up as a vendor. The expected date for that is  X/XX/2017   .  <P/> As of today,  X/X/2017   , I still do n't have the funds that were supposedly released and once they are received, the paper check will require over a week to clear, even though I asked that they direct deposit the funds so I can get the repairs started. The delays in this process could be causing additional damage to my home, which will definitely cause unnecessary hardship for our family. Please let me know what can be done to get this process fixed. I have never seen an institution hold funds for this amount of time, when there is work on a property that has to be done."
Mortgage,"I have a VA home loan and the home loan servicer is Bank of America. I received a Notice of Default and it states "" The current owner of the Note secured by the Deed of Trust is XXXX a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America. XXXX. I contacted a housing counseling XXXX. The counselor stated I could submit the packet for the XXXX Program. There is relocation assistance of {$10000.00}. The housing counselor stated she could not find my name and address on the XXXX website. I submitted the packet to Bank of America. I started making repairs to the property. During XXXX there was a XXXX hold placed on the property which lasted until XXXX. I contacted the VA Loan Technician and asked for an extension. The original foreclosure sale date was XXXX and was moved to XXXX. I had been in contact with a B of A, Customer Relationship Manager, until approximately XXXX. I received a letter that person will no longer be my single point of contact later my calls were being handled by customer service. Several times while speaking with the CRM I mentioned the relocation assistance and asked about disbursement once the property is sold. Around XXXX XXXX, the XXXX hold was removed. I had never received an explanation as to why a hold had been placed on the property or what I should expect. On XXXX XXXX, I found out that the property was scheduled for auction the next day. I told a supervisor that no one told me the property was being sold. I wanted to do a short sale and get relocation assistance. I told him I did n't have a single point of contact any longer. He stated "" no one was reviewing my account that 's why. '' The date was changed to XXXX XXXX. A couple of days later in XXXX, a new CRM called me asked what I planned to do. I explained a short sale and again asked about the relocation assistance. He stated I could not participate in this program because of the type of loan I have. I mentioned no one has told me that before and the first CRM knew my intentions. He mentioned he would be talking to me once and someone else would be my CRM. In the meanwhile they sent me another mortgage assistance package. I have a letter stating I can do a short sale but it does not mention relocation assistance which is what I wanted. I wrote a Qualified Written Request to Bank of America, to verify who the Lender/Investor is. The reply was "" the Investor is XXXX as the Trustee for XXXX XXXX Trust XXXX which has an address XXXX. I called XXXX to verify the information. They looked up my name and address and said the account was "" inactive '', "" liquidated '', and they could n't help me. I had even obtained the XXXX loan number after they advised me to call B of A and get it. I wrote to the VA Loan Technician and explained the situation. He reached out to Bank of America and asked about the Investor. The reply he received back is "" The relation to XXXX was communicated incorrectly. The subset that the loan is in is a group of repurchased loans from XXXX which explains why they do not show to own it. '' My information does n't populate on XXXX loan look up. The housing counselors are relying on the information they find online to determine which program a customer might use. Eventually, someone was able to identify the Investor as a Trust. I had no way of knowing which mortgage assistance program I should have been considering. Bank of America provided the wrong information on my Notice of Default. I was unable to participate in any assistance program. I faxed a letter to B of A attorney 's stating the problem. They did not cancel the auction and proceeded to sell the property."
Mortgage,"To who it may concern, My name is XXXX XXXX. My complaint is for Bank of America! We are trying to refinance our home for a lower interest rate but Bank of America has very uncooperative. On XXXX 2013 we got a letter from Bank of America saying that our account had been sold to XXXX XXXX Services. So all these years we having been paying XXXX XXXX XXXX and now that we are trying to refinance Bank of America says we owe them {$80000.00}. Imagine my surprise to hear that I owe Bank of America that amount of money! So I called Bank of America to get a letter saying that we owe them that money to include it on our refinance or where that amount came from. So when I made that call it took me 7 calls and 7 transfers with 7 dropped calls where they would say they were transferring me to a supervisor and they would hang up on me. Bank of America told me they could not give me a letter because I owed that amount and their collection department ca n't give me a letter either because they have nothing under my social security # or account. XXXX XXXX XXXX has no record of nothing under that amount when our account was sold to them. I was not aware that I could put a complaint against them. It has been a very frustrating process with Bank of America, rude, unprofessional and certainly not Helpful!!! We are 3 days away from losing our 3 % intrest rate due to their uncooperative behavior. If we lose it who knows if we will get our appraisal money back from this company."
Mortgage,"This is the 5th time in 4 years that I have submitted a request with the required documentation to Bank of America to modify my XXXX mortgage. The previous reasons for decline have been : 1.I make too much . 2. I do n't make enough money. 3. This is n't my primary residence. 4. I am not delinquent. It seems to me that BofA is not reviewing my request ( s ) in good faith. Because their stated reasons make no sense. How can I make too much money and then not make enough $ when my income has not changed except for XXXX over the past 5+ years. I have lived in this house exclusively for almost 20 years. I was not delinquent because of the fear of foreclosure, since this is my ONLY residence. I have become delinquent simply to comply with their last request, but only 1 payment. I have asked them to change my due date from the XXXX of the month to the XXXX of the month to coincide with my soc security. They said that they could n't, therefore I 've accrued multiple late charges. As a result, I have been forced to file bankruptcy. I have completely lost faith in BofA, therefore I am filing this complaint and seeking as much help as possible for them to honestly and professionally review my request for a modification. I was steered into this predatory 6.25 % interest only loan for 10 years in XX/XX/XXXX at which time my payments will increase about XXXX %, in XX/XX/XXXX from {$1000.00} to XXXX+/-. Because of BofA 's indifference, I am forced to file Bankruptcy. Included in my income is VA XXXX ( significant hearing loss ). When asked for a BoA manager to review my situation, I was transferred to XXXX XXXX, who admitted that he was new at the job, therefore had his XXXX with him. When I told my story they seemed uninterested and felt that since they were in a position of power, they excitedly said they would foreclose rather than review or entertain my situation. Unprofessional and uncompassionate to say the least. 
Thank you for listening to me."
Mortgage,"Welcome XXXX XXXX [ Logout ] Case number : XXXX have not heard anything since XX/XX/XXXX and this lender is going to continue with foreclosure proceedings. I got a copy of a request for a stay of foreclosure that seemed like it said the company was going to help me keep my home but last week received a withdrawal of that request along with a statement that they intended to proceed with foreclosure. 
I have hired a lawyer XXXX XXXX and he intends to file for a motion for dismissal because I guess the lender and collector are n't supposed to work separately in Maine so what they are trying to do is illegal. 
In the mean time XXXX Bank of New York Melon is trying to foreclose on me XXXX is going to process yet another modification application to help me but I will probably just get another offer for XXXX + per month because the back amount owed continues to rise as I face uncertainty. 
I still maintain that XXXX XXXX XXXX said they were transferring my mod to XXXX and they would contact me if they needed information which they did not do until 3-4 months later when I finally received a bill which by this time was too high for me to catch up. 
I feel that these lenders took over my loan for pennies on the dollar as an easy target for foreclosure and an opportunity to re sell for full cost and triple their profit. 
These practices need to be stopped somehow. Did they not recently lose a lawsuit because of illegal practices? Do they even own my loan since it was a fallout from XXXX filing bankruptcy and illegally transferring notes to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I would like this investigated as well."
Mortgage,"I applied for refinancing the mortgage loan with BOA XX/XX/XXXX there was a special promotion that I could refinance my home loan for 30 year loan at 3.75 % and up to {$1000.00} for the cost of the loan fees. 
Loan Consultant took all my information and stated that it will be taken care of in 6 weeks. 
I had told him that after 8 weeks from application I was going out XXXX for 5 weeks. 
It has been over 9 months I have done applications 3 x s total now in the last application I was advised to do a cash out for my equity line of credit at extra cost of $ XXXX {$300.00}. 
About 3 weeks BOA started offering me current deals whereas for nine months the loan consultant was assuring me that I will get the same deal that was offered to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 
In the mean time I had invested {$650.00} towards the loan fee as appraisal fee XXXX application fee and 2 x s credit check. 
I spoke to XXXX the loan department to get the refund of the money I had invested as I wasted more than 9 months of my time at times talking to XXXX people in the loan department for various questions. 
I application was dismissed as the time had lapsed and they did not get papers XXXX we have a new XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX so when they informed me that there are delinquencies I called XXXX and in 2 days the records were cleared and information was given but by then application time expired, so the loan consultant started a new application and assured me that I will still get 3.75 % and total fee will not exceed {$1000.00} which included the appraisal fee, credit check fee and the XXXX fee I had paid during the first application. I asked the loan consultant to expedite as it had been & gt ; than five months since the initial application. He told me that people waiting to move in was a priority over refinance.During that time I refinanced my other loan that I had taken from BOA XX/XX/XXXX, with Nationstar mortgage lender XX/XX/XXXX. 
So as the XXXX application was expiring they closed it stating that my income debt ratio was high and the BOA could not give me the loan and after I clarified that my income debt ratio was actually less than what it was on XX/XX/XXXX the loan consultant started a XXXX application and advised me to add cash out and pay off my equity line of credit and he would maintain 3.75 % interest rate and my total fees for the loan will be $ XXXX {$300.00} more added to the {$1000.00}. XXXX total fee promised on XX/XX/XXXX. So more that nine months later BOA was negotiating with on current interest rates and charging $ XXXX {$3000.00} for loan fees. 
I spoke to various people including the regional chief every one had inconsistent comments chief said it became complicated as I added cash out and consultant said that because loan amount without cash out is less than {$100000.00} so the fees will be higher. 
So wasted 10 months of my time and energy at times there was a gap of 1 month between phone calls from the processor of the loan XXXX processor said that my loan is ready to be signed, second one called me and said that I needed another appraisal and bank would pay for it and still put it on my credit card on the file without my permission and with much effort and multiple phone calls I had that removed.Now the BOA wants to start a new application XXXX XXXX at 3.75 % no pints but the fee of loan will be current charges so they are changing the whole deal from XX/XX/XXXX which I have declined and have asked them to refund {$650.00} that I invested and I do not want to do business with them any more. 
It was a very harassing experience with multitude of phone calls and talking to so many different people. 
I had a similar experience with them XX/XX/XXXX when I took mortgage for the condo from the bank at time of finalizing loan they increased the interest rate and cost of loan and delayed the loan by 3 weeks and caused us lot of hardship and stress.

Credit card or prepaid card,"First, thanks to the consumer financial protection department for giving me their help in solving this problem. It all starts on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I open a page called XXXX. Since I opened your page, the XXXX XXXX XXXX started charging {$12.00} and {$1.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from my XXXX XXXX credit card. These two fees were charged twice to my credit card without my consent, for that reason I made the decision to call the bank to report those charges as fraud, then the bank made the decision to block the credit card and the merchant sending free so that I would not continue charging. After the bank conducted the commercial fraud investigation, they returned their money to the bank for a total of {$29.00} of the 4 transactions the company had charged to the bank. A few days after the bank had fixed everything with the credit card where they committed the fraud, the charges were removed from the new card that the bank had sent me. After about a week that the bank had already cashed the company 's money, the bank started charging me {$14.00} a fee that the merchant had already paid and they want to charge me, then I call the bank and I speak with several representatives and also with Supervisor to see if someone could help me solve the problem, but none of them solved the problem. The day I spoke with the bank supervisor, I explained the situation and asked why they charged me that rate if the company had already paid their money and I told them that I did not have to pay that money because it is a fraudulent money that they reported and they recovered it because When they return a money in the credit card that says that the money is not mine and that means it goes directly to them, she said that I do not have to pay anything, so I asked her if I do not have to pay anything why that transaction is in my credit account as if I had to pay and after asking that question, she kept quiet because she knew that I was telling the truth and I also told her that if she did not have to pay that money, why? Do not delete that transaction from my account? Then she gave me several excuses to contradict me and confuse me to pay. For that reason, I ask for help for the financial protection of the consumer, because what the bank is doing to me I see it as a fraud because it is charging me money that I should not pay. If you need any proof to help with the case, let me know and I will gladly send it to you and thank you very much for your cooperation."
Credit card or prepaid card,I filed a fraud claim with Bank of America and they didn't even attempt to investigate my case. They closed it out immediately without reason.

I'm also asking for your assistance in this matter. Thank you.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have the Bank of America Travel Rewards Visa card.

However in the last three statements : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX I have illegally been charged a {$1.00} fee on the XXXX of each of these three months, despite the fact that I was assessed {$0.00} fees for any interest. 

I called and complained to Bank of America and after 20 minutes of back and forth and being put on hold each time with some ridiculous explanation which CLEARLY is a violation of the card stipulations that states : Here is the excerpt from the contract : Minimum Interest Charge If you are charged interest, the charge will be no less than {$1.00}. 

Therefore, since I dont pay ANY interest, this CAN NOT apply. 

My concern is not the small about, rather the EXTREMELY fraudulent actions of Bank of America, which I am certain is being perpetrated against the millions of people who hold this card and most likely any Bank of America cards or other financial products as this is a charge deliberately entered into their computer system and then assessed automatically. 

Please research all of Bank of Americas abusive practices along with those of other financial institutions which may also be engaging in these types of fraudulent thefts. 

{$1.00} is small enough for most people to ignore, but multiplied by the millions of accounts is on a massive order of magnitude.

If I were notified of the ending date of the 0 % Promotional APR, I would have paid off all the balance in time to avoid high interest rate. 

As a consumer, I feel its unfair for the bank to ignore or fail to notify or alert the consumer about the critical timeline/date that have a dramatic impact on their interest/benefit such as change of the interest rate. Their failure to do so is apparently an action of taking advantage of their consumers. I hope Bank of America can fix their policy to prevent this problem."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase for {$7.00} on my Bank of America credit card, a XXXX ending in XXXX. I have had the account in good standing since opening in XXXX, XXXX. The statement posted on XX/XX/XXXX and payment was due XX/XX/XXXX. I unfortunately forgot to pay, it slipped my mind. But I received no reminder emails about the missed payment and I had electronic delivery set up. So my account went from late payment to 30 day missed payment, and then 60 day missed payment, all with no contact from Bank of America. I finally noticed the payment was due when I saw it in my personal finance aggregator app ( XXXX XXXX, now called XXXX ). I paid it immediately, XX/XX/XXXX. Again, no late fee was charged to indicate something was wrong, nor any notice of late payment. 
In XXXX of XXXX, I noticed my account was closed. My credit report states is was closed XX/XX/XXXX. I had to call Bank of America, who would not disclose the reason for the account closing. I was informed that I would get a letter in the mail, which never came. I called back in XXXX of XXXX and was informed again that nothing could be disclosed and that I would get a letter in the mail. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and I have received no letter. 
I believe Bank of America set me up for failure, as I now have two negative remarks on my credit report and they refuse to communicate with me about the payment or the account closure. I feel the situation would be rectified if the late payment remarks could be removed from my credit report since they also played a role in lack of communication about the missing payment and later failed to follow their own instructions that I would receive a letter with details."

Additionally, I noticed that once I clicked the payment button, all of my accounts appeared readily available to accept payments. This is preposterous, as only  XXXX  of those accounts appear when I login - my business, and  XXXX  credit card. Bank of Americ a ( BoA ) is tryin g to subject me to money laundering by having these accounts open but not giving me the ability to use each ... Additionally, not accepting payments or rather, not presenting a customer proof of payment is egregious."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America has not been processing my credit card payments. 

It has been giving me no indication of why this is and hasn't helped when i have called them about it. 

I had contacted XXXX about this issue and they say it is not on their end. Bank of America just declines and doesn't even inform me. 

This has caused me to incur rampant interest charges and ruined my credit with one of my credit cards that I had assumed was paid off by Bank of America."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America has closed all of my accounts without my consent. It includes all of my checking, savings, brokerage and credit card accounts. I have paid everything off on top in full. On top of that, they have not let me withdrawn any of the credit card points that I have earned with them. I have accumulated XXXX points, which is worth at least {$2500.00}."

I have called customer support and they were unable to explain to me why this happened."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2020 my Bank of America card was closed. I had {$3200.00} in my account when it was closed and my money was removed. I have tried endlessly to get this money back. I guess my account was flagged as fradulent. I have called AZ DES, emailed XXXX XXXX 's office, XXXX XXXX to no avail. I had a contact at DES who would actually call me back. Now I am afraid she is gone - I have called 4 times and no return call. 

I contact BOA and was told that it was AZ DES who had to fix this problem. AZ DES also told me it was BOA who had to fix this. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I think 5 months is just ridiculous with no answers. 

I have attached a copy of my statement from BOA showing the deduction and closure of the account."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 30 days late payment on the dates XX/XX/2018. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."

Between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX I moved apartments, my official move in date was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. From XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America sent annual fee statements to the incorrect address. Finally, once I noticed the late payment on my credit report I contacted BOA and updated my address and immediately made a payment. I was originally told there should not be an issue getting this removed, but I 've made countless attempts to dispute this both through BOA and the credit bureaus to no avail. About 1-2 months ago I was told by a BOA representative that there was nothing they could do about this and I needed to directly contact each credit bureau. After speaking to a customer service rep at one of the credit bureaus I was notified that I should have never been directed to them and this is an issue that needs to be handled thru BOA. After several disputes, including one through XXXX which has an option to dispute via XXXX XXXX for statement sent to incorrect address please remove late payment, the only thing BOA continues to do is verify that the late payment is correct and no removal is made."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Approx. XX/XX/2017, after reviewing the charges on my credit card, I became aware that I had been the victim of identity theft. I promptly notified Bank of America, reported the identity theft to the credit bureau and filed a police report. Despite timely notice, Bank of America continued to allow charges from foreign countries to accrue, despite the fact that I never visited these countries. The total amount Bank of America allowed to accrue is over {$600000.00}, despite the {$3700.00} credit limit and the timely notice of disputed charges. I had to hire an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX letters to Bank of America and despite the certified mailing being signed for, Bank of America stated it was received or was sent to the wrong dept. After resending the letter to the correct address provided by Bank of America, they stated the same thing after signing for the certified mail sent to the addresses they provided. I have personally physically went into the branch and filed a complaint to no avail. I was unable to purchase a new home because of the adverse reporting of Bank of America on my credit report."
Credit card or prepaid card,On Friday XX/XX/21 I received notification from XXXX of a hard inquiry from Bank of America. I immediately called XXXX and was redirected to Bank of America. I called the bank and the representative was unable to verify based off security questions so I was sent into a branch. The branch did not see anything and I was told not to worry. This morning I received an email from Bank of America the denial and reference number # XXXX. I then contacted XXXX who has since placed a file lock on my account and I was told I had to file a report in order to have the inquiry removed from my report. I have been unsuccessful with Bank of America with speaking to an agent and it is very frustrating.

I do not feel Bank of America should get to keep the expired funds approximately $ XXXX {$200.00}. I was mailed the card, so Bank of America has my mailing address as well as my email address to notify me of pending expiration. 

I feel Bank of America should extend the period or because they have the ability to discourage the use of the card until the end of the expiration period. This is another way they can create a profit center.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a Bank of America XXXX credit card. I have been making the minimum payments for a little while now, and the balance isn't really going down at all, so I decided to increase my monthly payment to something more substantial. I went to their website XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but the only options are A : Minimum payment due, or B : Entire balance. 

On XX/XX/2023, I spent more than an hour on support chat with a company representative to try to solve it. The representative insisted that there was a way to do it. We removed my existing autopay and tried to set it up again XXXX different times, but there still was no option to pay an arbitrary amount. My issue got escalated to someone from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had a call with her XX/XX/2023 ( XXXX XXXX ) and she walked me through the process twice while she also did it with her own card, and came to the same conclusion, that there is no way to schedule payments that are MORE than the minimum amount due, unless it is for the ENTIRE amount. She explained to me that they USED to have that ability, but it was presumably removed. 

I'm not sure if this is illegal, but it sure seems like it should be. It very much seems like their intention is to keep people making interest-only payments on their card, so they can keep them in a cycle of debt for as long as possible. 

My issue has not been resolved, and the suggestion from the XXXX XXXX was "" Just schedule them manually ''"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My credit card number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was valid through XXXX XXXX credit card, which I never received, ending in XXXX, was issued and sent by Bank of America XXXX BoA XXXX to replace my old credit card, which was about to expire. 

On XXXX XXXX I looked at my BoAs webpage and found out a fraudulent purchase was made on XXXX XXXX XXXX at EASY AMERICAS XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, using the credit card I neither received nor activated. I immediately called BoA to make a claim for this fraudulent charge, and on XXXX XXXX the bank credited my account for {$2100.00} plus the FOREIGN FEE ADJUSTMENT for {$63.00}. On XXXX XXXX I received an email from BoA confirming a credit for {$2100.00} was made to my account. 

On XXXX XXXX I received an alert saying that my credit card payment was due soon, for me it was a surprise, since I hadnt used my credit card and wrongly assumed the fraud claim was closed. When I checked out my credit card balance, I found out the credit was reversed on XXXX XXXX and that according to BoA I owed {$2100.00}. Its important to mention that I never received a letter and/or electronic message from BoA informing me about the decision of the claim. I talked over the phone with a bank representative who told me the bank would reopen the case, advised me not to pay for the charges ( even the minimum payment for {$25.00} XXXX, and told me to wait for an email from BoA about the claim. 

Since I never received the email, I called again on XXXX XXXX, and talked to a second bank representative who advised me to pay the minimum payment fee in order to avoid any charges for late payment fees. Also, she told me that I wouldnt receive any communication from the bank about the claim and to wait for two billing cycles to find out if the fraudulent dispute was approved on my behalf. 

Since the information given by the two bank representatives was contradictory, I decided to call a third time on XXXX XXXX, and talked to a third bank representative who confirmed the claim was reopened, and advised me to wait for the claim to go through its process. She also said it could take up to two billing cycles for the bank to provide an answer, that I shouldnt pay for the minimum payment fee, and that I am not liable for any late payments fees through the duration of the process. 

However, looking at my BoAs webpage, I found out that I have already been charged on XXXX 2nd, for late payment fees. Also, even though every representative has told me the claim is open, in my BoAs webpage it appears as if it was closed which to me is worrisome. 

In sum : 1 ) I never received thecreditcard ending in XXXX 2 ) The above points outsecurity issuesatBoAsmailing protocol, of which I am not and should not be liable. 
XXXX ) According to BoAs protocol, the new credit card couldnt have been used without prior activation. Since I did not receive it and consequently I did not activate it, this shows security issues in XXXX activation protocol, of which I am not and should not be liable. 
4 ) To date, I have not received any formal or informal, written or verbal explanation of the reasons why the case was reopened. In case of lack of information I have the right to assume that the information I officially got and that is reflected on my webpage is the correct information. 

In connection with all the above, I request BoA to : 1 ) definitely close my case. 
2 ) reverse all the charges regarding the purchase I did not make, and reverse any charges for late payment on my credit card. 
3 ) Inform me by letter or via email of the confirmation of the decision to close the case, in a duly and timely manner."

On XX/XX/2020, Bank of America suddenly closed my credit card without giving me a chance to redeem the reward points. This is a classic bait & switch tactic. Bank of America earned credit card processing fees because of my card usage. By denying my ability to redeem these rewards points, Bank of America kept all their credit card processing fees thanks to my business, but refusing to give me the credit card rewards as promised."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America and the XXXX XXXX Reward Card is fraudulently keeping my {$75.00} annual fee despite repeated requests to close the card and have my fee returned. They have not removed a {$28.00} late fee or rescinded a credit bureau report as promised, on several occasions. Two requests made to escalate this situation to a manger were never completed despite being told a request would be entered with a specific timeframe given to me. I would like Bank of America to review the tapes of all of my phone calls to see what was promised to me as a customer, and what should have transpired. 
XX/XX/XXXX : The annual fee posted. According to their literature, they will credit the account for the annual fee if you close the account within 30 days of receiving the statement on which the annual fee is billed. That bill was not received by XX/XX/XXXX, which is when I made my first call to Bank of America. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke with XXXX XXXX and discovered I had a small charge and had received a late fee. Additionally, I was told I had been reported to the credit bureau. I asked to have the late fee and interest rebated. I was told she would remove the late fee but not the interest. I was also informed that the credit reporting would be rescinded. I asked to have the annual fee removed and was told I would have to close the account, to which I agreed. At that point I made a payment of {$85.00} which would cover all charges except for the late fee and annual fee. Confirmation # XXXX. In terms of completing my request to close the account and have the annual fee returned, I was sent to another person. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke with XXXX XXXX. I reiterated all of my requests and was told the card would be closed, the annual fee returned, the late fee waived and the credit bureau reporting rescinded. 
Soon after that I received a bill which clearly indicated none of the above, promised actions had occurred. At that point I called Bank of America again. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke with XXXX XXXX. She read the notes and stated she was very surprised that none of the above had occurred! She told me she would perform all of the actions needed. She entered a claim # XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX called and told me her ( my ) request for all of the actions had been rejected. The late fee would not be removed. The credit bureau reporting would not be rescinded and my annual fee would not be returned. I asked if my card was still open and she said yes. For the third time, over the course of six weeks, I asked for my card to be closed. I was told it would be and did receive ( finally ) a confirmation letter. At this point, I asked to escalate all of this to an escalation manager. I was told one would call within 24-48 hours. This did not occur. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke with XXXX XXXX. I was told that he could see why my prior requests had failed. He was going to put in another (! ) request to remove the late fee and rescind the credit bureau reporting but could not remove the annual fee. I mentioned my unfulfilled request, through XXXX XXXX, to speak with a manager and was told We are very busy here. Seriously? Im pretty busy too and even more so since I have to continue pursuing these justifiable actions to my account. I then asked to have an escalation manager call to address the annual fee and confirm all other actions would be completed. I was told I would receive a phone call within 24-72 hours. 
It is now more than 72 hours later. I do not know if the late fee was rebated. I do not know if the credit bureau report was rescinded. The card was finally closed but no portion of the annual fee has been returned. This is fraudulent behavior on the part of Bank of America!"

Received a letter from Bank of America dated XX/XX/XXXX to call the service line to unfreeze my account. Call the number only to be told they can't do anything to unfreeze it.

However under the column "" Balance subject to interest '' it shows a larger, wrong amount which does not reflect the payments. Bank of America is charging interest based on a larger, wrong amount, thus robbing their customers that carry a balance. The bank also closed another credit card account, without prior notice, even when I had maintained current on all payments. This had damaged my credit, without a cause."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Dear CFPB, After more than 15 years with my Bank of America credit card and accumulated more than {$3000.00} dollars of reward points, Bank of America decided to close my account due to 2 months of inactivity. 
Due to the circumstances and current economic crisis, I decided not to use my credit card. I truly believe one is force to use their credit card if financially not stable. Bank of America uses tactics and promotions for you to use your CC and collect rewards points which at the end they have the control over them, not you like they advertise it. Bank of America are not very specific and clear about their reward points, they only care about using your credit card as much as you can."

Today while talking to the claims dept I was told there was no letter saying the claim was resolved and the claim was still open despite the fact I was staring at a physical letter saying the opposite.The ineptitude of Bof A is frightening. The fact that they could erroneously report to the credit bureaus is also frightening. I just hung up from 1.5 hrs on the phone. B of A assures me the matter will be remedied. Obviously I do not trust them. They say they are sending me a check that I have to deposit into my credit union account.

Then BofA charged interest on my balance since the payment didn't post until Monday. I reached out to them and they credited my account for the interest, but I want this to go on the record because this probably happens to a lot of customers and they just pay the interest."

Attached documents shows that I never missed any payment, and two out of three credit cards are fully paid off. when I call on the number and I was told my account is flagged for money laundering and I have no clue why this happens.

The card is paid monthly in full ; I do not incur interest on my charges ( the card is used primarily for regular contributions to charities and the vendor transaction at issue was a one-off ). The refund resulted in a balance in my favor of over {$8600.00} ( the Bank owed XXXX money ). On XX/XX/2022, I transferred the {$10000.00} refund to my savings account at Bank of America. On XX/XX/2022, Bank of America assessed a {$500.00} loan fee. The Bank also assessed interest, but agreed to withdraw those charges. It refuses to reverse the loan fee because its system recognizes the {$10000.00} transfer as a cash advance ; claiming that they can do nothing about it the {$500.00} fee. 

I did not borrow {$10000.00}. I received {$10000.00} in XXXX of my Bank of America accounts and then put it into another of my Bank of America accounts. Bank of America did not loan me XXXX cent and incurred no risk or liability. Interestingly, Bank of America folk tell me that if I had only telephoned the Bank and asked a Bank person to make the transfer, rather than doing it electronically online ( which I am allowed to do ), there would have been no fee. This suggests that there is a button to push but that I, the consumer, am not allowed to push it. This sounds like theft and a gotcha to me."

Bank of America won't take cancellation calls from customers outside those times. Agents are trained to say "" We don't have access to that system ; those agents aren't in the office ''. What's more, I can't cancel online despite doing ALL my business with Bank of America - including signing up for the card and paying my bill - online.

Bank of america did not do a proper investigation, and the charges after XX/XX/XXXX are not mine. I explained multiple times to bank of america, to many representatives that my last transaction was in the amount of {$7.00} on XX/XX/2023 at XXXX XXXX. 
To my surprise, they did not return me the funds which were charged after that transaction. The total charges add up to over {$770.00}, and bank of america did not cover the liability they are supposed to cover. 
I am asking you to interfere and ask bank of america to do a proper investigation and return me the fraudulent charges which are not mines."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I submitted a payment dispute with Bank of America for an airline ticket that I had purchased. In XX/XX/2021. In early XX/XX/2021, the airline had canceled my reservation and that my ticket should now be considered void and informed me that I was due a refund. To date I have received no such refund. The relevant dates and details on the fact pattern are below : On XX/XX/2021, I purchased an airline ticket through XXXX on XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2021, I received an email from XXXX stating that my ticket had been canceled by the airline and should now be considered void. The email further stated, Refund processes have now begun to be processed back for affected tickets to the original form of payment used to make the booking. You should receive your refund as soon as possible. 
After receiving the email, I contacted both XXXX  and XXXX, which each informed me to contact the other party with questions about this refund. 
Around XX/XX/2021, I submitted a dispute with Bank of America because I had not received the promised refund. 
On XX/XX/2021, I received a letter dated XX/XX/2021, stating that my dispute was being declined because it was a situation involving a merchants return policy."
Credit card or prepaid card,On XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX company charged us a 7 % fee as part of a total charge of {$1000.00} for making payment on a XXXXXXXX XXXX card rather than the 5 % clearly stated on the contract. Bank of America so far is allowing the overcharge. I've received no explanation for why this overcharge was allowed to stand despite numerous calls to BOA.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America continues to take people 's money by letting it go into limbo between the customer and the banking systems. This is a common issue is what I was told by the customer service rep on XX/XX/2018. This isn't right. This bank is stealing money. I'm just one person but I hope this comment can start some type of investigation into this. This bank isn't being fair to the public. Yes, my issue was resolved but I had to spend days and hours doing investigation work myself with watching transactions and taking screen shots to get my issue resolved. This isn't right. No one should have to go through this."
Credit card or prepaid card,"The short version : I was shorted {$10.00} when making a withdrawal from a BofA ATM. When I submitted an ATM error claim, BofA : XXXX. Closed the claim the same day or no more than two days later as "" fraud or suspicious '' without investigating the claim. 
XXXX. Declined my grocery store purchase ( this was the way I found something was wrong since the claim denial letter arrived much later ). 
XXXX. Closed or froze XXXX depending on which rep at BofA gives the info ) all of the funds XXXX had paid me via the BofA prepaid ATM card. 
XXXX. When I tried to escalate the error, the supervisor refused to talk to me and told the phone rep to tell me "" BofA has nothing to do with it and I need to contact the sponsor '' XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX. Prevented access to all of my XXXX funds for almost three months. 
NOTE : XXXX confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my claim or account and sent me payments BofA refused because they closed/froze my account via paper checks. They continued to pay me via check until my claim ran out of funds. 

All of the details : On XX/XX/XXXX I went to a Bank of America ATM to withdraw {$250.00} in cash. The last {$10.00} bill was stuck in the ATM and retained. A few days later I called Bank of America and told them I was shorted {$10.00}. 
A few days after that I attempted to use my XXXX ATM card at a grocery store and the transaction was declined. I didn't have time to call about it at the time because I was in the process of moving. 
I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, most likely the day I filed the claim, stating "" Your claim has been closed because we believe the account or claim may have been the subject of fraud or suspicious activity. '' Since I made the withdrawal I assume this means they're accusing me of fraud? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to the prepaid claims department and they informed me that not only do I not get my {$10.00} back, but in addition, all of my funds had been frozen ( she originally told me the account was closed ) and they returned already delayed credits XXXX sent to BofA for the month of XXXX and XXXX totaling {$3200.00} back to XXXX. I couldn't believe all of this happened because of a {$10.00} ATM error claim. However, the phone rep made it sound like its quite normal and happens with almost every claim they receive for XXXX accounts. And there's nothing they will do about it. When I demanded to speak to a supervisor I was told after a lengthy wait that the supervisor refused to speak to me because it has nothing to do with BofA and I needed to speak to "" the sponsor ''. 

I must say that I truly experienced the inequity in how people are treated by BofA, especially on that last call. By the way the situation was handled and how I was spoken to, I really felt Bank of America thought I was trash and not worth their time. Ironically, later that same day XXXX received a "" Thank you for being a Preferred Rewards for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX' email from BofA with a video summary of the past year ( for my Business Account that is! ). 

I spent countless hours from XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX on the phone with BofA and XXXX, most of it on hold at BofA, trying to get access to MY FUNDS. Everyone Ive spoken with at XXXX says there is no problem on their side with my claim and there is nothing I need to do for XXXX to get access to MY FUNDS in BofA. This is evidenced by the fact that they continued to pay me by paper checks after BofA returned my {$3200.00} in back payments to XXXX. 

Until XXXX, I didn't have have access to MY FUNDS in BofA. That may be incorrect, because the first person I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX told me that the account was unfrozen on XX/XX/XXXX and I needed to talk to Tier 2 to get my ATM card working again. However, the Tier 2 rep I was transferred to after a long wait on hold very rudely told me that I was wrong because the account has a fraud block on it and I need to talk to Fraud Risk about that. She transferred me and after a lengthy hold I was disconnected. Total time of the XX/XX/XXXX call was XXXX mins XXXX sec. I decided that I had once again wasted too much time getting nowhere with BofA and instead of calling back I would call and close my business account, which BofA paid me {$700.00} to open in XXXX of last year. 

After calming down from the treatment I received on XX/XX/XXXX, on XXXX I called BofA again and FINALLY got a fraud risk phone rep who cared enough to actually figure out what was needed to free up my funds. After passing enhanced ID ( because, of course, BofA didn't have any idea who I was ... despite sending me this a few days earlier : https : XXXX? XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX XXXX, he released the block on the account and I immediately transferred the entire balance of {$970.00} to my account at XXXX XXXX. 

I am very fortunate in the fact that I did not need the money from XXXX. Whats much more important than resolution for me, and something that infuriates me every time I think about it, is the fact that many people are desperately in need their XXXX payments to feed and shelter themselves and their families. I cant begin to XXXX the pain, stress, and suffering they and their families experience every day. Its inflicted on them as a result of Bank of Americas actions and inactions and I will no longer support such a company with my business ... but I still want my {$10.00} back! 

NOTE : I destroyed the XXXX ATM card after I transferred all of the funds out of BofA. I've entered my BofA XXXX XXXX card on the next page for identification purposes."

Credit card or prepaid card,I went to make a purchase online using my credit card. The transaction was declined. My bank advised me the transaction was being routed through a XXXX bank. Soon after I started getting calls from XXXX ( a Michigan # ) trying to get information about my card for a better rate. This is clearly an attempt at executing some type of fraud.
Credit card or prepaid card,There are two credit cards taken out through Bank of America on XX/XX/2020. One was for XXXX XXXX and the other was for XXXX XXXXXXXX. I never applied for either one. Ive contacted Bank of America and I am filing a police report with my local police department.
Credit card or prepaid card,"The Bank of America ( BofA ) in their letter of XX/XX/2018 said they were unable to obtain credit for a service that's scheduled to occur at a future date. Furthermore, in the same letter ( attached ) it states that I should "" contact BofA if the merchant fails to perform the services after the scheduled time-frame has elapsed ''. The letter further states to provide documentation from the merchant to support that they have no intention of rendering the service in the future. We done this several times with BofA. 
Today, I called the BofA to inform that the merchant has no intention to deliver the service and to inform BofA once again that they have this information. I have attached what the merchant sent the bank to dispute the BofA case ( XXXX ). Per the five items listed in "" ADDENDUM '', item 3, 4, and 5 were in noncompliance in XXXX, 2018 when we did not received either a password or a website to received said service. The BofA had all documentation pertinent to service not received, since XX/XX/2018 when we filed the dispute. We again in XXXX, 2018 reach out for service and cancelled when no response was coming from the merchant. We gave BofA all the information showing the merchant at this point had shown no intent to deliver the service. 
BofA shows again in its XX/XX/XXXX that it has made no effort to dispute the merchant in my interest despite having the requested infirmation. We cancelled the service with the merchant on XX/XX/2018 after trying in good faith to get the service, and we told BofA and gave them the documentation. I attach relevant documentation showing how we tried to get what was promised in the merchant itemized ADDENDUM. The documentation we provide show that the merchant has no intention to provide the service and the bank has failed in its analysis of the case. Why then write me a letter saying to "" contact '' BofA if we did not receive the service. Again it shows that the BofA is inconsistent and is NOT TRANSPARENT in its communication. I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX in claims on XX/XX/2018 @ XXXX XXXX about the matter. She hesitated then went to consult ( I was on hold twice ) what they should do despite the evidence that we are now in the future ( several months ) and i have not received said services from the merchant. It is clear the merchant has no intention to deliver the service and BofA has failed to recognize this or has some relationship with the XXXX XXXX XXXX  and rather not deal with the situation. XXXX XXXX then said that BofA did not receive in specific information to cancel the service. My final comment is that we have followed the rules and in good faith have tried to resolved this with the merchant. It is clear that BofA has not gone to show this with the merchant. It seems, because the merchant bank is in XXXX, BofA has become timid to do the charge back as the XXXX rules requires ( no service provided ). Please see attachments for this complaint."
Credit card or prepaid card,"From XXXX XXXX thru XXXX XXXX Bank of America allowed fraudulent charges to accumulate on cc ending in XXXX, they closed that card and transferred the charges to cc ending in XXXX. A total of 434 charges at XXXX each for the same company in CA. They cleared 119 charges but refuse to clear the additional 315 charges, interest and penalties. I have been trying to resolve this for 2 months. No further communications from BOA, attempts to contact the fraud dept, appears to be a phone with a recording and no response. How do I get their attention to resolve this? I have had my credit score drop XXXX points due to this issue. A surge in spending and past due payments are being attached to my credit report. {$13000.00} of fraud is still on this closed cc.

Credit card or prepaid card,I booked a flight for my wife and I to XXXX on XX/XX/2021 and noticed I did not have our names the same as our passports. I somehow got routed to XXXX and they assured me they would change our names for {$450.00}. Our names have never been changed with XXXX XXXX and they have never heard of this company. I contacted my credit card company ( Bank of America ) and they said it happened too long ago and said to contact the company. I did and they refuse to do anything.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was defrauded, extorted and held for XXXX  by a rouge moving company. 

I have attempted to resolve with Bank of America for fraudulent chargers since XXXX / XX/XX/2022. BOA has NOT responded, as I have tirelessly asked for explanations for documents and clarifications for what they need from me. 

They have not responded to calls, emails, texts, etc. A previous case worker kept saying she would email me and call me back and she has not responded. I have asked countless times to have the case worker in the fraud / dispute department working on my case to contact me to clarify what they need so I can give to them and don't get responses. 

I did NOT hire this company, they showed up demanding large sums of money more than Double what I agreed to. 

I have an email from the federal government stating that the rouge moving companies in question have committed multiple violations and misconduct in their investigation, yet my own bank which I have had for 20+ years is not even responded to me as I attempt to resolve fraud charges."
Credit card or prepaid card,"BofA accepted payment to a closed credit card account and will not refund the credit. 

We have called customer service and all representatives said the account had been closed and that we would get a refund within 10 days. 

The online statement shows that BofA has not closed the account."
Credit card or prepaid card,"A company that has an online game with "" in-game purchases '' has been charging me for purchases I did not authorize on my Visa bank card through Bank of America. 

The company is XXXX located in XXXX. 

The game IS NOT a game that requires purchases to play because it is a "" free to play '' game, there are NO SUBSCRIPTION costs. 

When I discovered that I was being charged ever since XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Bank of America, who initially removed {$790.00} in charges on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I filed a fraud dispute at that time. 

Bank of America responded to me by refusing to honor my request to have fraudulent charges removed. The refusal letter stated that XXXX charged "" recurring subscription charges ''. This is a false statement, there are no recurring monthly charges associated with this game. 

Since then, Bank of America has added an additional {$5300.00} in charges associated with this company as well as reinstated {$790.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX has retracted more than {$1000.00} in-game credits, credits I neither authorized nor requested, even though Bank of America has reinstated the charges from XXXX. 

There is clearly a fraud being perpetrated here and Bank of America seems to be standing behind the billing company. 

I resubmitted my fraud dispute and again, Bank of America refused to remove the fraudulent charges from my account. 

My only crime was not checking more thoroughly my individual monthly transactions before paying my bill. I made monthly only payments as part of a scheduled budget."
Credit card or prepaid card,My card was skimmed at a atm so my information was stolen. I disputed the charge and got the money credited back to account. Bank of america didnt close the card i reported stolen so my money was taken again. Now they have made my account negative and is taking my unemployment im getting and putting it towards negative balance. When i call the claims department i never get through ive waited on my phone for 3 hours and never get to speak to anyone.
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XXXX of last year, {$1000.00} had been withdrawn from my prepaid Bank of America XXXX card. I did not give anybody my card or pin number nor did I authorize anybody to use my card ever as one Bank of America phone representative insinuated. After I had discovered the missing funds and reported what happened to Bank of America, I received a letter from them all of three days later stating that my account seems to have been involved in some fraud and the case was closed. I called BofA again and asked why nobody had investigated and how could they just ignore my claim like that. The representative told me to write an appeal letter reiterating that I did not authorize the transaction in anyway nor give out my pin number and to please conduct a proper investigation. I did as instructed and faxed the letter over to the number she gave me on XX/XX/2020. By XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America 's response was to freeze my entire account which had {$2300.00} in it and left me with no money at all. I made numerous phone calls only to be insulted by employees or to be told that I was just one of hundreds of thousands of people which did not help. I wrote them a letter again on XX/XX/XXXX, and again on XX/XX/XXXX. Finally, the {$2300.00} was released on XX/XX/XXXX and that was the end of it. I was right back where I started when I first called to complain about the missing money. They apparently still have not bothered to investigate, they won't cover the loss as even their own website states and they will not do anything to help me with this. They didn't even send me any kind of courtesy notice either when they froze my account. I am yet again requesting that Bank of America replace this {$1000.00} stolen from my account as they are supposed to assist when a customer has been a victim of fraud not make the situation even worse for them. I will never use their card again, because it obviously is not safe and offers no protection for consumers. I am tired of trying to deal with them and would just like the money stolen from my account to be returned. They clearly have no intentions of taking any actions on my behalf."
Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/2021 went to Bank of America ATM machine to make a payment put {$400.00} in the machine the machine sent back a printed statement saying they were unable to process and can not return my items which is {$400.00} I called the number they gave me they assured me it would be taken care of insideThe girl told me it happens to her its frustrating but they will take care of it immediately its almost 2 months now nothing I keep paying interest on this {$400.00} I went to the bank and ask them to take care of it they said they have nothing to do with the credit cards but yet the credit card says Bank of America on it my statements come from Bank of America and they refused to do anything

It said that I had withdrew it from the atm but I had not even visited Bank of America this is to much coincidence since I had just gotten deposited money into that account from the EDD I had not really used the card for the same reason of hearing so many stores of people stealing the information on those cards. My issue is this is ridiculous how can a debit card that is supposed to be safe, they stole XXXX $ dollars in a heart beat and no one is doing anything this is money I need to pay my rent and all they are saying is oh its gon na take 90 days are they gon na pay my late fees for rent I think not Bank of America has done this with me multiple times but unfortunately this is the bank the EDD is in contract with.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021, I went on Spirit.com to purchase my airfare reservations. Once I selected my dates and I got to the payment window, Spirit Credit Mastercard offered a promotion of a {$100.00} instant credit to be applied to the reservation of my airfare in exchange for opening a credit card if approved. I was approved for the credit card through Bank of America. I received emails confirming my card and welcoming me stating that my card will be mailed to me along with no other contact information or account number other than "" Bank of America ''. I then proceeded to try to pay for my Spirit airfare reservation with my new credit card but the website required me to enter the new credit card account number/expiration/security code. I called Bank of America/Spirit Mastercard customer service and their response was they could only provide me an account number and expiration code, but no security code. Spirit 's website would not allow me to continue the purchase without inserting a security code, thus forfeiting my ability to pay with Spirit Mastercard and losing out on the {$100.00} credit. Bank of America 's customer service rep said I would have to wait for the physical card to arrive in order to purchase the airfare. By the time that would happen, the airfare would also cost me more!"

Why does n't it state what it does ... minimum payments will be applied to the 0 % offer balance and any amounts over will then be applied to the highest rate. I 'm disgusted and ca n't believe Bank of America allows this to happen. I 've been a loyal customer for 30 years and I ca n't imagine the total interest they have charged me over the years because of this."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a Bank of America credit card on XX/XX/21. After a lengthy verification process, I was initially given a verbal approval of a {$3000.00} credit limit. That later changed on XX/XX/21 to a {$1500.00} credit limit. After receiving my card, I began using it but I was careful not to charge it to the limit so it wouldnt negatively impact my credit report. I also made every payment on time ( actually ahead of time ) each month. However, on XX/XX/21 Bank of America suddenly decreased my credit limit to {$1100.00} without warning. Their action negatively impacted my credit report because it raised my credit utilization especially since at that time my bill was a little over {$900.00}. When I called to see why I wasnt notified prior to this action being taken, the representative said they mailed me a letter on XX/XX/21 ( the day before XXXX XXXX ). However, they never waited for me to receive the letter because they took action 3 days later. They never provided a turn-around time, waiting period and/or due process before changing my credit limit. Additionally, I later discovered that Bank of America was secretively and aggressively checking my credit report every month since I received my credit card prior to decreasing my credit limit. This action seem very illegal especially since I had already went through a credit check, had been approved and had already been using my credit cards for months. I feel discriminated against. This seems like XXXX XXXX"

Credit card or prepaid card,"During XX/XX/2021 California EDD placed my initial disibility payments on a debit card issued by Bank of America. 

I was not able to access the funds. I called Bank of America and was told that there was suspected fraud and California EDD placed a hold on the card. 

I contacted California EDD and ws told that my claim was approved and that Bank of America should release my funds. 

I am currently receiving disability checks fro California EDD. 

I have conveyed this to Bank of America on several occasions but they are still refusing to unlock my card and release my funds which they are continuing to make a profit from Please investigate."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Thursday the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX, I filed a claim # XXXX with the Bank of America Fraud Department in the amount of {$1300.00} that was taken from me through the Bank of America ATM machine. The theft was on various days starting on the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX through the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. So as I should, I reported it this to the Fraud Department as soon as possible. However, the service and the manner of action that was taken was not only unhelpful, but vague as well. So not knowing what to do, I called again on Friday the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX to request a hardship loan from the amount of what was taken from me ; but unfortunately, they informed me that I had to wait 10 days for the claim to be in pending status before anything can be done. And even though their policy is zero fraud liability, I waited the 10 days before my next call on Monday the XXXX of XXXX, only to be informed that my claim was denied with no explanation as to why. So with much effort, I was able to reopen the claim ; although, I am to wait another 10 days before any further action can be taken. So I am back at the beginning with them ; meanwhile my bills are adding up and I am left with nothing from what was taken from me because of the lack of service and security of Bank of America Fraud Department."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX XXXX  sent me an offer for 0 % interest rate for balance transfers. So I opened an account on the offer code sent to me via mail. I once account was open I used the balance transfer of {$10000.00} from my Bank America account to XXXX account. That was XX/XX/XXXX, that the balance transfer was confirmed by XXXX. Weeks go by Bank of America reflects no reduction of the transfer amount of {$10000.00}. I call XXXX and they stated they sent the funds to Bank of America. XXXX instructs me to call Bank of America as the issue is on their side. I call and Bank of America says no they did not receive the funds to call XXXX. Call XXXX back and told the funds are sent and will hit my Bank of America account in a day or two. I wait a week nothing. I called both banks several times including XX/XX/XXXX when Bank of America agent states they see the {$10000.00} funds disputed and unsure why and what. But then not shown in transactions. She was confused and sent me to the transfer department directly. Transfer department says no nothing there and no dispute to go to XXXX bank. Got nowhere with either bank then. Called again a day later and told by XXXX to verify the account I do so and mention it was several times. Person at XXXX says the issue is the wrong account info given. Total lie but ok as it was verified several times prior in phone calls to XXXX. I call on XX/XX/XXXX to both banks and get nowhere. I am told by XXXX here is the tracer number bank America can look it up and XXXX sees it and verify funds went to BOA. Tracer # XXXX. I was asked XXXX XXXX  for a confirmation of funds transferred and was told it will take 24-48 hours for that department to send me the record receipt of funds transferred. After asking twice for that confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX I got an email from XXXX that stated transfer was successful but dated XX/XX/XXXX. Having that tracer number and my customer ID XXXX. I call the banks both again and told by Bank of America they opened a dispute case on this and I would hear back regarding this situation. I have not and it is nearing a month now. I have been stuck in limbo since XX/XX/XXXX showing a credit card debit doubled what it is. My credit score fell XXXX points due to all this. I am in the process of purchasing a motorcycle and this has directly impacted me and me monetarily at this point. Neither bank will help and both tell me to go to the other bank."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/XXXX called Bank of America to assist me in filing a hardship as I am a victim of hurricane Michael. I am unable to work and have no income at the moment. I was on the phone for over an hour being transferred several times or not being helped. I was told only late fees could be waived and I could not get my payments postponed. They advertised online that they were helping customers with hardships and working to help in disaster relief, but stated over the phone that this was not true. I have emails that show to call BOA for assistance during this hard time and also online mortgages were allowed to be put on forbearance. No one sympathized with this horrible situation. 
Once I return to work, I will have several months due at one time which is unaffordable. I was requested to call back every month to state if i can not pay just to let them know. I was also told to call back WHEN I could pay. All my other creditors understood and did NOT falsely advertise. I had the right to request a hardship and I wasnt allowed and I am in a federal disaster area. My town is having to be rebuilt from the ground up. By not helping your customers in need you will drive our community into bankruptcy as an only option."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, the Employment Development Department ( EDD ) of California paid me unemployment insurance in the amount of {$12000.00} through the debit card administrated by the Bank of American. After I withdraw about {$8000.00}, the bank closed my debit card for identity reason. I completed verifying my identity through EDD by XX/XX/XXXX, but the bank continued to keep my account closed and refuse to release the $ XXXX fund to me. From XX/XX/XXXX to now, I called the bank many times but they always insisted that the fund is with EDD. The EDD says that once the fund was deposited into the debit card, it is controlled by the bank. I think what the EDD says is correct."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX notified me in XX/XX/2022 that Bank of America credit card was opened under my name. I checked XXXX and XXXX XXXX and verified that card was opened under my name even though balance was showing {$0.00} dollars with a credit limit {$15000.00}. I have a perfect credit history and score of XXXX. I have called and notified Bank of America right away to close the account ( fraud department ). XXXX on the phone ( XXXX XXXX stated that he was closing the account right away. It's outrageous they let someone open an account under my name without checking even though i have credit freeze in all credit reporting agencies. Its Bank of Americas negligence might affect my credit rating. They have never notified and or sent a letter to me in regard to cc opening. It appears to me that this gross negligence on behalf of Bank of America should be investigated to see how many other consumers might be affected. They have failed their due diligence steps verifying consumer account opening procedures and liable for any damages i might incur due to their incompetence. Besides closing that account, they should apologize to the consumer in writing who is affected and remove any trace of this cc opening along with offering free credit monitoring. Shame on this kind if shady practices routinely tolerated by Federal Government ( they need to be investigated and receive civil fines for violating my civil rights."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made an online payment using the Bank of America online portal. Prior to this, my phone was stolen on XX/XX/XXXX, which resulted in me needing to have my ACH information on my bank account changed after realizing I had multiple transactions I was not aware of. My bank told me all "" familiar '' charges ( IE : insurances, credit card payments, etc. ) would not be impacted. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email saying my payment failed. I attempted multiple times to log back into the app, but by the time I got the email it was outside of the XXXX minutes they provide you to log in for security purposes. After failing again today I called them, and was told that as of XXXX my account was cancelled due to non-payment ( have missed 2 payments EVER ). I did not receive any email until I called in ( I have phone records of this ). I spoke with a Senior Credit Analyst and they told me they would submit a request to reopen my account, NOT TELLING ME THEY'D DO A HARD INQUIRY ON MY CREDIT RESULTING IN A DING. For such a large financial institution, their business practices are disgusting and frankly I am wanting my account reinstated effective IMMEDIATELY. I made a {$1200.00} payment today that has gone towards the account.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a credit card with Bank of America # XXXX. 0n XX/XX/20 I get a cash advance for {$500.00} ; I was charged {$25.00} fee -- that was understood. On the same dayXX/XX/2020 I made a payment of {$500.00} assuming the payment will pay-off the {$500.00} cash advance, but the account activity with BOA did not enter the transactions in the order they occurred. The {$500.00} I paid was credited to the account on XX/XX/20 reducing my delayed balance of {$2000.00} that was interest free until XX/XX/20 to {$1500.00}. The {$500.00} cash advanced was entered into account activity 2 days later 0n XX/XX/20 thus the payment I made on XX/XX/20 did not go to pay it 0ff. By not crediting the account on XX/XX/XXXX for the cash advance, the {$500.00} was bearing interest from the day it was taken from the ATM machine with an interest charge {$9.00}. had Bank of America followed common accounting practices and entered the {$500.00} cash advanced, it would have being paid with the {$500.00} I made the same day and I would not be paying interest on the amount. Bank of America manipulate account entries to suit them. 

On XX/XX/20 I charged {$400.00} which I paid on XX/XX/20 under the 25 days grace period, offered by all credit cards and I was charged {$5.00} for that amount and got {$4.00}. This constitute fraud in cash back promises. 

Called Bank of America many times and the phone was hanged-off with the excuses they could not answer call right away."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/XXXX I call Bank of America- Merrill Lynch for information on my balance owed on my VISA Signature ( Merrill+ ) credit card. The automated service quotes me a current balance on my account : {$1800.00}. So I intended to make a phone payment of {$1800.00}. When I chose the option to make a payment, the automated service quotes me the amount of {$1900.00}. This amount was not current but based off the statement datedXX/XX/XXXXXXXXXX/XX/XXXX. I received a credit from a merchant : XXXX for {$42.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and another credit from them for {$7.00} on XX/XX/XXXX that was yet to be reflected in my statement for the following month. I was informed by Bank of America, I would receive a finance charge if I only paid the {$1800.00}, which would have brought my account to a {$0.00} balance. I had a {$0.00} balance on the previous statement. So, essentially, I would have to pay more than my current balance and have a credit of {$50.00} on my account to avoid a finance charge, even though that amount has already been credited on my account. If credits affect my current balance, then I should not be paying finance charges for bringing my balance to a {$0.00} balance. I was told by XXXX, a supervisor that Bank of America does not acknowledge credits to the account even if they are reflected in the current balance. Bank of America is misleading their customers by having their automated system state a customer 's current balance without a disclaimer stating that the full amount of the statement must be paid even if there has been a credit on the account. This racks up huge interest charges for Bank of America because the automated message regarding account balance potentially presents two different balances without explanation or instruction. What if I had bought a large item like a boat for {$5000.00} with my Visa, returned the boat due to faulty mechanism, the {$5000.00} credited to my Visa account within two days after the statement. Would I then need to pay {$5000.00} toward my now current balance of {$0.00} to avoid a 10.00 APR interest fee on my account? This is fraudulent and misleading. What right minded person would pay more than they owe when the balance is {$0.00}? Bank of America-Merrill Lynch is scooping up the millions in interest fees because they have mislead their customers to think they should make a payment based upon their current balance. Bank of America- Merrill Lynch is capitalizing on their automated services to keep customers from knowing what would keep them from paying unnecessary interest fees."

The Company did NOT send a response to me. And, I'm not calling them. They scare me and that's why I filed with CFPB. I need help.

Credit card or prepaid card,"This is the second time I have had to deal with this issue. I have a Visa Card issued by Bank of America ( BankAmericard ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased an Airline ticket from XXXX XXXX. I used the US site and the ticket was purchased in $ US for {$850.00}. On the same date, there was an unauthorized "" foreign transaction fee '' charged to my account of {$25.00} ( roughly 3 % ) even though there was no disclosure and the entire transaction was done in $ US. I am familiar that when you charge foreign currency that they apply a fee and I don't have a problem with that. When I alerted BofA on XX/XX/XXXX they immediately credited the fee back to me. More recently, on XX/XX/XXXX I again charged an airline ticket with XXXX to the same card. Once again the transaction was done in the US and on the US website, yet again I was charged an unauthorized "" foreign transaction fee '' of {$21.00}. I called Customer Service and was given an uncompromising stance that "" that's the way it is ''. I asked for a supervisor who, because of my long history with BofA, removed the charge. I believe this is a hidden fee grab by BofA that is neither legitimate nor disclosed when the transaction was performed. To be clear, I have no issue when the charge is in foreign currency, just when it is a straight dollar charge."

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2018, I received a text message about my Bank of America credit card alerting me that there had been 2 very large purchases made with my card, for over {$6000.00}. I called immediately to assure them that it was NOT me who made the purchases, and to file a fraud claim. they resolved the matter immediately, cancelled my card and reissued it with different numbers, of course. 

As i was paying my bill on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed another charge that I did not make, to XXXX. I called and was told that, yes, a charge for {$7.00} to XXXX and another charge of {$49.00} was posted to my NEW card. Again, I called and made a fraud charge, and was given the phone number to XXXX to contact them. When I spoke with the rep from XXXX, he told me that I had a subscription ... .I assured him I did NOT, and told him about the previous month '' s troubles. He asked if my email was XXXX ... IT IS NOT!!! At that point, he told me he would credit my account and send me a cancellation letter ( for an account I never opened!! ) The problem is that my new credit card number was used and I have NEVER used it! It sits in my desk drawer! HOW DID SOMEONE GAIN ACCESS TO THS NEW CARD WHEN IT IS IN MY DESK??? This must come from Bank o f America! 

The fraud case is settled and I am not responsible for the charges ... .but who, besides Bank of America has access to this card that was less than 1 month old??"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Filed claims XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/2022 with Bank of America credit card. Disputing charges due to service not being rendered as an immediate family member passed away unexpectedly. I received response to claim on XX/XX/2022 denying charges. They claim they must follow the policy of the company, XXXX XXXX. However, XXXX XXXX has a policy on their website that specifically states that bereavement is a valid reason to receive a refund of purchase. It is readily available on their website for anyone to view. 

I spoke with two staff members on XX/XX/XXXX, who were kind and empathetic and reopened the claims. They stated that death of an immediate family was an valid reason to dispute charges and said they would escalate the dispute. The last one gave me a fax number to submit the documents that show the death of the family member. I submitted the documents on XX/XX/2022 I called on XX/XX/2022 to see if they received the fax. The staff member did not see the fax attached to my account. Told me it takes a few days to link to accounts after it is submitted. 

Yesterday, XX/XX/2022, I received a second denial of charges, with the same reason. I called 3 times to speak with someone in the claims department. Eventually, after them repeating the same thing, I asked to speak with a supervisor. I received XXXX from Tennessee. She was rude, condescending, and did not show an ounce of empathy for the death of a loved one. I eventually became upset as I should since if death of a loved on is not hard enough, what constitutes a good reason to file a dispute? Isn't everyone filing a dispute because they did not receive the service or product and the company you purchased from is not handling the situation. This is appalling to think that death of an immediate family member is not a good enough reason. especially when you are faced with mounds of bills that you had not anticipated. 

I eventually went to XXXX, as I did not have time to sit on hold for 20-30 minutes, to ask what is a good reason to dispute a charge if death was not. The Bank of America help contacted me right away. I explained who I had spoken to and asked for someone other than XXXX from Tennessee. They immediately put me in touch with XXXX. Right off the bat, she was rude, did not listen to what I had to say that I knew the policy allowed for it and that I knew that the reason she was giving me was not valid. We have disputed the same charges in the past and they were granted. I knew right then, it was more important for her to be right, than to admit that she was wrong and show any empathy to a grieving family. 

The amount of stress and XXXX  this has caused on my family is outrageous. Not to mention the time that has been spent trying to make sure we do not have to pay a bill for a service we did not receive and immediately tried to take care of. 

I canceled the trip immediately on XX/XX/2022 when we found of of the passing. Long story short, she lived alone, and had been deceased for days before anyone found her. It was heartbreaking. In addition, the financial burden is devastating. There are loans in my sons name that we are now responsible for that we were unaware of. There is no life insurance or anything to assist with the additional debt. All of which I have made very clear. I was told at the time the cancelation was submitted along with the refund request, which was valid due to the death of a family member. I have not had good luck with the airline as I kept getting transferred around. I have not been in contact with them 5 times, and may be getting somewhere. 

I have the death certificate which I provided to Bank of America, along with proof of XXXX XXXX refund policy for death of an immediate family member. They still will not review the dispute and have treated me awful during most of the contacts. 

I would like someone else to contact me about the dispute and review the policies that are clearly on XXXX XXXX website."

Bank of America has continually used abusive, unprofessional and XXXX style tactics in their behavior with addressing this matter. In one of their only recent correspondence via a call with me they stated that a checking account from XXXX XXXX was used allegedly by myself to make payments as well set up this secured account They also stated if XXXX states that this checking account was a fraudulent account they would remove this from my credit bureaus. However, in their written correspondence they are now stating they would reexamine the matter. 
I have been in contact with XXXX and they have stated that I am not indebted to them from any accounts, therefore they will not provide any documentation for Bank of America. Also, that it is questionable, troubling and ridiculous that Bank of America would require another banking institution to provide such a letter to assist a consumer dealing with identity thief. 
Also, very important to note ; that Bank of Americas follow up statement to my original CFPB complaint, stated that XXXX confirmed that this above-mentioned checking account had my matching Social Security number. XXXX XXXX and Customer Advocate team stated and confirmed to me directly, per the companys policies and procedures they would never disclose sensitive private information about any consumer without a court order, to any third parties for liability reasons. Which means B of A completely and utterly fabricated lied about that entire encounter. ; troubling and disturbing. 
And most important, they B of A have stated ; they would be happy to remove the account if I pay them the monies owed ; regardless to fact, I have repeatedly stated Im an identity thief victim, which is blatant extortion ; again, extremely troubling and disturbing. 
Finally, Bank of America has continued to move the goal post, for me to effectively receive any kind of favorable outcome, also there are countless similar cases and situations ( hundreds of articles throughout XXXX, of questionable abusive tactics and practices involving getting monies from consumers ), where B of A has behaved in this manner."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Re : Claims Nos. XXXX & XXXX filed with BOA agains XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX- I notify BOA that services provided to me by XXXX XXXX  totaling {$400.00} should not be debited to my account due to poor service of my washing machine. With my claims I provide to BOA the following : 1 ) All receipts from BOA 2 ) Copy of my complaint against XXXX XXXX  with XXXX  of North Carolina - this complaint includes all details surrounding the service. 
3 ) Copy of my complaint to the State of North Carolina Department of Justice against XXXX XXXX  - this complaint includes all details surround the service. 
4 ) Copies of all receipts BOA 's subsequent letters I received in response to my claims in XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 letter ) XX/XX/XXXX ( 3 letters ) never once requested me to get a second opinion letter from another repair vendor evidencing the problems with the XXXX XXXX  repair ( "" 2nd Opinion Letter '' ). 

In a XX/XX/XXXX letter from BOA, about 3 months after I filed my claims, I get a request for the 2nd opinion letter! That is absolutely absurd - by that time I either would have ( i ) had the washing machine repaired or ( ii ) purchased a new washer. Who can survive 3 months without a washing machine? In my case I had purchased a new machine shortly after it was obvious that XXXX XXXX was not going to stand by their work Subsequently, a XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX letters from BOA have rejected my claims based on the fact I never provided a 2nd Opinion Letter. Both of these rejection letters have no name identified as a contact and no information about how to appeal them. They just have the customer support number - which I had already gotten nowhere with as outlined below. 

In response to the XX/XX/XXXX letter I called the claims area of BOA communicating to them that their request for a 2nd Opinion Letter should have been made in their initial XX/XX/XXXX letter! That I had in fact provided them with ALL information requested by them in their XX/XX/XXXX letter and 3 subsequent XX/XX/XXXX letter. 
I got no good response to my argument that 3 months after the claims are filed is much too late to request such information. I asked for a contact to appeal the rejection of my claim and I received an address in XXXX XXXX Texas but no specific department or person. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a letter to that address complaining about the mishandling of my XXXX XXXX claims and to date I have not received any response. 

If BOA had requested the 2nd Opinion Letter in their XX/XX/XXXX letter or their first letter sent in XX/XX/XXXX it would have be feasible for me to get such a letter. At anytime after that it is just ridiculous. A broken washing machine is just not something people can live with. 

BOA needs to change their process to insert the request in for the 2nd Opinion Letter in their initial letter to any consumer disputing a service. Additionally, they need to identify clearly any contact persons and/or phone number ( that is not the general customer support number ) in order to give the consumer the opportunity to get information about their claim or discuss their claim if rejected. Lastly, they should identify the process by which the consumer can formally dispute a claim rejection. 

It is really disheartening to find out that on top of a shoddy vendor getting paid {$400.00} for work they are not willing to stand by I have to deal with a credit card company that has a horrible claims process. 

I really want BOA to treat its customers professionally and equitably.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I use autopay to pay credit card bills. I had selected the option of paying full balance after noting that previously only minimum amount was selected to be paid. 

Despite that however, on XXXX XXXX, only minimum amount due was paid to my credit card. Both credit card and my bank account are with Bank of America. Later, an interest was charged to my account. 

I called them and explained that I had selected that full amount be charged from my account. They verified that that was the case. However, they said that such changes can take up to one month to take into effect. 

I countered that regardless, my intent has been and still is to pay in full balance. And so interest charged should be removed. I do not recall being informed that the changes take one month to take effect. 

Neither banking department or credit card department can resolve the issue and would refer me to the other department"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America advertised a promotional no-interest cash advance program when logging into my credit card account using the Bank of America App . The promotional program offered "" 0 % interest on a cash advance for 12 months ''. The promotional splash page clearly indicated that a 3 % charge on the cash advance amount would be incurred, which I was happy to pay, and that repayment of the cash advance amount would not be due for 12 months. I registered for the program online immediately for a {$2500.00} cash advance and was approved. I called Bank of America following issuance of my next statement to confirm that I could pay my balance less the cash advance amount and not incur interest charges. The BOA representative told me "" yes, you can short pay your statement by the {$2500.00} cash advance amount and not incur interest ''. I followed the BOA guidance, but was still charged interest on my subsequent statement and called Bank of America a second time to clarify. It was then explained that he only way to incur 0 % interest for 12 months was to stop making purchases on my credit card until the cash advance amount was paid off. Indeed, it was in the fine print, but nowhere in the program advertising, that all purchasing activity must cease in order to avoid interest charges on the cash advance amount. I filed a complaint with BOA as a deceitful advertising practice, and BOA still refused to refund me the 3 % program fee of {$75.00}, and now I'm in the position of paying back the cash advance in full immediately to avoid future interest charges. I feel the advertising of the program was highly deceitful and designed to misinform customers to the benefit of BOA."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a master card issued by the Bank of America, that I have been using over 15 years since XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout those many years, I never missed a payment each month while using the card. With a good performance in use and timely payments, the card 's total credit line was quickly increased to {$38000.00} and kept at that level until recently. 

It was just months ago in XX/XX/XXXX that, without an explanation, the Bank of America first time in 15 years reduced my card credit line to {$37000.00}. Then, suddenly last week, the Bank of America, again without any explanation ( not even a notice! ) cut down my credit line to one-seventh down to {$5700.00}. I was shocked to find such a drastic reduction. Furthermore, there was no reason that I could think of or provided by the Bank of America. 

I happened to find that sudden, shocking reduction of my credit line by the Bank of America when I logged on to its website on XX/XX/XXXX for online banking. Upon finding, I called the Bank of America and was told by its representative that the cutdown of my credit line was made as of XX/XX/XXXX. When I demanded a reason or explanation, he had no idea. After making a long pause with the phone line on hold, he came back and told me simply to call TransUnion. That was it. When I asked him whether a letter or notification was ever sent out to me about the matter, he initially said no, then changed to yes. But, later, he admitted that there was no letter or notification sent to me regarding the matter. To date, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received a letter or any form of communication by the Bank of America regarding its drastic cut-down of my card credit line. 

As suggested by the representative, I reviewed my latest credit report by TransUnion later but found no change, other than the Bank of America 's incorrect reporting on my mortgage payments made to it, which is listed as "" adverse account '' as the result. The Bank of America also made incorrect reporting on my monthly payments to its credit card. 

This is an unacceptable business practice and abuse of power by the Bank of America over small customers like me. Its unjustifiable, sudden, drastic cut-down of my card credit line has already caused some damages to me. It also negatively affects my credit scores by credit agencies, which will have negative ripple impacts over time. The Bank of America should be responsible for all the finanical damage and emotional distress it has caused with its unjustifiable, sudden, drastic reduction of my card credit line. 

I can provide any documents related to my statements above."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Today is XX/XX/2020. My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I recently worked for XXXX XXXX as a XXXX XXXX. I ordered a prepaid card from XXXX XXXX  to receive my weekly paychecks. I have had problems with the prepaid card. I had to register my online account twice. And had problems with viewing my account history. After calling the third time my online account access was granted. I accessed my online account and all deposit history wasn't displayed. I log off and logged back on a few hours later. And the information previously displayed before had updated and changed. I requested a hard copy or paper form to be delivered by mail two weeks previous to this incident. They failed to fulfill my request. I had to call again on XX/XX/2020 to request access to my online account and hard copy of my account history. 
Now that I have access to my online account. I have concerns about the information being altered and restricted. When I first gained access to my account online. I was only able to see a window that only showed XXXX transitions only. And only three deposits posted in the month of XXXX only. However, on the top of the screen, it asked me what dates I wanted to view. When I selected the dates I wished to view it only would allow me to view the month of XXXX only. I have concerns with the amount of the deposits, not being able to view my account transaction history in a timely manner, poor customer service, information being restricted and altered, etc. I wasn't paid all my money that this prepaid card has reported as being deposited in my account. I also noticed a deposit that was posted on XX/XX/XXXX My employed ended over a month ago and all of my earning should of been posted on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The prepaid card is through Bank Of America. On the back of this card, it has the wrong website to access online information or to register for an online account. On the back of the card it shows www.bankofamerica.com/moneynetwork. When I called customer service the agent over the phone informed me that it was not the right information. The right web address is the total opposite. The agent provided me with the proper address as being : moneynetwork.bankofamerica.com. So my question is why is the wrong information provided on the back of the card? Why has it been a delay for me to view my transtions? Why wasn't the right amount deposited into my account? Why is my online account restricting me from view my total account history including all deposit amounts? 
I called the card number today. I talked to an agent by the name of XXXX. I reported to her of the fact of me not being able to view my entire account history. She was unable to provide me with an answer. I asked her to go over with me over the phone of all my deposit history. What she sees is different from what I can see. I haven't received all the deposits reported. XXXX told me to contact XXXX XXXX. If this prepaid card is reporting receiving the deposit from XXXX XXXX. My problem isn't with XXXX XXXX, it's with money network.bankofamerica. It seems to me that both companies are working together to steal money from consumers. However, I need all the money that I worked for. I shouldn't have to go through extra measures to get something that's rightfully mine."

On XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX, {$2700.00} was stolen from my account at Bank of America ATMs. I discovered the theft on XX/XX/XXXX and reported it to Bank of America that day. Bank of America cancelled my old debit card and issued a new one. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America sent me a letter stating that my claim was closed "" because we believe the account or the claim have been the subject of fraud or suspicious activity. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I telephoned Bank of America. A supervisor told me that all Maryland unemployment insurance claims had been closed because of some sort of technical error, and that the claim would be reopened that day, XX/XX/XXXX. I was given a claim number different from the one in the closing letter. 

Since then I have received no communication from Bank of America. I have called and spoken with claim representatives and customer service agents on XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; and XX/XX/XXXX. No Bank of America employee has provided any useful information or told me the status of the investigation. They give me contradictory information about what the bank is doing and what I can expect. Many times they have told me that they can provide no information because "" the account is closed. '' My account has been frozen since at least XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America 's explanations for this are incomprehensible. 

The theft from my account was an unauthorized transfer, as Bank of America could easily confirm by comparing my driver 's license picture ( which I faxed to them twice ) with the photograph of the person making the unauthorized withdrawal. I provided timely notice of the error under Regulation E, section 1005.11 ( b ) ( 1 ). Bank of America did not investigate promptly or provide the results of the investigation, violating section 1005.11 ( c ). Bank of America has not given me a provisional credit pending investigation. More than 90 days have passed and Bank of America has provided no written explanation, violating section 1005.11 ( d ).

Credit card or prepaid card,"I would like to bring to the attention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the actions of Bank of America, my creditor institution with whom I hold a credit card. Their actions appear to have violated various stipulations of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) in multiple instances.

The actions of Bank of America that potentially violate the FCBA, include, but may not be limited to : 1. Claiming to not have received evidence pertaining to a transaction dispute when, in fact, such evidence had been received multiple times by Bank of America 2. Denying a requested chargeback despite having been provided numerous pages of evidence demonstrating an extended and repeated effort to return unwanted duplicate merchandise, and despite the fact that the merchant had provided no documents or evidence in any form pertaining to this matter 3. Failing to provide, despite repeated requests, the evidence considered when determining the outcome of the disputed transaction Please find below a chronological account of the matter : On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to purchase a XXXX XXXX. an online vendor. I was charged for two laptops, and immediately attempted to contact Merchant cancel the duplicate order. Unsuccessful, I continued to repeatedly contact the Merchant and requested a cancellation over the course of two weeks until and after it was shipped on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. These attempts were documented and collated, altogether constituting dozens of pages, which shall be referred to as Buyers Evidence. In light of Merchants conduct, I disputed the transaction of {$460.00} using Bank of Americas online banking portal. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America adjusted the disputed transaction so that it on longer appeared on my balance as a credit charge. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a request for evidence from Bank of America regarding this case. I thus attempted to provide Buyers Evidence using the Bank of America online banking portal. However, a technical error occurred that rendered it undeliverable. That same day, I emailed Buyers Evidence to XXXX, an email address for Bank of America that I have been told is operational by Bank of America representatives. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America to report the technical problem that had occurred when sending Buyers Evidence. They advised me to visit my local Bank of America branch, which is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, IL, to submit Buyers Evidence. That same day, I did so. For the second time, I also emailed Buyers Evidence to XXXX. The only response from Bank of America was an adjustment to the disputed transaction so that it again appeared on my balance as a credit charge. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America closed the dispute in favor of the Merchant. That same day, I called Bank of America. A representative informed me that they had received three pages of evidence from myself. Note that, at that point in time, I had emailed Buyers Evidence, which consisted of at least 18 pages of evidence, to Bank of America on two separate occasions, and delivered Buyers Evidence in person to a Bank of America branch on one occasion. During that same call, a representative told me that my dispute had been reopened, and that the case number was XXXX. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America regarding the dispute. They informed me that my dispute had not been reopened, and said that the number XXXX referred to something else, which was not made clear to me. They also claimed that Bank of America had not received Buyers Evidence from me the day prior, and advised that I return my local Bank of America branch to again submit Buyers Evidence. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message on my Bank of America online banking portal stating that my attempt to dispute the transaction was declined. That same day, I called Bank of America and requested that they send all evidence that they had considered in determining the outcome of this dispute, which I will call Merchants Evidence, as guaranteed to me under the FCBA. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America and informed the representative that I had not received Merchants Evidence despite my prior request, and then placed a second request for Merchants Evidence to be mailed to my home. I also requested that a complaint be filed regarding this matter, noting that a potential FCBA violation could have been committed. The representative stated that they would file a complaint. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America and inquired as to the status of my complaint. The representative stated that, even in cases where the customer believes their rights are being violated, Bank of America as a policy does not respond to customer complaints. I then specified to the representative the dates on which I had requested Merchants Evidence, and that I had still not received Merchants Evidence. I also requested that Merchants Evidence be faxed to my local Bank of America branch so that I could receive Merchants Evidence in person. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I visited the Bank of America branch and received three pages of documents from MsXXXX XXXX , an apparent manager of the branch. Two of these pages were Fax Cover Sheets, and one page was a letter of one sentence in length that read, Weve enclosed a copy of the documentation you requested on the account listed above. The absence of any additional documentation seemed to indicate that Bank of America had received no evidence from Merchant. I informed Ms. XXXX that she was legally required to give me all documents pertaining to this matter. She responded that those were the only three documents she had.

In the attached screenshot from the information Bank of America submitted, the underlined text shows the information that Bank of America has fabricated. This is not the first time they did this.

It was all a lie and they were not. When I got there I peeked in the small lobby to see a large number of people not wearing masks including the facilities manager and her employee behind the desk. On the front of the registration desk was a large sign about three feet long that said, "" No masks, no service ''. But about 60 % of the people in the lobby were not wearing masks AND the employees were not wearing masks so I did not enter. I came back later when the lobby had cleared out. I asked the employees why they were not wearing masks, they did not answer. I asked for my money back as I had provided a credit card when reserving the room. They said if I did not cancel the reservation more than 24 hours before that they could not refund my money. So I was stuck. In a town with 100 's of motel rooms there was no alternative as everything is always full. I couldn't sleep on the beach or in my car as I'd get a citation. So I used the merchants services and stayed in the motel the night, and then got the heck out of their at XXXX the next morning. Bank of America of course follows their antiquated rules and simply state that as I stayed at the motel therefore I can not successfully contest the charge. I would hope during a world wide pandemic people would understand that not only was the motel "" not as described '' but they put me in a life threatening situation.

Credit card or prepaid card,"During the financial crisis of 2008 to protect our small business a cash withdrawal was made against my Bank of America Master Card. Since then payments have continuously been made. Bank of America explained that the payments are not made to the higher interest cash loan.

I have repeatedly contacted Bank of America to reduce the interest rate. They continue to decline my requests even though the balance of the past due amount has been paid off and the payments higher than the minimum due have been paid. Bank of America for years advised me that they review the accounts to reduce interest rates if there are no late payments and a substantial monthly payment has been made, all of which has been accomplished. 

My complaint is to have my interest rate reduced and any credits applied to my account if it is deemed that Bank of America has acted unfairly and has taken advantage of consumers during the financial crisis of 2008."

My credit score has not gotten back to the previous levels yet."

On XX/XX/XXXX I called them back because I did not receive a letter in the mail after 5 business days so I thought the credit card request did not go through therefore I called back and instead of looking at my history and telling me there was a letter on its way they had me apply for another credit card that was not possible at the time for me to receive again bad on their customer service and really negative to helping someone at the age of XXXX get their first credit card. after several business days I received letters in the mail stating I have no credit score yet therefore I can not receive these cards. On XX/XX/2018 I applied for a student card with Bank of America after calling in frustration why the cards they recommended me for did not get approved they then recommended I apply for a student card but since my credit was negatively effected from their recommendations for my first 2 applications I was not accepted for that card either. VERY FRUSTRATING being only XXXX and trying to start a positive credit line. I then finally gave up on Bank of Americas poor customer service and recommendations and got a XXXX   XXXX journey card which I was immediately approved for. I would like to fix these hard inquiries and have them taken off my credit score on XXXXXXXX XXXX, and XXXX 

Thank you for your time and I hope that this can be fixed."

The credit card was recently paid down to a balance of {$0.00}, so when this payment went through, my credit card balance was - {$2000.00}. Upon noticing, I immediately contacted BoA and attempted a stop payment on XX/XX/XXXX. They were unable to perform this action and the payment cleared on XXXX XXXX. I have been on the phone with them every day since and got a request approved to expedite the refund on Friday XX/XX/XXXX.

Yesterday, upon checking my account and finding the money had not been refunded, I again called the XXXX services dept of the BoA Credit card division and spoke with the same supervisor who approved the expedited refund last Friday. She informed me that the refund would be processed last night and hit my account this morning. They assured me of this. 

Today, I checked my account, and there was still no XXXXXXXX credit to my checking account. At this point I am completely livid. A simple mistake of pressing the wrong button in Bank of America 's banking app has resulted in hours of wasted effort on my part and the headache of having a balance of XXXX in my checking account for what will be at least 2 weeks. Additionally, my only form of money right now, my credit card, is constantly being locked due to "" suspected fraudulent activity '' and restricting me from making any kinds of purchases.

Due to the holidays & covid and the time it was taking to receive mail especially at a XXXX XXXX XXXX did not actually receive it until sometime after XXXX But on XX/XX/XXXX I had respond back to XXXX that I had received the wig but was not satisfied with purchase & wanted to return it. Got several responses back from XXXX telling me not to send back was advised not return because postage is high & risk is unpredictable. Was told to take wig & have it styled & i said with covid could not be done nor did i want to put any more expense into something i was not at all satisfied with. On XX/XX/XXXX they said they would refund me 13 % & that i could keep the wig or sell it. The wig it cost me {$66.00} & any refund less than that amount was not acceptable to me especially after going on their website & reading their refund/return policy says nothing about a percentage of refund. Told them that they were fraudently trying to keep more money than they should be. So I went back and forth with them and the last amount they offered was {$25.00} dollars & to return wig but at this point it does sound like shipping back is unpredictable because they even state this in their website. These companies & their practices are just outrageous have not encountered such practices until now & beside this company Bank of America does not dispute any transaction for the customer they only deal with fraud and they don't even deal with the fraud well as all of world has been able to see. What bank does not back up any transaction made with a card they belongs to them that should be illegal in itself especially when it is a goverment agency they are handling it for.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Unfortunately, I was a victim of fraud and identity theft and although I bank with Bank of America and have a Bank of America credit card, they were unable to provide me any assistance with the matter. 

For background, I am a mystery shopper working for a company called XXXX. I was a victim of fraud when someone posing as the mystery shopping company asked me to purchase 3 XXXX gift cards of a value of {$500.00} and have me send them the gift cards and rate my shopping experience as part of my duties. 

At first they made an {$1800.00} payment to my card which should have covered the gift cards and my reimbursement for the survey and experience report but that payment was canceled. Shortly therefore after, a payment of {$1500.00} was made to cover my expenses but that was canceled as well. I am now not only being charged for the gift cards which were part of the fraud but also for the two cancellation fees and late fees that incurred on my card. 

My bank has refused to do anything about the case even though I was a victim of identity theft and fell victim of a scam/fraud in which they stole the identity of the company I work for. Their website clearly states that they have a {$0.00} liability guarantee as long as fraud is reported promptly, which it was, yet they are telling me I am not covered. They need to resolve this matter immediately."

I hope you will report this to Credit Bureau and I told Bank Of America that I want this indivisible prosecuted to the fullest extent, thank you for your time."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I submitted a fraud claim on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX for fraudulent transactions totaling XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX there was a {$1000.00} atm withdrawal from XXXX CA and XX/XX/XXXX there was another for XXXX. At the time of the transactions I was in the hospital one day and when I went to go pick up medicine and pay for it my edd Bank of America card was not working. I checked and saw the fraudulent transactions and immediately called BOA to file a fraud claim. Everything went smoothly. I was granted the temporary credit and once the investigation was concluded I received a letter in the mail stating I could keep the temporary credit indefinitely. On XX/XX/XXXX however, BOA debited that amount back to them, {$1400.00}, and after spending hours and hours on hold ( totaling over 15 hrs on hold ) I finally had an escalation submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. I came across unprofessional and unhelpful boa agents who did not know what they were doing and giving me inaccurate information. That same day I sent a fax to a number given to me by an agent and they said that department would contact me back to see if they received my fax. They did not. She said to send a fax with a letter explaining my situation and with proof that it was not me who committed the fraud withdrawal. Luckily in my case I did have proof. I had hospital discharge papers. I sent those to that fax number and they had private health information along with personal demographics. Since they did not contact me at all I was worried about who I sent these papers to and this is a HIPPA violation of some random person received this fax and not BOA. Since XX/XX/XXXX I did not hear back from bank of America until recently in XXXX they started sending me letters. One letter said they froze my card because of fraud ( this was the new card I had received and I never reported fraud through this card ) and I had NO problems with EDD ( my identity was verified ) and I kept receiving my benefits without a problem so this was not an EDD Issue. I received another letter ( BOTH had no dates on them ) saying they unfroze my card, which was weird because I had not called them asking why my new card was frozen this occurred in XXXX. Since the letters were not dated I was not sure when they were sent out. I then receive another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that BOA has not heard from me about my claim since they debited back that amount and that I had until the XXXX to contact them with more information. I call as soon as I read it and ask to speak to a supervisor. Last time I asked to speak to a supervisor the agent told me she did not have one ( very false ). This time when I asked the agent transferred me to customer service and then I had to wait again to be transferred back to the fraud department and explain myself yet again to another agent. This agent finally transferred me to her supervisor and the supervisor was also no help but she did make me worry even more about my problem. She did tell me that she was able to see all the calls Ive made since XXXX and the notes and that my claim was still open and an escalation was made XX/XX/XXXX. She told me she did not see this letter being sent out from her side or the back office which was the dispute solutions department. I told her how is that possible when Im holding the letter in my hands. She then tells me to fax a letter explaining my situation and I told her I already did all that and now that shes telling me to fax again I asked that this is concerning because I might had a HIPPA violation due to me sending my hospital discharge papers to this fax number on XX/XX/XXXX that I was given to by a BOA agent. She then begins to read the letter I sent and that the dispute department did in fact receive it. So then I ask, how am I receiving this letter from the dispute solutions department saying that they havent heard from me since they took my money but that she just confirmed that they did in fact receive it in XXXX. She stated again and again that she just doesnt see that letter from her end but that shes not saying she doesnt believe me and thats all she kept saying. She was no help and I feel helpless at that fact that I cant get my unemployment money back. I am 8 months pregnant and been so stressed out because of this and has caused emotional damage at this point. They STOLE MY MONEY AND REFUSE TO GIVE IT BACK. I asked why cant they do what they did with the first investigation where they concluded I was not at fault, why not check the atm cameras, why arent my discharge papers enough proof. She did not give me an answer. I had to go months without my EDD benefits because every time I got them they were being credited towards that negative balance I had XXXX. Bank of America forced me to use all my savings because of this. I need help please. Bank of America refuses to attend to my claim. Its not my fault that it is so easy to hack their prepaid card system and that they dont invest enough in our security. Please look into this complaint immediately. Im getting more stressed out as my due date approaches."

The second one said she'll reopen the case and she said she will add heavy notes but the problem is that since this fiasco started that's all they tell me and nothing really happens. Im waiting for her to reopen the case but it seems like she ran away too.

The representative told me that charges take up to 90 days to resolve and that I would receive credit for fraudulent charges in the meantime. They also said that they couldnt do any investigating until charges had been posted. With the representative, we reviewed all 4 charges, and I made sure that the ones investigated were the correct, fraudulent ones. That night, temporary credits for SOME of the fraudulent charges showed up on my credit card statement ( the two XXXX XXXX XXXX  amounts, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX one ). 

On Friday XXXX, a refund from the XXXX charge comes through from the company associated with ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, not BofA ). That same day, the credits I received that Tuesday were revoked. BofA charged my credit card account again for the total sum of all the credit they had previously given me for the fraudulent claims. This was correct for XXXX XXXX XXXX as that company had refunded me, but absolutely incorrect for the XXXX XXXX XXXX  charges as they had not been resolved at all. I received a letter that day from BofA claiming that my disputes had all been closed and would receive no further review. 

I was infuriated ( still am ). On Saturday XXXX, I call again. After being on hold for almost an hour, a service representative comes on to tell me that the fraud claims office was closed for the weekend, but that one of the fraudulent charges I was disputing ( XXXX XXXX ) had never been flagged on their end as fraud. This was incredibly frustrating, as I had confirmed multiple times in each of my calls which charges were fraudulent including the XXXX XXXX one. I asked the representative to, once again, open a dispute on that charge on top of the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ones. Additionally, I asked if there was anything I could provide or do to help prove that these charges were indeed fraudulent the BofA representative assured me that their team would handle the matter. 

The next Tuesday ( XXXX ), I called again. This time, the representative told me that there was no documentation from their fraud claims investigation team whatsoever, and that she had no idea why they'd dismissed my charges. She assured me that she would reopen the disputes. When I asked for temporary credit to cover all three of the outstanding fraudulent charges ( the two XXXX XXXX ones and the Heavenly one ), she said that they might take a few weeks to come through, but that I'd receive them. 

I only ever received temporary credit from BofA for the amount in the Heavenly charge I never got the credits for the two XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  charges. Nonetheless, I waited. 

Today, over a month after I first tried to decline these fraudulent charges, that credit for the Heavenly amount was once again revoked. I expect to receive a similar letter soon declaring that my disputes have been closed. Bank of America is purposefully dodging my fraudulent charge disputes, and is refusing to uphold their customer service promise of fraud protection. 

These charges are clearly fraudulent. The day they came through, I had been at work in North Carolina. Additionally, I had genuine charges ( spending activity ) in North Carolina both the Sunday beforehand and the very next day ( using my debit card, as my credit card had been deactivated and I would need to wait for a new one ). I also had NO history of spending that matched the pattern of activity the fraudulent spending followed ( hundreds of dollars at a mini mart?! ). This entire matter is extremely taxing on me, both monetarily and emotionally. Additionally, the accumulated pending charges are damaging my credit score, which could have long-term impacts completely out of my control. 

In total, the unresolved sum for all the fraudulent charges that BofA has refused to return to me is XXXX. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX : {$360.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$320.00} XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX  : {$340.00}"

I dont know why she said I am not qualifying, and another three staffs work for BOA all said I am qualified to get the rewards after they review. If I am not qualifying why the three staffs all let me wait the rewards in? The fourth guy said that is the old program so the staff does not know. Also, I dont know why the staffs work at customer service wouldnt get the training from their company? The bank never let me know which is the qualify for cash rewards.

Credit card or prepaid card,In XX/XX/XXXX my Bank of America XXXX card was hacked and XXXX was transferred to someone elses account. This has happened before and after 4 different times for much lower amounts. Each time I got a new card. Reset passwords and security questions and BOFA returned lost money but the claim for XXXX was denied by BOFA and no reason was given. I was told by a claims rep that they had changed systems and submitted a new claim that was denied because the first claim was denied. BOFA submitted a claim denial review on XX/XX/XXXX.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, {$11000.00} worth of fraudulent charges were processed on my Bank of America credit card account across 8 separate transactions. This card had no legitimate spending on it since XXXX and was completely paid off with a XXXX  balance on XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified of the unusual spending by a third party financial app ( the XXXX XXXX  by XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, as opposed to Bank of America itself, which I feel was a real oversight on their part given the unusual spending pattern ( any other bank would have put a stop on the card! ). Nevertheless, I immediately contacted Bank of America to report this as fraud and they subsequently provided a temporary refund for the charges on XXXX while they completed their investigation. According to Bank of America, in between the time period of when I paid off the balance of the card in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America had allegedly sent a new card to me as the old one expired. However, I never received this card in the mail or activated it. It was determined that the card must have been stolen and somehow activated by the same individual who fraudulently made these charges. At the same time, I realized several new credit cards were opened in my name around the same XX/XX/XXXX time period ( I was getting credit card notifications in the mail from various companies ). In total, 7 new accounts were opened in my name with various charges. It became clear I was a victim of identify theft and I immediately contacted each credit card/financial institution to file claims. With the assistance of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a service through MasterCard services XXXX XXXX ) I also froze my credit with all three credit reporting agencies, place a fraud alert, and filed a report with the FTC on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America sent a letter notifying they had completed their investigation and resolved the dispute in my favor and all charges, plus interest, would be credited to my account. On the same day, I received a second letter notifying me the claim was actually denied and Bank of America subsequently placed all charges back onto my account. Once receiving these conflicting messages from Bank of America, I filed a second dispute to reopen the investigation given the conflicting letters and the charges being placed back on my account. After 5 months, with interest and late payment fees accruing the entire time, on XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America denied my claim a second time. 

All other financial institutions where fraudulent charges and accounts were opened in my name determined that these transactions were not me and resolved the claims in my favor. Bank of America continues to deny the claim without providing sufficient proof that it was me who made these charges. I am running out of options in terms of resolving this dispute with Bank of America and can not afford ( and should not be liable ) to pay the {$11000.00} in fraudulent charges. Thanks to late fees and interest over the course of their 5 month long investigation, the total balance has grown to {$11000.00}. I have done everything I was supposed to as a consumer in terms of notifying the crediting agencies and filing a report with the FTC noting this was fraudulent activity. I have a stellar credit history, which is now being put in jeopardy as a result of Bank of America 's gross negligence. The financial hardship is even more pressing given the current stresses of the current COVID-19 pandemic. It has been a hassle to even speak with a helpful representative at Bank of America throughout this whole process. As a loyal customer for over 4 years, I feel deeply betrayed and misguided."
Credit card or prepaid card,I 've opened a credit card with XXXX about a year and four months.. I had 0 % interest for the whole duration of about a year and four months.. I used my credit card at about 50-80 % limit because I was investing in my education.. and used credit as an advantage and have payed it off before interest has took effect ... I tried to apply for a credit card at Bank of America and it seems my credit score went down due to using my credit limit at a high rate ... I would like to be able to talk about this since I was responsible for paying off in full without the APR taking in effect.

I contacted Bank of America. They offer fraud protection with this card. Bank of America prematurely closed the case. Denying me. 
I contacted the bank two more time. The agreed that it was their error and that they would reopen the case. Each time they reopen the case they closed it less than 24 hrs later. Zero chance for me to give no info."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I submitted a dispute verbally on XX/XX/2023. The CSR said he would expedite the claim. 
I called Bank of America again on XX/XX/2023 and spoke with a male in the fraud department. 

He said it takes up to 45 days for an analyst to check on my dispute. 

This is unacceptable and I never got a written notice about the fraud department 's timeline. 

Therefore, I believe they are purposely dragging their feet, which is unethical ( maybe not illegal, but I will check that ). 

I will have counsel look more into this matter for possible legal action."

Now I can't even get my Maryland Unemployment benefits which the state of Maryland has issued to me but Bank of America refuses to put into my account and I need this money to live.

Credit card or prepaid card,Bank of America has several options for setting up autopay for your credit card. I selected to have the amount due paid each month 5 days before it was due. After several months I noticed I was being charged interest. Upon further research I discovered that amount due is actually the same as minimum amount due which is another option they provide. This is incredibly misleading and irresponsible by Bank of America. My research online revealed that many people have had this happen to them.

I have never check my balance or withdrawn money in XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2020 ; I checked my Bank of America account on the Mobile phone APP and noticed all these transactions I did not approve. I called the fraudulent number with Bank of America to notify them I did not approve those 3 transactions. The representative files a fraudulent claim and reissued me a new prepaid debt card. The rep. told me it will take at least 25-40 days before I will get my money returned and I will receive a letter in the mail about my claim and an email confirmation.

I waited. On XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter that was dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my claim was denied in full. They will no longer consider covering the fraud they acknowledged occurred.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a Bank of America Merrill Plus Visa Credit Card for years until XX/XX/2019, when this card was suddenly closed by Bank of America without my authorization or even my awareness at all. When this card was closed, I still had XXXX reward points available in my credit card account. Before my card was closed, I never received any prior notification from Bank of American that my card will be closed. Even when the card was closed by Bank of America , Bank of America never notified me this card closure either. 

Two weeks ago, when I was to trying to log into my online account, I found that my card was already closed by Bank of America. Then I called BOA credit card customer service and was told that my card was already closed by BOA in XXXX. However, I didn't even get chance to use my XXXX rewards points before the card was closed. Although in the end of this call, BOA customer service representative let me redeem my reward points for XXXX and XXXX gift cards. However, redeeming points for gift cards made me lose significant value of the points, because the points worth much higher value if I redeem them for air ticket reservations. But unfortunately, BOA customer service representative told me that I can not reactivate this closed credit card and I can not redeem the points for air tickets either. The only redemption option that she offered me was to redeem points for gift cards, which made me lose about 50 % of the point value. 

Since Bank of America closed my credit card without my pre-authorization or even any prior notification, I didn't get any chance to redeem my XXXX rewards points for more valuable air tickets. I must request Bank of America to compensate me at least {$300.00} for the lost value of my reward points. I lost about {$530.00} value for my XXXX rewards points because the air ticket if redeemed can worth XXXX cents/point but the redeemed gift card only worth XXXX cent/point. Now I only request BOA to compensate me {$300.00}, which I believe is a very fair and reasonable resolution. 

Again, I request Bank of America to compensate me {$300.00} for my lost rewards point value and mail the {$300.00} check to my address."

Credit card or prepaid card,"on XX/XX/2018 Merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX College charged me {$60.00}. This is a billing dispute as this amount was paid in cash. The transaction was initially processed via credit card in person up until the point the chip reader was malfunctioning. The representative stated I could pay in cash since the payment processor was not functioning normally. At this point I agreed to cancel the electronic payment and proceed to pay in cash. As I left the college, I found out I was charged on my statement. I did not authorize this charge and am not responsible for the amount on my billing statement. Witness XXXX XXXX. Claim was denied."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019, I bought a tank of gas from a gas station in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX with an XX/XX/XXXXXXXX credit card underwritten by Bank of America. I understood the correct charge to be USD XXXX but my credit card was charged USD XXXX, 100 times the correct charge for a tank of gas. I reported the fraudulent charge to Bank of America. They delayed processing my fraud claim, switching the claim to a billing dispute months after I had reported the fraud, and then proceeded to rescind the charge and reapply the charge multiple times. I have spent hours on the phone and spoken to 11+ fraud and billing dispute representatives to no avail. I have refused to pay this fraudulent charge and so of course my credit score has been decimated, going from excellent to poor. I need assistance."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have an XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card through Bank of America. I am able to access card information through an online service through Bank of America. I have activated a "" minimum payment option '' which indicated that my amount due was {$210.00} to be taken directly out of my bank account. I have confirmed with Bank of America that the minimum   pay option was marked on my online account. 

Bank of America took {$10000.00} in addition to the {$210.00} on XX/XX/2019. This was unauthorized, and represents an illegal action by Bank of America. Please prosecute them for theft, as they now have confirmed to me that they will not be returning these funds. This was especially vexing as the funds in my account were to pay Federal and State taxes."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Someone counterfeited my Bank of America EDD Debit card. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to use this debit card to withdraw {$1000.00} from the ATM at the Bank of America ATM on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX CA. The ATM denied the withdrawal saying I had reached my maximum withdrawal for the day, however, I never went to the bank that day. I called the Bank of America customer service number on the back of my card and they said there were ten {$1000.00} withdrawals, one a day, for the past 10 days. As soon as I realized my money was being stolen on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America Prepaid Claims to cancel that debit card and send me a new card. I have not used the new card and I cut up the old card. 

I filed a fraud claim with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. I included the following transactions. 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX 24 minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal 30 seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal Then Bank of America rejected my claim because they said I made the withdrawal at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. After looking into it, I realized the agent and myself made a mistake by including two transactions that I had actually made. I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX and I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked Bank of America to remove the two withdrawals I made on those dates and to send in a reconsideration of the claim with those two withdrawal transactions removed. Bank of America said the removal of the two transactions were approved and removed from the claim, however, Bank of America still kept denying the claim. 

The following transactions are definitely fraud and I have been trying to dispute them for since XX/XX/XXXX to get the {$8000.00} from me that was stolen : XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal XXXX seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX  $ XXXX withdrawal There were eight total {$1000.00} withdrawals that I did not do which are fraud. 

On XXXX XXXX I filed a police report with the City of XXXX. The police report number is : XXXX and the officer is XXXX # XXXX. Currently, Detective XXXX of the XXXX Police Department is working on my case to press criminal charges against the person who committed fraud against me. When I spoke to Detective XXXX yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX, She informed me that she spoke with Bank of America and they told her the footage is now deleted as it expires after 120 days. However, I believe Bank of America is lying that they no longer have the footage because they mailed me a still capture image of myself at the ATM from XX/XX/XXXX and they mailed that to me on XX/XX/XXXX, which is way past 120 days. Now Bank of America is lying to the police. 

I feel like Bank of America has been pushing me around in a circle and now the footage that proves my innocence to get my money back is "" erased '', according to Bank of America. 

I request the {$8000.00} stolen from me is returned. I have filed numerous complaints to Bank of America against agents who misled me during the claim process and against agents who said they did something that they did not actually do. I.E. removing the two transactions that were me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX a supervisor who said their team working on my claim will review all the footage. That never happened. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the claim was denied again because XXXX, a supervisor in Kansas said they were only looking at the two videos of me, and they had not looked at any additional footage from the other dates that I was disputing since the first video showed me at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. She said she requested for the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX to be removed. She also said the withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX was removed from the claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, a Bank of America agent from Georgia. She said she did a withdrawal to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction and sent in a request to escalate it. This was contradictory to what XXXX told me, because she said the XX/XX/XXXX transaction was already removed, but this other agent said it was not. XXXX said she also did not see a letter generated to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction, so she submitted a request to remove that transaction from the claim. She also filed three complaints against agents who did not properly file the removal of transactions and she claims that she escalated those complaints. My claim was still getting denied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX in Alabama. She submitted a reconsideration request of my claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX in Nevada. I told her that in the mail, I received still captures of two transactions that I did. One on XX/XX/XXXX ( which was not included in the claim ) and one from XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why Bank of America won't send me the footage/still captures of the other eight ATM withdrawals that I know were not me. She said since Bank of America identified me in the transaction from XX/XX/XXXX, they didn't look at anymore footage, they just denied the whole claim. She also confirmed that the two transactions on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were finally removed and excluded from the claim. However, If this was truly the case, I don't know why the claim would still get denied when the other 8 transactions will not show me because I was never at the bank in the wee hours of the morning when those 8 transactions took place. XXXX also submitted a request to have the images of the other 8 transactions mailed to me. I was waiting over two weeks for these images but I never received anything in the mail. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to supervisor XXXX in Texas. He submitted another reconsideration request and he recommended I write another letter to Bank of America explaining the situation. I submitted another detailed letter to them via fax and still have heard nothing back. According to Agent XXXX, there are still attempted transactions being made on the old card even up to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the OCC and State Banking Regulator of CA. They recommended I file a complaint here. 

Bank of America, to my knowledge, never reviewed all the tapes of the transactions that were in this claim. 

Overall, the patterns of these fraudulent transactions do not align with my behaviors using the debit card and I know the footage of the eight withdrawals I am contesting will show the person making those withdrawals, I solemnly swear is not me, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have also been a loyal Bank of America customer for personal checking accounts since XXXX and my current business accounts are also with Bank of America since XXXX."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Summary of Complaint : Bank of America did not perform a thorough investigation ; Bank of America purposefully waited to inform me of the investigation results in order to allow the time window for disputing to close ; Bank of America did not inform me, even when asked, of any arbitration or escalation process. 

On XX/XX/2018, my credit card was charged {$560.00} for a deposit from a moving company I hired for a cross-country move. The company took all my belongings on XX/XX/2018. I realized in XXXX that the moving company was fraudulent and had no intention of delivering my things and had become unresponsive, so I initiated a dispute with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2018. I discovered that the company, "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' had their DOT license revoked on XX/XX/2018, before they came to my house ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), and later discovered that they were indicted as part of a multi-state, multi-company federal racketeering scam ( https : //www.justice.govXXXX ). I also have a police report on file where the theft took place. 

Bank of America didn't uncover any of this evidence during their investigation. They have a single fax, dated XX/XX/2018, that shows the bill of lading that I signed along with a note from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' claiming that *I'm* the one trying to commit fraud. I was not given an opportunity to respond to this. The note has an address from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Florida ( corresponds to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX '' as well as "" Moving XXXX  XXXX, XXXX '' ) and I was told that the account holder was from "" XXXX XXXX  XXXX ''. I called Bank of America to find out more information, in the hopes that I'd find where my things might be, but they said they didn't get any individual contact names, proof that my items were ever delivered ( just stolen ), or information about where my things are. 

Bank of America used this as proof that the company did their job by taking all of my family 's possessions, and closed the case ; however, they didn't notify me right away, but rather waited until XX/XX/2018 to draft the response ( postmarked XX/XX/2018, and received XX/XX/XXXX ). I called them to dispute this, but they kept telling me that there was nothing they could do, even though I asked to reopen the case. When I called them just now one last time ( on XX/XX/2018 ), they told me that the allowed time to dispute a case had expired, that there was no possible way to reopen the case, and that there was no escalation path or anyone at Bank of America with the authority to put the money back into my account. 

There was also a check that the fraudulent company cashed in XXXX County, Maryland. That check isn't part of this dispute, but the endorsement on the back says, "" XXXX XXXXl XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. This shows a pattern of fraud, as "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX '' is registered in Florida with no such DBA, and is not registered in Maryland ( where XXXX XXXX XXXX is registered ). 

This feels like I've been scammed both by the fraudulent moving company as well as by my Bank, and I believe they purposefully waited to inform me so that I couldn't re-open the investigation. I'm also shocked that there is no arbitration process available with the credit card."
Credit card or prepaid card,"There are already multiple complaints that Bank of America ignored. Their regulatory complaint staff refuse to return phone calls. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I got scammed and thought I was speaking to Bank of America corporate. Unfortunately, it was a criminal enterprise unknown to me when I was trying to verify my information with the crook to get help. As the fraud was happening, I contacted Bank of America right when the fraud was occurring ( the thief without my knowledge or consent obtained cash advances on 4 of my credit cards and somehow sent the money out on one of my checking accounts. ) The fraud dept sadistically insisted that as a woman age XXXX and high risk for covid go into a branch and refused to speak to me. No one was allowed to talk to me. No fraud forms were mailed to me asking for an explanation and a signature which proves they weren't doing anything. Finally, I lucked out with the TN call center and the total freeze was removed. I was able to close my demand deposit accounts. Previous complaints were ignored and their regulatory complaints rep refuses to call me back. Due to the compassion of one fraud person who made an appointment, I did go into the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX was masked and we were in his office. ( A very nasty and sadistic creature named XXXX at the XXXX fraud center stooped so low she took away my online banking when I called when I saw a {$2000.00} fraud credit card balance. ) At that time, only my card ending in XXXX hat was reissued and Iused, had a legitimate balance of {$200.00} ) XXXX showed me that the other credit cards had 0 balances. I sat in his office for an hour while he was on hold with the fraud dept, I left and he continued to hold for them for another hour. XXXX called me -his number is XXXX and advised me that the fraud claims were settled per his conversation ). I believe XXXX but he was given incorrect information. Sadly, the following XXXX claims are denied on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX : Account ending in XXXX Claim # XXXX amount {$2000.00} Account ending in XXXX Claim # XXXX amount {$1800.00} When the nightmare fraud was reported on XX/XX/XXXX, I was given reference # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Again, those fraudulent cash advances- which the bank fraud dept should have realized was not within any pattern I ever made. I never made a cash advance in my life!!!!!! It would have helped if they would have spoken to me. 

I am attaching a copy of my police report and even tho I had given the initial person XXXX the police report number, I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that it would help. Apparently, the bank was too inept to even ask for it or try to obtain it. I am attaching the police report. The investigator had to obtain a subpoena and I had called me to say the funds were transferred somehow to an entiry or person in Texas so she has no jurisdiction. I also contend that the fraud dept should have and could have stopped those transfers from going out. I am also attaching screen shots that show the bank knew there was fraud from the start and failed to do due dilligence. 

And ... ..apparently refusing or neglecting to investigate fraud is standard operating procedure with Bank of America and it is a widespread practice. I am attaching the civil complaint : XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of herself and all Plaintiff, Civil No. XXXX BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. , ) Defendant. 
CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Apparently,, I am not the only one whose fraud credit card claims are being ignored and they are holding the individual responsible - even tho the fraud was reported. 

I do not owe Bank of America the money and they totally neglected to investigate those fraud claims on 2 of my credit cards. I am also attaching the most recent screen shot showing those 2 balances. Who knows what else will show up."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX there was a fraudulent charge of {$9200.00} on my XXXX credit card with Bank of America. I immediately contacted the bank to report the fraud on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, contacted local police, filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission and put a fraud alert out for XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of America stating that my claim was resolved and that the fraudulent charge would be credited, and the charge was credited. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged {$9200.00} by Bank of America, reversing the credit. There was no communication from Bank of America about the reversal of the credit. I called the bank 's claims department on XX/XX/XXXX, but the bank employee was unable to tell me why the credit was reversed and was unable to undo the reversal. He stated that I will need to contact the claims department. 

I am being led around by Bank of America for a fraudulent charge that should have been taken cared of on the day it happened."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I paid the entire balance due of {$3000.00} on my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/2023, Bank of America took {$1800.00} directly out of my checking account to pay the balance that was listed on my most recent statement ( XX/XX/2023 ). My balance due was {$0.00}, and had been for nearly 2 weeks at the time BOA took my money. When I contacted them by phone, they said they could send me a check for the credit on my account and it would take up to 10 business days for me to receive it. I then contacted the office to close my account and was told it could take XXXX business days OR MORE to receive the refund of the money they stole from me on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The bank claimed that because I had "" autopay '' turned on, that they were authorized to take the amount that was due on my most recent statement, EVEN THOUGH I HAD PAID THE BALANCE IN FULL 2 WEEKS PRIOR. Now, BOA can earn interest on MY money they took from me without my authorization - money that I did not owe them. If this is a loophole in their business practices, this needs to be closed. Thank you!"

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I rented a car with XXXX/XXXX  at XXXX. XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. It was for 9 days. After nine days, on XX/XX/XXXX, we returned the car and flew to XXXX. When we returned the car, we filled out a complaint form with regard to an item we rented with the car ( a wireless modem ) and handed in our paperwork and were told a revised final receipt would be sent to us by email ( it wasn't ). 
When we got our credit card bill ( Bank of America ), we saw we were charged for 12 days instead of 9.  We contacted XXXX/XXXX  to get the invoice, and disputed the charge with Bank of America ; included with that dispute were copies of airline tickets showing we were flying on XX/XX/XXXX ). Bank of America will not take our side in the dispute since we had no final receipt saying when we turned in the car ( and now say we are "" timed out '' for disputing further ). We continue trying to get XXXX/XXXX to respond to our dispute. 

XXXX/XXXX supplied Bank of America ( and I ) a revised reciept showing the rental for 12 days. This was never authorized and is what I dispute."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Between the months of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2018, I was assessed a {$1.00} fee for "" Minimum Interest Charge '' when there was no balance shown on my credit card that was subject to an Interest Rate. Every monthly statement indicated there was "" Balance Subject to Interest Rate {$0.00} '' I contacted Bank of America on XX/XX/2018 and was informed by two different representative that there WAS a balance on the credit card subject to an interest charge. They confirmed that balance did not show on my monthly statement and I could only obtain that information by contacting them. They refused to issue a refund and indicated these charges were valid. 

I believe this to be a violation of Consumer Protection Laws such as Regulation E, Regulation Z, the Fair Credit Billing Act and the Credit CARD Act of 2009."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have reported to Bank of America four fraudulent charges to my credit card. All the charges were for XXXX. I have never had an XXXX account. I spoke with XXXX, who verifed that I do not have an account there. XXXX investigated and told me that someone else used my credit card fraudulently, and XXXX said they have now closed that account. However, Bank of America seems to have done no fraud investigation. Bank of America gave me a temporary credit for all four fraudulent XXXX charges, but then Bank of America charged one of the fraudulent charges back to me with no explanation. When I asked for an explanation they could not give me one. They said they would send me a letter about the chargeback but they did not. I feel that since I first reported the fraudulent charges to Bank of America on XX/XX/19 ( more than 90 days ago ), they have had ample time to do an investigation and resolve this. I am unable to determine why Bank of America has not resolved this problem because they will not give me information, and they have refused to let me speak with an investigator or supervisor. 
Here are the fraudulent charges from XXXX : XX/XX/19 {$1100.00} XX/XX/19 {$1300.00} XX/XX/19 {$6900.00} XX/XX/19 {$6900.00} I have contacted Bank of America about this problem on the following dates : XX/XX/19 XX/XX/19 XX/XX/19 XX/XX/19"
Credit card or prepaid card,I have 2 credit card accounts I would like to close with Bank of America. When callin in they place me on hold indefinitely.
Credit card or prepaid card,"This complaint is about a specific late fee policy with Bank of America Visa. I have already paid the fee, so that I can promptly and cleanly close my account. However, this particular policy seems like it should be illegal, and other people should not be taken advantage of going forward. Here are the details : My XX/XX/XXXX bill had a balance of {$89.00}, due by XX/XX/XXXX. 
My card has a cash back feature. Cash accumulates in your account until you either apply it to your bill, or request a check. I chose to apply {$89.00} from my cash back to my bill. It was credited to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, bringing my account balance to {$0.00}, prior to the due date. 

B of A then charged me a late fee of {$25.00} on my XXXX bill, and flagged my account as being past due, even though the balance was XXXX! I called B of A on XX/XX/XXXX for an explanation. They said that I still owed the minimum due amount, even though the balance was XXXX! The original person I spoke to also didnt understand this policy, and checked with their manager. They maintained that I would have had to pay {$25.00} more than was due! 

Nobody would interpret their still owe the minimum due policy in the same manner as they do. This policy seems to be aimed specifically at collecting additional late fees, from people who will not notice it, or will not contest it. If they really want a minimum payment from outside of the BofA account, then they should explicitly say so. As it stands, BofAs policy seems predatory, and should be illegal. 
Thanks, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CT XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,I currently have an XXXX card through my employer unfortunately it is through Bank of America this year. There have been SEVERAL issues where they allow the card to be used at valid medical related stores but then require additional invoices. After one such issue they stated that the code my XXXX  sent was not set up un in their system and would need a receipt to validate. I asked them why I was responsible for their system not being up to date and am more then flabergasted at the new need to provide additional documentation that was not required when using previous XXXX cards. The card currently has an available balance of {$680.00} dollars. When I went to the XXXX doctor the error on the machine stated that I could not use that card for the transaction. ( I am using the same XXXX doctor I have used for years and getting the same services I received the previous years. ) I have experienced NO ISSUES over the past 5 years using the non bank of America XXXX XXXX cards. I called Bank of America who stated that I did not turn in a receipt from XXXX for XXXX from a previous purchase and they suspended my card. I stated to them that there were NO previous issues using the card for XXXX from XXXX and that previous verification was not required. I also asked why they would even allow the transaction if the medical codes were not submitted. They stated that they needed the receipt for verification. I explained to them I did not keep the receipt as we have not had a need to in the past because it was XXXX purchased from the eye department at XXXX. I then asked them to approve the transaction for my current XXXX exam and XXXX they stated they could turn the card on in 2 hours. The store closed in an hour. The solution is BEYOND rediculous. I do not understand how Bank of America can put a hold on funds I contributed. At the time of the transaction at the XXXX doctor I had {$680.00} on the XXXX card and the total bill for the XXXX doctor was around {$250.00}. I could understand if it was an actual credit card but this is a prepaid XXXX  card that Bank of America turned off on their whim. I was embarrassed in front of the staff at my XXXX doctor and frustrated with Bank of America 's inability to explain why they needed a receipt for the exact same purchase that was approved previously from the same location without a receipt requirement. They also stated it would take up to 5 business days to be refunded for the costs once I submit my receipts for my XXXX  exam and XXXX AGAIN unacceptable. That account was for me to use when I need it for medical expenses. Dont get me wrong I am ok with an audit when things look out of the norm but my transactions are normal and have not changed in years. What should I have done if I did not have the cash in hand for the services? I obviously could not ask they XXXX  doctor to wait to get paid. How is it possible that Bank of America is allowed to provide an XXXX service without having their systems up to date with ALL acceptable billing codes? How can they legally deny me access to my funds immediately when I need them? What if this had been an emergency and I did not have the funds?
Credit card or prepaid card,"On or about  XXXX / XXXX / 17 , I applied for a card and was approved for a secured card. I subsequen tly 20 minut es later I called to cancel the card and void authorization to withdraw any funds from my account. I was told that it was done. On  XXXX / XXXX / 2017  Bank of America withdrew {$300.00} out of my checking account without authorization and have not produced a card or any documentation for the reason and have not refunded my money. Once again this institution has perpetrated a crime as far as I am concerned and has not answered for it. This makes a total of {$420.00} dollars taken without explanation, written or otherwise, but I require written."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX my laptop and other belongings were stolen from my vehicle that was parked outside my partners home. On XX/XX/XXXX my credit card from Bank of America was charged for a amount of {$1700.00} from a company named XXXX. I had previously used this site to purchase sneakers but the person that stole my laptop used my account and the saved info of my previous purchase to order something. What i didnt know was that they sent it to my house. For a while my sister and mother had dozens of packages that were going missing from our porch and I concluded that there was someone going around stealing packages. Maybe it was the person who stole my laptop and was trying to recover the order they had made. 
Bank of America is still not wanting to credit my account since this was a fraud and I have now filed the same claim 4 times over the course of 4 months and still no help. I dont know what to do no more and they are even charging me late fees for not paying the monthly payments."
Credit card or prepaid card,Bank of America closed two accounts without notice or explanation even though Id never missed a payment. Accounts ending in XXXX  and XXXX. Ive also attached screenshots of the multiple payments Ive made since account opening numbering in the XXXX  or sometimes XXXX  per month in payments.

Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX Dear CFPB friends, Topic : Not requested cancelation of my Credits cards In Bank Of America ( BOFA ) Who writes is XXXX XXXX and I am doing my best to explain what it is going on related to my complaint to Bank of America ( BOFA ) and how BOFA are violating my rights and affecting me and my husband moral, psychological, and economic : On XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America ( BOFA ) ( XXXX ) to request a letter that will indicate that XXXX XXXX XXXX is the primary account holder and XXXX XXXX, my husband, is an authorized user. In other words, a letter that indicate that my BOFA Credit card ( last 4 digits : XXXX ) is a jointly credit card between my husband, XXXX XXXX and I. 
I have needed that letter for XXXX purposes only. I have to clarify that I have requested and received this kind of letter on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ). 
XXXX XXXX was the BOFA employee who attended the phone call and took my request. The phone conversation with XXXX XXXX was normal and he told me that in one week I would be receiving the letter. 
Everything was good till 5 hours later when my husband tried to use his BOFA credit card and it was declined. 
XXXX called BOFA to ask about the incident and the employee said that the card was cancel by XXXX XXXX. 
First lie : I never called to cancel my Credit card ; I called to request the letter only. 
My husband called me immediately and explained what was going on with our Credit Card, once we finished talked I called the Bank of America ( BOFA ) ( XXXX ) asking for the activation of our credit card because I never asked to cancel it, in this opportunity I talked by phone to XXXX XXXX whom I explained everything what was happening and he was not able to resolve my problem because, according to him at that time ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) the department that work with this kind of situations was already close, instead he recommended me to call back the other day in the morning, Easter time to get the problem resolved. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called in the morning and XXXX XXXX was the BOFA employee to receive the phone call. I asked her for an explanation about not requested cancelation of my Credit Card and she said to me that XXXX XXXX made the cancelation ; XXXX XXXX is my husband. 
Second lie : XXXX XXXX can not cancel the Credit card because he is only an authorized user and not a primary account holder and according to BOFA regulations he is not authorized to do changes, cancelations and other issues in the account. 
After a few minutes of conversation with XXXX she transferred the phone call to XXXX XXXX, who could not resolve the confusion either and told me to study the case and they will call me the other day with an answer of my case. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called to BOFA again ( XXXX ) and I started taking to XXXX XXXX, who could not gave me any answer about my case and transfer the phone to her superior in the department to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX could not gave me any answer either and told me that she needed to LISTEN TO my first conversation to XXXX XXXX made on XX/XX/XXXX. After that listening she would call me back with a decision about my case. XXXX XXXX called me back on XX/XX/XXXX, without any answer and told me that XXXX XXXX XXXX will call me on XX/XX/XXXX about my case. 
On XX/XX/XXXX no one called me and on XX/XX/XXXX I  called and talked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX without any answer about my case. 

*On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to BOFA credit card department again and started talking to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX assured me that he has listened to the type made by XXXX and me on XX/XX/XXXX and in that type it was clear that I NEVER asked for a cancelation of my Credits Cards. So, the cancelation of my Credits cards was a mistake, XXXX XXXX XXXX said. 
In that order of ideas, the only thing that applies to my case is to reactivate my Credit card ipso-facto, because there are not ANY reasons to cancel it. 
I have an excellent record of payments, a fantastic Credit Scored, and a great relationship with BOFA. Actually, my primary account of my small company was open in BOFA and is active. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX instead reactivated my credits cards started a new process for the same credit card account and same number, according to him ; he started reading to me clauses for around 25 minutes, the same clauses that are reading to those new credits cards applicants. 
I insisted that because the cancelation was a mistake the only thing to do is a simple REACTIVATION. 
The conversation with XXXX XXXX XXXX finished an hour and a half minutes later assuring me that my credit card was approved because my credit score is good and to use the credit card I had to wait until the other day to use it again. 

Third Lie : Today is XX/XX/XXXX and my Credit card have not been activated yet. 

Final and Important Statement : According to Federal Regulations once any Bank have decided, for any reason to cancel an active Credit Card to anyone, the Bank employee must to read clearly and slowly to the Credit card user all the respective CLAUSES related to the cancelation. 
BOFA employees NEVER read to me any CLAUSES explaining the cancelation ; in that case ; they have violated all my rights. 
Having canceled my Credits Cards during these important Holidays has affected my husband and me greatly, causing huge moral, psychological problems and economic losses.

In speaking with the BA customer service dept. it was confirmed an error had been made by BA.

Not wanting to delay payment to the contractor, I asked if I could let the {$29.00} debit to my account stand and charge the remaining {$2800.00} due to the contractor on my BA Cash Rewards credit card.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, I am writing to complain about a harsh decision to close my small business accounts due to an honest mistake. I have all my banking with bank of america for last 15 years. I bank with them for my personal banking, small business banking and also hold investment portfolia and a wealth management account with them. According to bank of America, I am one of their platinum level customer who has established relationship of trust and credibility across all exchanges. I have had 3 lines of business operated under small business and recently with addition of new services and assets, I added additional 3 lines of business. To keep my invoice organized and up to do for flow of services within my lines of business I invoiced one of design services company to provide service towards tenant management service. As per bank of america this is prohibited, which doesnt make sense to me because it is a purchase and sale between my 2 companies even they they both belong to me.On a payment towards services from one company to other bank of america flagged my account and made a very very harsh decision to close all of my accounts with them. I called the respective team and they denied to rectify it. I also offered to retract whatever they had an issue with, however they were just not open to listening anything. One of the associates did understand where I was coming from and wanted to do a second review to the situation but the first associate denied it without much context. 

I trusted bank of america with all my business needs and year over year gave them revolving balance, wealth management accounts, merill edge investments and multiple business accounts. I have always paid my dues in time and established by credibility with each line of credit. Had i know that bank of america is not that sensitive towards maintaining a relationship with theor valued customer, I would not have placed all of my eggs in one basket and banked ONLY with bank of america. I trusted them as my service partner to assist with my small business needs however my trust is very badly broken for continuining to be aloyal customer. 

i would really ; ike this feed back to be considered because after this occurence, I know that I will have to take my business somewhere else and not trust bank of america with my banking needs."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have credit card with Bank of America, I have been a Bank Of America "" BOA '' for few years, and my account has always been in good term, without any late payment or no missed payment. About four months ago, I started receiving automatic calls from BOA with a warning that my account was late and my balance exceeded my available credit line. I immediately, called BOA and asked for explanation on the late payment and the exceeded credit line. I was in total shock after I was informed of my balance and the charges applied to my account. I have wanted to know how any type of charges could take place, when I never misplaced my credit card and the card was never out of my possession. I have warned BOA that this charges were not made by me and that they needed to find out how such charged with allowed. I also asked BOA, how come would they honor any charges that is over my limit be paid without confirming it with me if they were legitimate charges by me. BOA had the patterns of my credit card usages and should have known to alert me when activities other than my usual were taken place. Not only has BOA authorized payment to unusual activities, but it also went outside my credit limit to honor the purchases. 
I have requested for BOA to initiate a dispute claim, soon after that I received a form to be filled and to check all suspected or unauthorized charges, I completed the form and mailed it back to the dispute department address listed on the form. The dispute was never processed or my balance adjusted to the amount that was valid and owed by me. BOA continued to harass me with their automated calls demanding payments. In XXXX I called BOA with the assistance of a translator and after few transfers and an hour wait on hold, spoke to a person named 'XXXX '. This XXXX after hearing all the concerns around the charges had advised me that he will make a note on the account and was he was going to send a new set of forms that I will need to fill up and return and once received that BOA will take care of the dispute. I waited few months and never received any forms while my account continued to be past due and while the harassment with the auto-programmed collection calls. 

Again in XXXX I called BOA with my own translator, but BOA decided that has its own interpreter and will continue the call by having its interpreter join the conversation. After about a half an hour to the conversation the representative decided that the call will have to be transferred to another department who will handle the call farther, she indicated that there was no note on the account about a call being made in XXXX and having spoken to a XXXX, so it is obvious the person name XXXX never bothered to note the account on what took place during the conversation. So the call was transferred to another desk and put on hold for 45 minutes before a person came to the line, then after speaking with us for another 30 minutes on the issues she also decided she will transfer the call to a different department, again waited another half hour, before a man came to the line. He answered with a what can I do to help us, which at the time meant having to repeat addressing the same concern all over again for the fourth time, at that point I knew BOA just wasting my time and destroying my credit file, a credit file that was super excellent for years till this disputed charge occurred. The excellent credit file that I took pride in building is now destroyed by this neglectful and shameful way BOA handled my dispute. 
When there is charge on someone account and the account holder is not the person making this fraudulent charges, it typically means that one 's account number may have been improperly obtained by someone who is not authorized to use it. This can occur if a hacker succeeds in breaking into the computer system of the card issuer or I do not know how else, what I know is those charges were not done by me or by no one having my permission. BOA GROSSLY FAILED to properly investigate the charges what ever means it has to conclude the investigation and find for these charges to be INVALID and request for the MERCHANDISER to credit the amount back to my account."

We originally used a credit card for educational purposes. * On the statement it also says interest on purchases, we have NEVER used any balance transfers for anything but the initial transfer.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, without any explanation, they denied my claim and reversed all of the temporary credits. The letter they sent simply stated that they had reviewed my case and found that these were not fraudulent charges. That was it. 

I have called almost daily since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( the date I received the letter ), trying to get an explaination and documentation as to their findings. I have repeatidly asked for my money back.

When I asked them to satisfactorily verify that they who called me werent a scammer, they refused without the Social Security info. They then hung up.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for the Bank of America Cash Rewards Credit Card.

I visited their website and called to set up the card over the phone, where I was informed ( by both the website and person on the phone ) that the 0 % APR period was indeed for 15 billing cycles. 

Upon receiving my first statement on XX/XX/XXXX I was dismayed to find that my 0 % APR period was only for 12 billing cycles, and ended on XX/XX/XXXX instead of XX/XX/XXXX. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and an associate stated that when I applied the promotion was 0 % APR for 12 billing cycles, and that the promotion for 0 % APR for 15 billing cycles began on XX/XX/XXXX ( almost a whole month AFTER it was advertised to me, personally ). 

I was transferred to a Bank of America manager with the applications department, who listened to the recorded call I made to them on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmed that the associate told me the promotion was 0 % APR for 15 billing cycles. He apologized, but stated that they could not change the promotional period in their system. I reached a dead end. 

I believe that this is not the first time that Bank of America has misinformed their credit card applicants, and that it will not be the last unless something is done about it. That is why I am asking the CFPB to investigate Bank if Americas misleading advertisement, so the bank may pay closer attention and not mislead other customers.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I became a Bank of America customer back in XXXX. About five years later, they refused to block XXXX from making monthly charges to my account after I canceled their services and I had to close my BOFA account to prevent further charges from XXXX. 

Last month, XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to open new accounts with BOFA, because they are the nearest bank from where I currently live. I opened a checking account and a credit card account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to make a {$3000.00} payment to my BOFA credit card and noticed they had a new system to do it. It had to be done through "" XXXX XXXX '' and not directly as in the past. I clicked on my current BOFA credit card account, the only one shown on my dashboard and it took me to their "" XXXX XXXX '' system. It automatically showed BOFA credit card account and I thought it was the only one I have with them and did the {$3000.00} payment. The next day, I noticed the payment had not been applied and I had received no notification that was being processed so I called them and spoke with a representative. He said I had to give it more time to post but I requested a confirmation that the payment was being processed. He said I could see that on my XXXX XXXX transaction history. When I checked that I noticed the payment had been applied to my old credit card account which I asked them to close more than 4 years ago. Then the representative said it would take 60 days for them to research that. I was very disappointed and called them back today, XX/XX/XXXX and asked to speak with a manager. She confirmed it would take 60 days to research that and said I should have deleted my old account from their XXXX XXXX system. I told her that I never used their XXXX XXXX system before and never added my old account. She said she couldn't help further. 
I need the CFPB assist me with such unfair situation. BOFA should have closed my old account when I asked them to do so and their XXXX XXXX system should not have pulled an old account that I never aded myself, automatically. 
Now, I need to find extra money to at least make the minimum payment to my current BOFA card that has a balance of {$3600.00}. It's so unfair. I have never maid a late payment on any account and have never defaulted on any debt. Thanks in advance for your help."

I made two disputes because I didnt realize there were more charges from the same company that was fraudulently taking money out of my account. My first dispute was resolved in my favor, and then the second one was denied. How is that even possible? Because it was for a larger amount that they didnt want to pay? It was from the same exactly company that they found was in my favor for the first dispute. I am now in the process of a 45 day review to look at the decision. This is ridiculous!!!! I want my money back!!!! Look into the situation like you are paid to do, otherwise I will be taking steps further to ensure this gets resolved!"
Credit card or prepaid card,I have a credit due on my credit card balance due to an error in over payment of last month 's statement. This account has been closed since last year so I can not use the card to redeem the credit. I have contacted the issuer 3 weeks ago to no response.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2022 I applied for a credit card with Bank Of America. On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of America stating I needed to contact the credit bureau agency XXXX to ensure the information contained in my consumer statement was accurate The information that needed corrected was for my phone number to be added to the fraud alert. 
I reached out to XXXX for the request to add my contact number to the fraud alert. I was told by XXXX that my contact number was added I called back Bank Of American and I was told they would need to pull my credit to check. After it was pulled I was told my contact number was not added fraud alert and needed to called back XXXX. I called back XXXX and they told be I had to speak to the dispute department to add of which I did. After I was told it was added I called back Bank of America to informed them my contact number was added. I was told my credit will need to be pulled again. After it was pulled I was told my application was denied due to recent inquiries on my credit report. This is discriminative and I am very unhappy with the reason for the denial since 3 of the inquires was for the Bank of America credit card application"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Fraud dispute filed with Bank of America on or around XX/XX/XXXX for a charge of {$670.00} on my Customized cash rewards XXXX. This charge labeled "" XXXX XXXX "" occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. This transaction was completely un-authorized and charged without my consent and knowledge. 
On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America declined the dispute and reassessed the charges to my credit card statement without providing any evidence or reason as to why. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Fraud department to reopen the case and find out why they had not sent me any information regarding the decision. Another paypal charge of {$54.00}, that was missed was also added to the dispute. I also provided them with information and additional facts that should help them easily identify this fraudulent charge as fraudulent. 

Those facts are : a. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Bank of America stating my temporary credit of {$670.00} was made permanent and the dispute was ruled in my favor. But the credit was never added to my account 1. All XXXX transactions were supposed to be blocked on my account in the first place. I had a stop payment block placed on all paypal payments, for some reason this transaction was NOT blocked. 

2. Bank of America had originally flagged this charge as a fraudulent, but still let the charge occur. BOA SENT ME A TEXT MESSAGE CONFIRMING IT WAS FRADULENT. I DID NOT RESPOND TO THE TEXT MESSAGE, AS MY PHONE WAS DISCONENCTED AT THE TIME, DUE TO BEING OUT OF THE COUNTRY. When I arrived back in the US I saw the text messages and quickly called Bank of America to report the Fraud. TO REPEAT, I DID NOT respond to the BOA text message, nor did I even see it at the time. 

3. This transaction is well outside of my consumer spending habits. I have never spent over XXXX XXXX on the credit card. Usually for gasoline purchases as its a cash reward credit card. A {$670.00} charge is well outside of my spending habits, and should have immediately marked the charge as fraud. 

4. I was never sent any information on why this dispute was reversed. I did finally receive the letter in XXXX. 

Update : 5. On XX/XX/XXXX I did finally receive a letter from Bank of America explaining why they "" did not approve my recent claim ''. The letter says : '' We made this decision because : After you submitted your claim, you later confirmed that the charge ( XXXX ) were valid. '' This is COMPLETELY FALSE AND A LIE. I never once claimed the charges were valid. 

6. The employee from Regulatory complaints who contacted me was completely unhelpful in resolving this matter. Moreover she exhibited unprofessional behaviors by misspelling my last name which is clearly spelled in my email address. 

7. On XXXX I received a complaint resolution letter from BOA. The letter uses several instances of FALSE information that was used to deny my claim : The letter states : "" Our research confirms that on XX/XX/XXXX, we sent a text alert to a verified telephone number, which was responded to that the {$670.00} charge was valid. '' I NEVER RESPONDED TO THE TEXT MESSAGES. I have the records to prove it, and as I said previously, it was impossible for me to respond as I was out of the country and my phone was disconnected. AGAIN, you guys are blatantly lying in a completely unethical manner. 

In the letter, it states "" the claim was denied because after the claim was submitted, you later confirmed that the charge was valid. '' Let me repeat my self again, I NEVER ONCE CLAIMED THE CHARGES WERE VALID. You can not put words in people 's mouths and blatantly LIE, it's unethical and wrong.

Credit card or prepaid card,"The denial of my credit application on the XX/XX/2023 used several decisive factors as a basis for denying me access to my own credit. This is a violation of 15 U.S. Code ss 1611. The basis for denial are listed below for Bank of America >Presence of a recent inquiry on credit report >Balance on revolving trades >Current or past delinquency, derogatory public records and/or collection accounts >Number of days between inquiries The information is not only inaccurate, but has no legally-valid basis for consideration in making a credit approval decision. Under 15 U.S. Code 1681, Bank of America has engaged in adverse action by unlawfully denying me access to a line of credit. A letter detailing these violations has been mailed to Bank of America Underwriter on XX/XX/2023 to correct these errors."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened a Bank of America card. Made 1 purchase. Made a payment-got a letter a week later that my bank reversed the payment. I confirmed that my bank did not reverse any payment and in fact BOA did not attempt to take a payment at all. This has now happened 4 times. I call a live person at BOA to confirm my account information and they process another payment, give me a confirmation number, then I get a letter a week later, my bank reversed the payment. I have several thousand dollars in my account and BOA has my correct payment information. BOA is not taking payments and then tacking on late fees and reporting me to the credit bureau. I have excellent cred and this is affecting my credit, costing me fees, causing me extreme stress, and I am spending a ton of time on the phone with BOA and never get anywhere. It appears that I have not made a payment in months!! I am at a loss and have never had this problem ever! I feel this is intentional and fraudulent to get fees out of me and the problem is not me. I just want to pay by bill! 

I recorded all calls with BOA"
Credit card or prepaid card,"BANK OF AMERICA- I am submitting this in conjunction with the class-action lawsuit. I'm not looking to get any money I just want my rewards back! 

I booked a flight from XXXX NJ to Florida through my BoA ( business account ) rewards for XX/XX/2021. Due to COVID concerns I had to cancel my flight. I kept talking to the BoA travel center about cancelling my ticket but they kept dragging until the night prior and I ended up cancelling it myself. Then, I called BoA travel center once again to give me my XXXX points back. I was told they would do it, but they didn't move an inch. 

I was told that someone would call or e-mail in the next XXXX hours. Shortly after XXXX hours went by with no call, I posted a brief comment on the BoA XXXX page. A little while later, I got a call from a customer service person who said they were from BoA, but it turned out to be a fraud operation and they stole over {$4000.00} from my account via XXXX. Later, I realized that this operation saw my XXXX post, looked me up and found my # on my business website ( which I since removed ). I did not give them any private info, like my SS #, but they kept me on long enough over several calls, along with a fake XXXX call through to 'unblock a text authorization '. So, then I had to deal with the fraud, which to BoA 's credit they did resolve and refund my money within a few days. 

However, the points issue remained and I got so tired of all of it I let it go. But I want my XXXX points back! Even recently, I was chatting with the social media team on XXXX and they kept saying they would help but gave me a runaround. I can't take it and will likely switch my account to another bank but need to use the points I still have and WANT MY POINTS BACK! I earned those points and booked that flight and have suffered a lot of stress due to their shenanigans."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received an offer from Bank of America called accessing your credit is as easy as 1-2-3. It allowed me to use my credit card line of credit to obtain cash to pay off other credit cards. I used one of the checks included and deposited it in my Bank. I used the money to pay off my higher credit cards. On the Band of America credit card statements, I noticed that I am being charged a 21 % rate instead of the promised .99 % rate so I called the company to resolve the issue but I was told that the checks can only be used for balance transfer and they need to be directly used to pay off the credit cards. I looked at the BoA offer and it clearly stated that I can use it for anything I want in step 1 of the 1-2-3 easy-access advertisement. I used similar offers from other Banks in the past and I always deposited the funds in my Bank, as a customer I feel BoA is scamming its customers. I have lost over {$1100.00} dollars."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been going back and fourth between The EDD and the BOA taking turns waiting and verifying every time I get transferred and then get put on hold and either get hung up on. Or they tell me to call my sponsor. I call my sponsor they tell me call the BOA. All day long for three weeks straight. I have contacted Assembly Man XXXX XXXX abut this matter. I have been treated rudely, I have been hung up on after waiting on hold for over 2 and a half hours every time. Just to be hung up on. I had payments sent to that account and during the time my card was locked and pending verification. Well any funds that where put there between and XXXX all the way until XX/XX/XXXX I believe. The bank did not start denying payments from the EDD as of XX/XX/XXXX. It is really plain to see that my card was locked and funds were being removed. If the account was locked and card locked how did the funds get moved. I am tired of getting a run around I really need my payments and think it is really unfair that I have been waiting a very long time for my payments and here it is now XXXX about to be XXXX and still waiting."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This complaint is about the Bank of America and our billing dispute for {$62.00} for the company called XXXX and XXXX ( the 2 companies are now one ). The XXXX XXXX Deals, sold and advertised directly on their site are special promotions, generally at about 50 % off and they must be pre-paid by credit card. Their ads are savvy and enticing, and they must be pre-paid! 

They entice consumers to try merchants who they might not know about, which is great for the merchants. I only contacted XXXX XXXX ( a home XXXX XXXX XXXX ) because of this XXXX XXXX Deal, and when they came, instead of honoring our pre-paid Certificate, we had to write a check for {$160.00}, so we did pay double and we WILL NOT do business with XXXX XXXX or XXXX ( XXXX recently bought their competitor XXXX XXXX ). We ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX were really angry and upset that we were "" taken to the cleaners "" by XXXX XXXX. 

SInce XXXX XXXX, XXXX, when our billing dispute began, Bank of America has repeatedly asked us to send in dispute forms ( duplicate request -- all 3 disputes the same because they are not understanding ) ... and we also have sent proof of duplicate payments 3 times now, and are dragging their feet on honoring our card-member agreement and somehow act as though, they want to close the dispute, falsely claiming that I have not sent enough proof that even with a PAID CHECK ( BOTH SIDES ) I re-send this to them today by mail, because BOA wants to believe whatever lies XXXX XXXX is telling them, in response to our billing dispute on our Bank of America visa for {$62.00} because their Service provider, XXXX XXXX when they came to our home for our appointment on XXXX XXXX XXXX, REFUSED to honor our XXXX XXXX deal that we bought just 10 days earlier. ( PLEASE SEE ATTACHED ALL DOCUMENTS AND PAYMENTS ). 

The problem at XXXX XXXX/ XXXX is they do not offer customer service. We do know how to read and understand all terms and when you have a problem, they are not customer service oriented the way they used to be, their "" ONLINE CHAT ""  system at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX website is time consuming and they aregue down their customers with an "" upside down "" customer service policy that promotes this type of Fraud & Abuse. 

Further, BOA, Bank of America, seems most interested in protecting the GIANT company, ( XXXX ) rather than their consumers. 
We want the CFPB and the FTC to investigate BOTH Bank of America and also XXXX XXXX / XXXX for FALSE ADVERTISING/ DECEPTIVE advertising policies and other violations of Federal law that protects consumers from FRAUD."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My case was closed today after the company provided a response. When I read the response I wanted to offer feedback but the option was not allowed to open as the link stated file not found and the case was closed. Case number was  XXXX  against Bank of America who is charging late fees. In their response they stated the payments were automatically refunded, but this is not true as I had to call and was told by their staff I had to call to have them refunded. Overall I am not satisfied with their response and the overall length in time it took to respond if the response was that simple. There is no language to suggest that they will change their language as I had requested in my complaint."

Credit card or prepaid card,My name is XXXX XXXX and I received my credit card that has been in perfect standing for 5 years was being closed today because I added an authorized user whose credit was not in good standing. By all means I do not agree with this decision of closing my card and I would like my account to continue to be open and they can not add this person to my account. This closure will impact me deeply as I am trying to refinance during the pandemic and I can not afford my credit to take such a hard hit with the closing of this card. I was told I would get a letter and can contest the decision in 30 days however I don't want to wait that long and would this to be worked on as soon as possible. The account was closed today XX/XX/2020
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX my Bank of America card was charged {$64.00} for a XXXX XXXX XXXX controller that I did not order from XXXX. I found out about it because I received an email stating my order was on it's way. I called Bank of America and when I called, they also asked me if I had placed another order for a larger order of ( 4 ) controllers. I said no and they stopped that order. I filed a fraud charge and removed my credit card from my XXXX profile and also changed my password. 

Bank of America did give me a refund, but on XX/XX/XXXX reversed that refund. I still have the package unopened and I do not want it, did not order it and want XXXX  to pick it up. 

I have tried to call both XXXX and Bank of America several times and just get pushed around to different departments and put on hold to never get to the right person. Just today I was on hold with both companies for 1 1/2hrs."
Credit card or prepaid card,"When purchasing an XXXX XXXXXXXX ticket I was presented with an offer for an XXXX XXXXXXXX credit card. The offer that if you applied and were immediately approved, you could use the credit card to purchase the tickets, get free priority boarding, a free checked bag, and possibly other immediate benefits for the flights being booked. It also stated that if you spent more than {$3000.00} within 90 days you would get XXXX bonus miles, a statement credit, and a companion fair. 

XXXX Based on this promise, and the fact that I would be spending more than {$3000.00} on the airfare, hotel, and rental car, I applied for the card. Within seconds ( Sun, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ) I received an email stating that my application had been approved. I was not provided any means of purchasing the tickets at that time. I spent two hours trying to resolve the issue with the bank, even getting access to my Bank of America website, but no one was able to help me. I was told it was an issue with XXXX  XXXX website and to call them. XXXX  XXXX said that I would need to resolve this with the bank, but they had been having issues and I was not the only one to call in. 
<br><br> I attempted again to resolve the issue on XX/XX/XXXX, calling again both Bank of America and XXXX XXXX. Bank of America was no help at that point. XXXX XXXX told me to simply go through the checkout process and apply a second time as the first one probably did not go through. I did this and it worked. The total amount for the airfare was {$2400.00}. 

<br><br> After that purchase, I have been unable to use the credit card. It is declined every time I try to use it. I have been unable to place orders for my trip to qualify for the rewards. I have probably spent 3+ hours on the phone having my card unlocked, yet as soon as it's run again it's locked for fraud. I even had the hotel and the fraud department on the line at the same time and they were unable to allow the charge to go through. 

<br><br> I attempted multiple times to charge a XXXX XXXX car over two days Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and Sunday XX/XX/XXXX, with it always being declined. The car went up in price due to the delay, but the final amount I tried to charge was {$420.00}. 

<br><br> On several occasions I tried with the hotel, the last being Friday XX/XX/XXXX, when the hold on the room would expire if I did not pay. The total amount attempted to charge was {$1000.00} ) <br><br> On XX/XX/XXXX the hotel ran the card on 4-5 separate occasions, including on the phone with Bank of America XXXX After that the hotel refused to accept the card anymore and I had to pay with another card. 

<br><br> After the issue with the hotel, I attempted to have the issue escalated with Bank of America to try and resolve the issue. The agent I spoke with tried to have me speak with a supervisor, ended up chatting with one who said my card was locked for fraud... Which we knew... Asking to speak to someone, she spent a while trying to get a supervisor, but said when she reached one they just hung up on her. She ended up giving me a phone number to call later, which I did. I was told that maybe I needed to use the card in person and someone would call me back. After that call I tried to use the card in person for a small amount and it was approved. I did not recive a call back. 

<br><br> On XX/XX/XXXX I called the general number again and asked to speak to a supervisor. The agent I spoke with did not want to escalate and said she would submit a form requesting an extension to the spend requirements. I reiterated that I did not want an extension, I do not have any future expenses planned that I would qualify and I wanted the requirements waived. 

<br><br> Also during this time, it appears that Bank of America automatically enrolls me in electronic statements, which I do not want, and did not agree to. I have repeatedly brought this up while on the phone, and been told I am enrolled in paper statements, but I have not received my first statement. On the XX/XX/XXXX call, they have stated they are requesting another statement to be mailed. 

<br><br> At this point I do not know how to escalate the issue with Bank of America further."

Credit card or prepaid card,"For background : I recently experienced fraud on this account ( my phone was stolen, which contained this card in XXXX XXXX ), and BofA followed typical procedure and cancelled the old card and sent me a new one. For the past several weeks, when I attempt to go online to schedule a payment, I get an error messaging stating that I need to call customer service. After waiting a very long time on hold on the first call, an agent scheduled my payment but said that they were not sure why this was happening to me. They committed to getting back to me within 2-3 days. Two weeks later, I had not received a response, so I attempted to use the online feature again, and it still was not working. When I called, the second agent that I spoke to ( despite calling the exact XXXX # that the website indicated I should call ) tried to convince me that bill pay was XXXX because I had missed a payment ( how is that an acceptable solution? ). I informed her that I had not missed a payment, to which she insisted that I was wrong without providing any details. I then read the past two statements to her ( statement date, previous balance, amount due, due date, evidence of payments, confirmation numbers, etc ) and explained to her that what she was saying wasn't possible because the statement date for the charge in question was AFTER the date that she said the payment was due - said another way, I did not owe any money on the date she mentioned, and the charge that she was claiming was overdue is not due until XXXX XXXX, for which I have a scheduled payment and was able to provide a confirmation number. She did admit that she was incorrect, which is just unbelievable for a bank this large and systemically important, but then still could not solve my bill pay issue. At this point, it feels like Bank of American is trying to make paying bills difficult so that they can generate late fees. I'm happy to be wrong, but the evidence is not convincing that there are other motivations."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XX/XX/2023 I submitted a payment to Bank of America for payment to my credit card.

On XXXX XXXX I received another alert & sent a 3rd payment ; but was able to cancel this payment & the called the bank to see if I could cancel one of the other payments. The CS representative told me that both payments processed & that i would not be able to cancel or return the payment to my account until after it posted. On XXXX XX/XX/2023, I received two notices from BOA saying that both payments failed & that I was late. I reviewed my account & previously transferred funds on XXXX XXXX to cover these payments. Upon calling BOA the CS representative stated that there was insufficient funds in my account to cover the payments & as I look at the account this is not the case. I already transferred money to the account. 

here are my concerns : 1. Previously, I had only been late once on a credit card payment & it was for less than 5 days & BOA reduced my credit line 2. if BOA used the credit technology, I would have not received multiple "" Alerts '' telling me that my credit card payment was due & I wouldn't have made multiple payments 3. in an effort to charge customers late fees or reduce their credit line I suspect BOA is playing with their algorithms and picking and choosing which payments will be held & which will be paid & at what time 4. BOA has proven to reduce credit lines not based upon any standardly acceptable format, but rather periodic reviews by humans who apply non existent standards & reduce lines of credit based upon assumptions 5. the two failed payment notices ( which previously showed posted ) took longer than industry standard & did not take into account that money could have been transferred from other BOA account to cover these insufficiencies, had alerts & notices been timely"

'' Calling them again, I explained that I did not draw the funds out and that I was the only XXXX with the password. No other family member had that information.

They would only say that it was a transfer to another account and the transaction in question was authorized and posted correctly to my account. Claimed Resolved.

I reported the charges immediately to the bank by phone and stated that I did not make these charges and have never received the new card the bank issued for me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX my fraud claim was declined with a wording "" the chip was read, my PIN was entered, and/or you signed for the merchandise or service ''. They also stated they verified signed receipt or contract with the merchant. 
I called on XX/XX/XXXX to ask the bank about the transaction details, such as the merchant information ( location, phone number ), the amount of goods or services purchased, a receipt with my signature etc, but the bank was unable to provide any of it. I believe no investigation actually took place. Instead, they simply made me responsible for an enormous charge that I didn't make. During the call, the associate reopened the claim and told me she will inform me about the results in 3-4 weeks. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I sent Bank of America a follow-up letter asking to reverse the charges and provide an explanation to the denial of my fraud claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I made a follow up call to the Bank of America. I was informed that they did not have the information I requested available. And said "" as you were informed during your previous call it will take up to 90 business days ''. I was not informed about 90 business days during my previous call. They have also mentioned something about their shareholders, which I find impertinent to my case or providing me with the grounds for denial of my fraud claim. 
To provide context, I'm a XXXX XXXX and a single mother, and with their non-existent fraud prevention system, Bank of America just ruined every slim hope I had for ever becoming financially secure."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Good Evening, On XX/XX/2021 a check for XXXX was applied to my credit card. I became aware of this on XX/XX/2021 and I immediately contacted my bank and filed a claim. Unfortunately, the agent that I spoke with created two cases, one with an account number ending in XXXX which is not my account number and another for a total of XXXX ending in XXXX. As of XX/XX/2021 both cases were closed and I was left with a bill for XXXX and Bank of America provided me with no proof as to who could've committed this crime. They did however try to blame my husband who is the authorized user on my card. First of all, my husband would never write a check in order to receive money that we already have. Secondly, their is no way that he could've even done this due to the fact that we both work from home and he does n't drive, so I am his only means of transportation. Moreover after the denial from Bank of America I contacted XXXX and went ahead and filed a police report. XXXX was very helpful and provided me with guidance on how to move forward with filing my report. At this time, I am just waiting for Bank of America to re-review my case so that I can find out who actually did this. Furthermore, I did submit my police report to Bank of America along with a request for Identifying factors for the suspect. Lastly, this has been very troubling for me seeing as how this is my first time dealing with fraud in this way and to have your bank blame you is just so frustrating.

Reported to BofA, received new card with the same number XX/XX/XXXX - Fraudulent charge for {$1300.00}, reported immediately and was notified that chip was used ( likely the lost card, which number was not changed ). Received {$1300.00} credit. 
XX/XX/XXXX - Notified that claim was found to be legitimate due to chip usage and {$1300.00} credit was reversed ( balance of {$0.00} ). I requested claim be reopened, same result. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Filed police report on advice of BofA, sent police report to BofA and asked case to be re-opened, was assured this would be resolved quickly. 
XX/XX/XXXX - Received letter from BofA stating the claim has been resolved in my favora and a credit would be added to my account. No credit was added. I called back to BofA and was told they would reopen my case to get the credit added. 
XX/XX/XXXX - An ADDITIONAL {$1300.00} charge was added to my account by fraud claims. Now BofA is taking {$1300.00} from me ON TOP OF the original {$1300.00} fraudulent charge. 
XX/XX/XXXX - Call back and BofA tells me the reopened claim was denied, initially claims that they did not receive the police report and I would need to resend ( which I did ). However, a supervisor ( XXXX from Texas ) then confirms that they received the police report. Same supervisor then told me they need to reopen the claim again and require 10 business days to resolve, and that they can not resolve the problem immediately."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I initially contacted Bank of America ( BoA ) on XX/XX/XXXX regarding a disputed charge that a vendor acknowledged I previously paid but could not refund the charge immediately. The charge was to my local electricity company for {$500.00}. The vendor admitted that this charge was made in error, but I had to pay them in the immediate to turn my power back on. I know that BoA did not contact the vendor because I've spoken to the vendor numerous times since and receive confirmation that BoA did not contact them. The vendor recommended I file a dispute with my credit card company ( BoA ) as this was the quickest way to resolve the issue. On XX/XX/XXXX, BoA asked for additional documentation about my claim and a signed letter from me instructing them to continue to investigate. I was given the deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I completed the required paperwork and documentation and saved an electronic copy on my computer for upload via BoA 's portal. When I logged in, BoA has disabled the upload function 5 days prior to the stated deadline. I immediately contacted BoA in order to request this be re-opened. I reached a customer service agent and was assured the portal would be re-opened the next day. It was not. I then contacted BoA three more time that week with the same outcome. I was then told my claim was closed and would not be reimbursed ( although my ability to provide documentation was denied 5 days prior to the deadline ). I have seen talked to BoA three times and they have repeatedly been hung up on and denied any assurance that my claim would be re-opened. I faxed my documentation to BoA and still have not had my claim re-opened. I am 12 days away from my payment due date and this charge has still not been removed from my account because BoA has unfairly made it impossible for me to provide additional documentation about my claim. I have attached the paperwork and documentation BoA initially asked for to this complaint. I just need them to re-open my complaint and actually communicate and investigate."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made a 0 % balance transfer from XXXX Bank of America credit card of {$16000.00}. I paid a balance transfer fee of {$480.00}. I also use this credit card for daily purchases. On XX/XX/XXXX, there was a {$1.00} interest charge. On XX/XX/XXXX, I first noticed an interest charge of {$.00}. I called BOA and inquired about these interest charges. The customer service representative stated that if I do not pay my full balance of the balance transfer and the purchased charges, then i will be charged interest. This was never explained nor was could I find it clearly spelled out anywhere as part of the balance transfer. Had I known this, I would never had done the balance transfer. I paid off the balance transfer in XXXX of this year. After firmly communicating with the XXXX, he agreed to credit me both of the interest charges. What I explained to him, was that, it made no sense in any case. If I would have had the {$16000.00}, I would not have done a balance transfer. He told me not to use my card once I do a balance transfer. I ended our conversation gracefully. 

I pay all of my current purchases once the charges are cleared to avoid interest charges. 

I was not charged interest for the first 2 months of the balance transfer, so these charges make no sense. 

My concern is not for me in particular, but for those people, that don't have a XXXX and XXXX, like myself. I would venture to say that many people have this issue and don't know it and do not understand it."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I was defrauded by an auto mechanic in XXXX and I immediately reached out to Bank of America and Visa, the card issuer, to assist with consumer protection. I brought my car in for a FULL SYNTHETIC OIL CHANGE AND COMPLETE TUNE UP, but the mechanic performed a conventional oil change and only an incomplete tune up. When I collected my vehicle, I noticed on the receipt that this was not what had been discussed in person and by phone with the shop manager. The clerk informed me that management was away and I would have to call. I did, immediately, and spoke with tech, who apologetically conceded that they did not perform the agreed to repairs. He provided contact information and informed me that I could also expect to receive a call from his manager. When reached by phone, she similarly apologized and offered a partial refund and a re-do of some of the work. I agreed, but when I brought the vehicle back to the shop, the aging owner aggressively approached me. He overruled her on the refund and re-work and berated me in front of the customers. He invaded my personal space and I left the store with a warning that, had I stayed, I would need to involve the police because he was becoming belligerent. About 5-10 minutes, later I received a frantic call from the manager again asking me to return to the store for a partial refund. I informed her that I did not feel safe returning to the store and she admitted that he was out of control. I told her I would handle it with my card company and bank. The Bank of America representative assured me that I neednt worry and that my Visa/BOA card was fraud-protected. The man did not perform the work that was agreed to and I should be due for a full refund. I contacted the Better Business Bureau, but the shop did not cooperate. I similarly reached out to an association of auto mechanics. I eventually received a temporary credit for the charge. I thought this was over until Thursday, when, without warning, I saw that the amount of {$460.00} was withdrawn from my account. I had not even been consulted. Had they asked, I could have included further testimony and documentation. This man, whos shop is currently 1-star rated, did not perform the work he was paid to complete and then physically threatened me when I attempted to resolve the problem. He did perform some work, but it was not what was paid for. I was completely defrauded and the card company inexplicably sided with a merchant with a history of intimidation and shoddy workmanship. I am flabbergasted and have since reached out to local news media about both the mechanic shop and Visas response."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/23, I received a package from XXXX 's that was delivered to my apartment building and left by the mailbox. The courier sent me an alert with a photo via email of the package in my building. When I returned home from work that day, which was approximately 2 hours after delivery, the package was nowhere to be found. I filed a claim with XXXX 's regarding the package being most likely stolen, and so they issued me a refund for the amount plus the shipping I paid. However, I was then informed that they couldn't actually issue me a refund when I called back to tell them the refund had not appeared on my card. The full refund would have amount to {$330.00}. 

I was informed by a representative that the person who clearly stole my package had brought it back to the store it was ordered from, and had exchanged it for XXXX perfume. So since XXXX 's "" technically '' issued "" me '' a refund or exchange, they claimed they could not issue ME the actual refund which is why I needed to take it up with my credit card. 

I received correspondence from my credit card with Bank of America which was used for the purchase saying that they issued me the credit while an investigation was done with XXXX XXXX. 

Around XX/XX/23, I received another letter from BoA saying that the claim was denied in the end and that the credit would be reversed back into a charge on my card. The reasoning behind the denial of the claim was "" that the merchandise was available and delivered to the agreed upon location. '' BoA told me they are not responsible for the charge and that XXXX XXXX is also not willing to issue me the refund. 

However, I feel I should not be responsible for paying this amount due to the fact that I never actually got the package, and the fact that XXXX 's actually got the merchandise back."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/23, I received a notification from XXXX that a new inquiry ( hard pull ) of my credit was requested by several banks ( XXXX, XXXX, and Bank of America ). I reached out to XXXX & XXXX, and their teams promptly addressed my issue and resolved it in less than 1 call. 

That same afternoon I called the B of A number listed as the contact on the inquiry and waited on hold for 20 mins. I gave up and called back on XXXX, finally reaching a representative that couldn't help but instead transferred me to their fraud team. The fraud team could not locate anything and returned me to the applications team. I was again on hold for another 15 mins waiting for someone to pick up. The representative was still unable to locate the application after several minutes, saying she needed a zip code and ssn to pull up any application. I let her know a fraudster could have given 1 of over 40k zip codes in the US. I then asked to speak with a supervisor, and she repeated the same line of questioning from the initial representative and then offered to transfer me to fraud which I had already talked with. 

Eventually, she said she would have to escalate this to a special team, and it would take 48 business hours for me to receive a phone call. In this day in age of identity theft, for one of the 4 biggest banks in this country to have this broken process of reporting identity theft is baffling."

Credit card or prepaid card,"To Whom It May Concern, On XX/XX/2022, I booked a flight from XXXX to XXXX XXXX on XXXX. I confirmed the flight had free cancellation within 24 hours. According to XXXX policy, I reached out to the airline directly within the 24 hour period to cancel my flight, however I was unable to get in touch with anyone from the airline on either their website or by phone. So I reached out to XXXX customer service line and they 1 ) confirmed the flight was cancellable within 24 hours for free 2 ) finally reached an agent from the airline, but the agent said they could not help. I tried to call the airline again using a different phone number XXXX gave me, but was unable to reach anyone.

After the 24 hour period elapsed, I reached out again to both the airline and XXXX, but they have not been able to assist. XXXX is telling me I have to speak to the airline directly, while the airline is saying they can not find my flight record. 

I have attached the relevant documentation with notes in the following pages. Do not hesitate to reach out at XXXX if you have any questions. Thank you very much for your help. 

Best, XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XXXX of XXXX I opened a XXXX XXXX credit card through Bank of America because of a promotional offering I saw on XXXX XXXX 's website. The promotion, which is still valid and displayed in a screen recording I attached below, says if you apply for the credit card you get XXXX points equivalent to {$100.00} in onboard credit. I applied, was approved, and purchased the cruise with my points. I used the credit card towards the first payment of a cruise I just completed from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was finalizing my plans for my vacation : checking flight reservations, hotel reservations, etc. I called XXXX XXXX customer service to ensure the room I was assigned had a XXXX  XXXX  bed, not XXXX XXXX, and my {$100.00} in onboard credit was showing on their system since I wasn't sure if the credit card automatically linked to my reservation. XXXX XXXX customer service told me there was no onboard credit displaying and to contact the bank. 

After learning my onboard credit was not displaying with XXXX XXXX, I called Bank of America. A customer service representative instructed me to call XXXX, a company I had never heard of, seen any communications via email from, or knew existed. Bank of America informed me, a year after I opened this credit card, that my points were not managed with the bank or XXXX XXXX but instead this other company over the phone during this call. 

I called XXXX, and a customer service representative told me I could not convert these points in to an onboard credit for my then upcoming cruise. I was informed all point redemption must occur a week prior to sailing. I explained I was never informed of this policy, never knew XXXX existed, and was never told I had to digitally manage my points prior to my cruise. In an attempt to resolve the matter I asked if there was an exception or expedited way to redeem my points since at this point I was not sailing for another XXXX days. The customer service representative told me the points could not be redeemed because of a deadline put in place by Bank of America and to call Bank of America. 

I called Bank of America again to no avail. They informed me there was nothing they could do since all points had to be managed by XXXX. 

By the end of the day, I had spoken to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Bank of America for a combined time of XXXX minutes. I'm very disappointed in XXXX and Bank of America for their lack of transparency and failure to offer a resolution. I felt these were very deceptive practices, to promote a credit card saying signing up rewards XXXX points equal to a {$100.00} onboard credit and no where in the promotion or website advertisement mention these points had to be redeemed within a certain time frame. I explained this to the XXXX representative to which I was in essence told they don't care and it's in the terms and service. I informed them I understand the process of acquiring the onboard credit is probably buried somewhere in their terms and services but was never communicated to me nor was made apparent in their promotional materials. 

I also found this matter very unfair and deceptive on Bank of America 's end. The promotion ran on XXXX XXXX 's website, and then again on Bank of America 's website on the application process as shown in the attached screenshot, is to incentivize customers to join the XXXX XXXX credit card through Bank of America. After acquiring the credit card I received XXXX emails from Bank of America, two to introduce app features, four highlighting cash-back and other incentives with the card, and none introducing or explaining the XXXX company XXXX process, or deadlines. 

If points had to be managed digitally seven days before the cruise, I see no reason why this information was not explicitly stated to me. I also do not see why Bank of America or XXXX XXXX could not have sent an email reminder seven days prior to sailing informing me of this apparently urgent deadline when I received many others reminding me to complete other items. 

Ultimately, I feel the XXXX XXXX credit card was deceptive in it's promotional offering. I told my sister about this promotional offer and she was put in this same situation where we both missed our {$100.00} onboard credit. To never state the XXXX relationship, provide transparency in managing points, or remind consumers of artificial deadlines is infuriating and comes off as a desperate way to prevent consumers from redeeming their points."

I have not received a credit to my account. BofA has supposedly has "" Zero Liability '' for fraudulent charges. I guess just not for me. EFTA states banks have to investigate claims and/or credit the account within 10 days of original report, this clearly has not happened. The stress of having someone steal from you is sickening but having to deal with the stress that Bank of America is putting me through is unbearable. I am a widow, a single mom, its the holidays, rent is due and I have mouths to feed and no money. The victims of fraud are being treated worse than the people who committed the fraud.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have communicated with the creditor several times in reference to an account ( s ) that has been opened under my name fraudulently. On XX/XX/20 upon the request of the creditor, I supplied Bank of America N.A, and all CRAs ( credit reporting agencies ) a copy of Identity Theft reports and an explanation outlining the Identity Theft and misuse of personal information. The creditor has been reluctant to investigate and has misled me in several occasions while in communication with their customer service and/or fraud department. The credit reporting agencies have stated that the creditor has "" verified the information '' yet has failed to substantiate my request for documentation."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX around XXXX ; I received a phone call at my office stating that she was agent XXXX XXXX with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I was told the IRS sent her information that my identity had been stolen, and the perpetrator had outstanding taxes owed. An arrest warrant would be issued in my name if the taxes were n't paid immediately. From this point, She told me that she needed to confirm my bank account information to make a withdrawal, she knew my checking and routing numbers, which led me to believe she was indeed with the FBI. I did n't have enough in my checking at the time, so she told me to use credit cards to pay the taxes instead. To make a very long story short, I spent the rest of the day running around buying gift cards in large amounts ( $ XXXX {$3000.00} ), where no one who knew about the scam questioned me and allowed me to make such purchases. 

Finally, the next Day I realized it was an elaborate scam and I immediately called Bank of America to report that I had fallen victim to this scam. I filed fraud disputes for all of the transactions that were solely because of this scam. I then immediately filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, and was told by the FTC that the stores where I made the purchases should 've questioned me on the large dollar gift card purchases, and that this would be looked into. 

After doing some research I came across an article that stated that victims of scams can only be charged {$50.00} if the unauthorized transactions were reported within three business days, the article also mentioned that transactions that were conducted by consumers being misled by scammers would also be recognized as unauthorized, and therefore covered under "" Regulation E ''. 

A few days later, I checked my credit card account only to discover that the total amount disputed had, in fact, been charged to my credit card. I realized that the bank had denied my claim. I have consistently been a fiscally responsible person all my life, and banked with Bank of America for several years, only to have this happen to me. I know this will reflect poorly on my excellent credit score, and believe that people should be protected against situations such as this. Bank of America is apparently known for denying claims like this, and I would like my rights honored."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Short summary : Bank of America 's "" AutoPay '' feature is deceptive -- it leads you to think that you're paying the amount due in full when only you're paying the minimum amount due. The rep I talked to agreed with me that the AutoPay feature was deceptive. Then BOA misstated its Regulation Z billing error resolution obligations : when I tried to dispute the fee I was told that only merchandise disputes are errors. 

Longer summary : I set up AutoPay on my Bank of America credit card and I found the options very confusing. Ultimately I chose the wrong one and incurred fees that I shouldn't have incurred. I wanted to choose the AutoPay option that would automatically pay the full amount due on the card every month. Of the options available, the first one was "" Amount Due. '' The second option was "" Minimum Amount Due. '' Because I knew that I didn't want to pay the minimum, I wanted to pay the full amount on the card, I chose the first option. After incurring a {$28.00} interest fee, I called BOA. A call representative told me that "" Amount Due '' was not actually the amount due on the statement, it was in fact the "" Minimum Amount Due. '' He said that there was no difference between the two options. When I said that I thought this was deceptive, he agreed. He said that BOA was working through various options which was why they were both listed. He refused to refund me the interest fee and told me that no supervisors were available to speak with me. When I said that I wanted to dispute the interest charge, he told me that a disputed fee was not an error, only a merchandise dispute was an error. Obviously that's not true -- there are lots of billing errors that aren't merchandise disputes. Then I talked with another rep to close my credit card and she also agreed that credit cards have deceptive features and that I should make a complaint so that BOA could fix the problem."

However, my biological mother and grandmother had an checking account opened at BOA in my name that I was unaware of in XXXX. I was then sent a letter with a pin number selected for me and that the card would come in a separate letter. The card never came in the mail. I also never received the card ending in XXXX. I reported card lost or stolen. Then I was sent a new card with a new account number ending in XXXX.

After I closed cable service in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX those cable boxes in my name somehow went into circulation and these individuals keep access my bank accounts this way to transfer money. BOA then told me because they detected fraud on my card in XXXX they closed the account and opened a new account ending in XXXX and mailed me a new card. I later received second hand information that the first two accounts mentioned where still active and different individuals were using XXXX to make purchases to embezzle money out of the accounts that I though were closed to get access to a trust that I was unaware of that I had. I closed the account ending in XXXX once I paid off balance. The last statement I received was in XX/XX/XXXX. I had also used this card as a bill and proof of residence when I applied for XXXX XXXX Assistance to cover a doctor visit at the hospital. However, I order to apply for this assistance it states that you give XXXX permission to hold any settlement money due to you to cover your doctor bills if you should be expecting a money in the near future. This card was then fraudulently kept on file to get access to bank account and multiple medical professionals created fraudulent records and documents to bill out for medical treatment I was never there for nor had I consented to the treatments. The XXXX FBI noticed this fraud in the account and billing at XXXX XXXX XXXX. Again all of these above accounts should be closed. These accounts are tied to an XXXX report with ATT # XXXX and FCC # XXXX. It also affected my bank account at XXXX. XXXX CFPB # XXXX for XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, My complaint currently Is against Bank Of America card. My application ID was XXXX. At this time, I feel the company is being discriminated since I have a last name of XXXX and they will not issue me a card at this time. 
Thanks so much for hearing me out XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Summary ( detailed notes below ) : XX/XX/2017 : I discovered that Bank of America issued a credit card to somebody I do not know and linked it to my account. The other person incurred roughly {$800.00} in charges that were tied to my account. BoA told me this was a case of credit card fraud and reversed the charges. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received an e-mail that the new credit card I requested was on the way. I had not requested a new card. The e-mail stated the card was being mailed to the same address as the previous card. A supervisor first told me BoA never sent me this e-mail and it was a phishing scam. After proving ( with a XXXX tracking number ) that the bank did send me this e-mail and was mailing out another card, I was again told this was a case of fraud. I was advised to call the police in XXXX, Illinois, where the cards were being sent, and ask them to investigate. After I called the police, BoA then called me back to tell me it was actually their mistake and they had issued a card to someone with the same name as me. They assured me the issue was resolved. 

At this point, my banking information had been shared with a stranger, and I was given access to all of that person 's credit card purchases, phone numbers, e-mail address, and mailing address. I also requested confirmation that the other person involved be given a thorough and accurate information that this happened. 

I asked to speak with someone who could explain how this had happened. In numerous phone calls, I was passed from department to department. Nobody at the bank has been willing to give clear answers to my questions. On one occasion, a supervisor told me someone from their digital services department had attempted to call me and had left a voicemail. She verified the number to which this supposed call was made was my number. I never received this supposed voicemail ; furthermore, according to my phone company records, there were no incoming calls made to my number on the date and time BoA claims it called me. After going through these records, the supervisor who insisted someone had tried to call me changed her story and said she could not understand his notes and wasn't sure whether he called or not. She assured me that the issue of mistaken identity had been resolved. When I asked how the bank could issue a credit card without cross-referencing a social security number, she referred me to another department, which has failed to follow up. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After being assured this case had been adequately handled, I discovered that for the third time, a stranger 's phone number and e-mail address had been added to my account. 

In follow-up calls to BoA, supervisors have been dismissive, constantly passing me off to other people in other departments. I have asked for a detailed explanation as to how this happened and what specific steps they had taken to ensure this will not happen again. They have not answered my questions other than to say, "" Oops, we had a computer glitch! '' In XX/XX/XXXX, a BoA supervisor recommended, before it was discovered this was the bank 's error, that I sign up for two years of credit monitoring. Bank of America has now acknowledged this was the bank 's fault. I am requesting they pay for this service, and also provide me with thorough information on how this happened, what information the other party involved ( the credit card recipient ) has received ( as it is important he knows a stranger was given detailed access to his financial information ), and what specific steps they have taken to ensure this will not happen again. I find it particularly disturbing that I was reassured on multiple occasions that the situation was resolved, only to see it happen again a few weeks later. 

I feel Bank of America has been negligent in its handling of my personal information, and dismissive in responding to my requests for information. I have had to repeat this entire, very long story multiple times to new supervisors because each time I speak with somebody, they do not follow up, and the bank has told me it is not possible for me to speak with the people I have spoken with about this previously. 

( Please see attached file for more thorough details. )"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I disputed a charge of {$490.00} dated on XX/XX/2021 with Bank of America. I also disputed other charges associated with a hotel stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX  XXXX, VA due to unsanitary, unsafe, and discriminatory experience. While Bank of America resolved all other charges disputed in my favor, they refused to resolve the {$490.00}. They allegedly needed documentation submitted which I did, but they said they couldnt do anything. Meanwhile, when I spoke with them they seemed to agree that the conditions of the hotel stay were not great. I believe this is unfair. I tried resolving this matter with the Better Business Bureau reaching out directly to the hotel, but the hotel would not respond so the case was closed. I was hoping that Bank of America would help but they were only willing to remove the smaller charges and not the larger amount which is a bit suspicious to me."

I had made a purchase with that company earlier that year & they kept my card info on file! When I contacted the company they issued a credit on XX/XX/XXXX, but on that same day that amount was charged again! XXXX XXXX said it was a mistake made by my credit card company. They told me it was my problem to deal with ( even though they initiated the problem with the initial false charge ) Over the last 10 months I have made several calls to BOA. The last two reps I spoke with said it was a glitch in the system and the charge would be removed. That hasn't happened. I closed the account, but continue to get billed for the amount plus interest and late fees. It is extremely frustrating as every time I call, I'm always directed to someone new, so I have to begin all over with the history of the problem. They never provide proof of what they tell me regarding the removal of the false charge. I've spent a so much valuable time on this with absolutely no help from this company."

Tracking number : XXXX I received a response from them but they did not provide the documents that I am asking and they did not update the credit report as disputed. 

I already paid the debt and want the account removed from my credit report. 

Bank of America is violating the FCRA for reporting this account with inconsistent and inaccurate information that I disputed which they then did not update to the credit reporting agencies as "" disputed '' and continues to report inconsistent account information which is in direct violation of the FCRA."

This all happened after I called Bank of America customer service in order to check with them to see if I can get promotional balance transfer to my 2nd credit with credit line of XXXX where I wanted to consolidate my debt in one single payment and help my self to pay off things faster. Few min later lady came back on the phone and said that she will immediate close my 2nd credit card, and lower balance on the first credit card to {$6400.00} due to income debt ration. I asked her what are the proofs you have on file for my income and how truly you know how much money I make? She repeated that my cc will be closed and no questioned asked and credit line lower on the other one. I told her, after 10+ years of loyalty with you, never missed payment, never defaulted, all balanced paid off, i asked first time for the help and instead to help me out you made things even worse. After they closed cc and lower credit line to my cc, my credit score dropped so bad and hurt me very bad. I called few times after to talk to managers, they promise to call me back and never did in order to get credit line back.

Next the support rep said the amount was properly applied in the computer, but did not show on statement. ( At one point the rep said they accidently sent another statement so just ignore it ) We asked if the statement would reflect the correct balance? Answer : No. We asked if the computer shows the money applied, why would it print an incorrect statement? Answer : The computer prints what it prints and can not be changed. We are concerned there might be some embezzlement or fraud. Without audit our statements and payments have not reconciled since at least XXXX 2017, but that involves filing a separate complaint.

Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, charged me more than double what they said they would charge ahead of time. The XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, said there was unexpected XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so he should have expected a lot of XXXX  but he did not require me to stop taking fish oil, which is a XXXX  XXXX, before XXXX. The assistant XXXX, XXXX XXXX, had a different story that there was not much XXXX. The hospital charged me {$5000.00} XXXX, {$100000.00} XXXX, for items to stop XXXX  that cost {$35.00} XXXX XXXX of the items to stop XXXX  is merely purified potato starch. The hospital contracts were only in XXXX, which I am not fluent in, so the contract is invalid. Plus, the advocate XXXX XXXX hired, XXXX XXXX who claims to be the hospitals international patients coordinator, tried to rush me through the contract signing process. 
This is a change from XXXX when I had XXXX XXXX to remove a XXXX XXXX at the same hospital and with the same XXXX. Back then, the hospital contracts were in XXXX and XXXX. I was also on a package so even though I stayed twice as long as XXXX XXXX said I would, the price was the same. The hospital told my medical travel patient advocate, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ; XXXX ), that I was on a package again but then charged me more than double that price. XXXX XXXX told XXXX XXXX that a contrast XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX would be done before XXXX and that would be included in his surgical fees. However, no contrast XXXX  was done before XXXX, instead he relied on the XXXX  without contrast that found the XXXX XXXX. I had a XXXX XXXX XXXX  but that was charged to me in addition to XXXX XXXX 's XXXX  fees of {$6000.00} XXXX. In addition, XXXX XXXX charged me an additional {$3500.00} XXXX for renting surgical equipment but XXXX XXXX refused to provide a receipt from the company he rented the equipment from, stating that she had been hired by XXXX XXXX for my XXXX, which is something I did not consent to and no doubt increases the price XXXX XXXX charges. XXXX XXXX staff came to my hospital room to collect funds while I was trying to change clothes. This is unprofessional. 
XXXX XXXX told XXXX XXXX that he does not decide on XXXX  XXXX  until 15 to 30 days after XXXX ; however, since I could not stand or walk after XXXX, she insisted he start me on physical therapy right away. I still was unable to walk after 9 days in the hospital and XXXX XXXX said I had to leave the hospital to avoid XXXX. If my inability to walk had been planned for rather than XXXX XXXX 's over optimistic predictions, it would not have been a mad rush to get me into a XXXX home, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which did not have air conditioning and the care was poor since I was not given a call button when I checked in and was left alone for up to XXXX hours without being able to walk. 
XXXX XXXX 's surgical report made it sound like there were two XXXX XXXX, which there weren't, and that he ordered them, but he did not order any XXXX XXXX. His report also claims he mentioned physical therapy in the consult the day before XXXX, which he did not do. He mostly ignores my contact and now a XXXX  that is sometimes hotter than the rest of my back developed at the XXXX  site. I had to liquidate my XXXX XXXX  to pay for XXXX XXXX in XXXX, I maxed out the loan against my life insurance for major XXXX in XXXX and it seems to be too late to pull equity out of my house now for these unexpected charges because interest rates are rising. 
Bank of America has not provided me with the documentation the XXXX  sent them in response to my dispute despite requesting it well over a dozen times in the last several months. It is literally impossible for me to respond without knowing what the hospital said. Bank of America obviously only cares about pandering to the XXXX  since it is a large financial entity and they could not care less about this massive expense that is beyond my means and not what I agreed to. I contacted the hospital as well and they said they have not heard from their medical director. The XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America statement that they recently issued says "" {$3300.00} is in dispute. '' The XXXX, XXXX and XXXX statements didn't mention disputes."

No where does it state that B of A will start charging me interest on my regular purchases from the date of the access check. Usually one has a free month to pay the credit card bill. I pay off my purchases each month. 

The credit card bill for XXXX XXXX arrived. It did not show a minimum payment for just the Access Check amount. I called B of A Customer Service to ask about this and was told by two people that there is one minimum covering both purchases and Access Check amounts and that B of A was charging their standard 18.49 % on purchases from the date the Access Check posted. The statement does not CLEARLY state this and the language on the Access Check does not, either. I pay off my purchases each month and wanted to pay a minimum on the access check each month. 

I would not have used the Access Check has I known that B of A would start charging me on my purchases and take away my free month to pay. 

This is very misleading and unethical marketing. I scrounged around and paid off the whole balance to be rid of these people. I would like you to pursue this unethical marketing."

This account closure : 1. Was done without my consent. 
1. Was made without appropriate notification from Bank of America. 
2. Was done without appropriate legal justification. 
3. Was not done in accordance with the policies set out by Bank of America upon opening of the account.

Nor have I received any explanation as to why my account was closed and my funds taken. 

This is a very large issue for me as I lost my job working in hospitality due to Covid and the loss of {$3500.00} represents a significant impact on my livelihood and ability to survive over the last 8 months.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hi, Basically, I opened a credit card account with Bank of America. There was an offer when I opened the credit card. I needed to spend {$12000.00} in 6 months on the card to get the offer. I also paid a {$90.00} annual fee on the card. 

The card was closed without my consent by Bank of America. I called to inquire and did n't really get an answer why. This is conjecture, but I think they may have cancelled the account so that I would not receive the bonus and they 'd get to keep the annual fee. 

In the ~3 months the card was open, I spent about {$7000.00} on the card. I would definitely have spent the full {$12000.00} on the card within 6 months as I had some expenses coming up. 

When I spoke with a representative from BofA, he sent my concerns to another department. The other department said I was ineligible for any or all of the bonus because I did not meet the spending requirement. When pressed that I did n't have the entire length of time to meet the requirement, I basically got non-answers or a repetition that I did n't spend {$12000.00}. 

I believe this to be unfair. I believe that I did not have the opportunity to meet the remainder of the qualifications because they cancelled the card early. Additionally, I would have spent the {$7000.00} on a different card had I known that BofA would cancel the card before allowing me to meet the spend. I would completely understand if I was only eligible for a prorated amount of the bonus based on the spending completed ( and I offered this as a reasonable compromise ), but even that was denied. 

Additionally, I think the annual fee should be refunded. I paid for a year worth of benefits but was unable to use the benefits at all because the card was cancelled ( I would have used the benefits this winter ). Between not getting a bonus and not getting to use any benefits, I feel ripped off. 

Finally, I feel like I have made reasonable requests to the bank, whom I have been a long time customer with, which they have repeatedly denied. 

Thank you for your time."

On XXXX I received a letter denying my fraud claim. I then contacted their fraud department asking about how to appeal that decision and was told I would have to contact the retailer XXXX XXXX XXXX that allowed the fraudulent charges and my fraud claim would be kept open. I, twice, by email, requested XXXX XXXX XXXX send me information regarding the fraudulent charges but they refused to give me information. I also sent information to Bank of America by mail indicating that there were fraudulent charges on XXXX. I filed a Identity Theft Report with the Federal Trade Commission on XXXX as well since it was clear that someone was able to use my credit card to initiate an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX in my name and continue to order items. As of XXXX I have yet to receive any communication from Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX has refused my request for information. Therefore I am at an impasse and would like some assistance in resolving this issues."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to change my payment method with Bank of America to my new bank account. Unlike EVERY OTHER XXXX who connects to my new bank using PLAID, Bank of America informed me that it must first make deposits in my account which I would later confirm. This occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. ( PLAID takes about XXXX minute per account. ) I confirmed the amounts and verified my new bank account. Every current Bank of America currently says to login and click XXXX XXXX on their first page to change my auto pay. Of coursethere is literally nothing on ANY account page that says XXXX XXXX. Instead, I went into Payments, saw my scheduled payment for XXXX, clicked Edit Payment andit would only let me use the OLD bank account. No problem, I will set it up again. I returned to the Payment screen, clicked CANCEL PAYMENT several times and realized it was only canceling payment on a month-to-month basis. No problem, I went to Manage Payment Methods, DELETED the old account, checked that this deleted all scheduled payments, and tried to set up a new paymentbut where? 

Eventually, I found that there was a VERY SMALL link that says XXXX. I set this up for my next due date and minimum payment. I received a confirmation that I read as my autopsy being confirmed and my next due date. Perfect. 

XXXX never showed up in my scheduled payments. So I called and after XXXX minutes I was told they payments set up on XX/XX/XXXX would not be in effect until XX/XX/XXXX over XXXX weeks later. I was also told that it would NOT show up in scheduled payments until XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX days AFTER I expected a payment to post to my account. 

I then tried to set up bill pay with my new bank, XXXX XXXX, only BoA doesnt accept electronic payments through XXXX XXXX 

I then logged into my BoA account again, canceled and then reapplied XXXX and realized that it says ( in very small print, above the important details of DUE DATE ( which was indeed the due date on which I expected my payments to occur. ) The reasonable person probably not even have read this far. They would have seen that autopay was set up and never noticed a discrepancy until their next bill IF THEN ( since they already had it on autopay. ) This is clearly a petty scheme to exhaust/defraud BoA credit card customers who want to make timely payments but who are frustrated at every step by arbitrary barriers, insane limitations, and the excuse that you didnt read the fine print for requirements NO ONE ELSE has. This is predatory banking."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for two Credit Cards from two different Banks. Bank of america was seriously delayed so I called them. On the phone I was told I had a Freeze. I removed this a Few months back when I punched Land. the operator said I had a freeze but since she had me on the phone she said I can re-submit my application once again then put me on hold. So I got on my laptop to confirm if I was being lied too. I see on my laptop that I had not Freeze and that I was being lied too. The Bank assistant get beck on the phone and states '' Congrats you are approved for {$7000.00}. I told her wait! I just checked my Credit card Company that I placed a Frees on and Removed that Freeze and there is NO FREEZE! i said you lied to me! your Company lied to me. I said because you delayed my credit you had to lower my amount because as you can see XXXX XXXX gave me {$10000.00}. Because your company delayed my card and then used an excuse that I had a Freeze and as you can see this resubmission you did not mention on the then Siad because of your negligence I can not use you and do not want it. She then stated well, I have to read you these 4 things. I then just hung up. 
Well, I then get a letter from the Credit Card Company, Bank of America stating "" At my request they have cancelled my Application. A second lie, because it went beyond Application and is Approved for {$7000.00} and Bank Assistant stated! Then lied and said my income is insufficient. I applied for a loan just a week ago and was approved for {$50000.00}. Then Bank of america threw in another lie stating I was denied because of no deposit or investment balance. 
Remember the woman on the phone told me I was approved for {$7000.00}. and still continued to lie writing we make decisions with current economic situations etc., etc. They did not mention the reason was becasue they dragged their tails and then lied and said I had a Freeze to cover themselves. Then Approved me for a Lower Amount then spewed out lies to cover their tails! Have to make this short your system stated I must hurry up or be timed out!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America granted me a secured credit card in the past. After my credit did well the called me in 2019 and told me congrats your card has been upgraded. Bank of America then returned my security deposit leading me to believe its now unsecured. I was told to look at the website to see the perks bells and whistles. The website clearly states no annual fees. They are still charging me an annual fee. I have asked them why they said the don't know they should have sent me the "" New Terms '' but they will now after charging me Annual fee 's for the last 2yrs. I then asked them to direct me to where its available online of this secured fee, and the secured card they showed me has no annual fee. They purposely withheld the fee from plain view after upgrading nor send new terms. Upgrading card is misleading because it really was not."
Credit card or prepaid card,In XX/XX/XXXX my account was closed and my available funds were taken with out no notice or explanation. They flagged my account with little information on why they want to verify my identity which I have fax documents to XXXX I have called them numerous times with no help at all my benefits continue to be paid out every week but no destination to an active account. They don't want to resend me no new card. I'm left with silence and despair with no clear direction in resolving the issue I file complain towards bank of America and Arizona DES for partnership in this. I was able to verify DES has received my documents but held to reverse their actions.
Credit card or prepaid card,We have {$4800.00} of charges on our credit card account charged by XXXX XXXX within three days of one another. We have a XXXX  account but the monthly charges are only usually about {$100.00} per month.

Credit card or prepaid card,Called Bank of America on XX/XX/21 to inquire what types of hardship programs they available during covid 19 hardships. The only program they have is to defer ur payment for one month. They are not willing to work on lowering the interest rate or the minimum payment amount due and they dont have a 6 or 12 month program for hardship they have nothing except the one month payment deferral. Which makes it difficult to pay ur bill when u are in unemployed and still have not received any payments from the unemployment office because its Pa unemployment

We have spent many hours on the phone with different people. We finally gave a telephone application to re-open it several weeks ago and were told the card would be issued in 7-10 days. That time passed long ago. We have tried several of their phone numbers and can not reach a person. We have held for as long as an hour with no one answering. This has become disruptive to our business operations, as we are a small business."
Credit card or prepaid card,I had fraudulant charges on a bank of america credit card I had. I have disputed this numerous times with all 3 credit reporting agency 's. XXXX has finally received confirmation from bank of america to delete this account off my credit report and remove it. However XXXX and XXXX are still reporting it. All they are doing is sending me copies of my credit report stating the account has been updated and verified as mine. I contact corporate office for bank of america and it has been determined that these charges were fraudulant and I would not be liable. I was told to re-dispute and bank of america will respond to delete off my reports. Like I mentioned earlier XXXX has deleted it off my report but for some reason bank of america will not send the same information to XXXX and XXXX to remove off my report. I do not understand this as the response should be the same for all 3 credit reporting agency 's. I contacted free legal advise and was told that if bank of america has deleted this account off the report after my dispute the response should be the same for XXXX and XXXX. I have been dealing with this for months now and having this on my credit reports is affecting my credit score. I am being penalized for charges I did not do. To top this off I thought my balance last year was at zero I had no idea my card was being used fraudualntly.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021, my husband 's car window was broken, and the car was stolen/ driven away. My purse was inside which contained, among other items, my Bank of America credit card. As soon as I realized my credit card I had been stolen ( within a matter of hours ), I called Bank of America to shut down the card. During that phone call, the representative I spoke to asked if I had made a {$1400.00} charge at XXXX XXXX XXXX or a {$16.00} charge at XXXX XXXX. I told her no and said that was fraudulent. We also called the police and filed a police report. Bank of America also sent me an email around this time notifying me that there were suspicious charges on my account. I responded in that email that I had NOT made the charges and that they were fraudulent. On XX/XX/2021, these two charges were removed from my account/bill. However, shortly thereafter I received a letter in the mail indicating that my fraud claim had been denied, and by XX/XX/2021 these charges had been added back on. 

After receiving this letter, I called Bank of America to appeal the decision and understand why my claim had been denied. The person I spoke to said there had been a mix up because another charge ( that I did not identify as fraudulent ) had been marked as fraudulent. She said she would clear it up in the system and assured me the issue would be resolved. It was not. I received another letter with a denial. Again, I called back. This time I provided the police report number as additional evidence. Again, I was reassured the claim would be reopened and resolved. It was not. The charges continued to stay on my account. I called Bank of America several more times over the coming weeks, each time attempting to resolve the fraud claim. I received another letter on XX/XX/2021 from Bank of America indicating that my their "" decision to decline your fraud claim for this transactions ( s ) has not changed. '' The reason cited was, "" While you personally didn't make the charge ( s ), we confirmed it was made by an authorized user on the account or someone who had permission to use the account. '' This is false as the person who made the charges was a person who had stolen my credit card. 

After receiving this letter, I called Bank of America a fourth time regarding my claim on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX ( which was the second time I provided the police report number ). During this call, I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was told no supervisor was available. Then, I requested that the claim be escalated. The person I spoke to assured me that I would receive a callback within 24-48 hours because I had requested an escalation to the claim. I did NOT receive a follow-up call, so I called back a fifth time on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. The fraud person I spoke to this time claimed that the police report number had not been entered into the system ( despite the fact that I had provided this on two previous occasions ). He said that the claim would be reopened and within 1-2 days the charges would be taken off the account while the claim was under investigation. I provided the police report number for a third time and two employees I spoke to during the course of being transferred told me that they were filing an internal complaint. 

Today is Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. The charges are still on my account as they have been since XX/XX/2021. The claim is listed as closed on my online banking message center. I am exasperated as I have been trying to resolve this with the bank and have called the fraud department five times now over the past two months. Each time, I am promised a reopening of the claim and resolution, and each time Bank of America has done nothing to resolve it."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened my first credit card account on XXXX as an international  XX/XX/XXXX. I just realized they charged me {$39.00} annual fee for 6 years, for a {$0.00} annual fee credit card. I search online about BOA cash reward or BOA cash reward student DO NOT have annual fee. There is no valid reason for charging me {$39.00} per year for 6 years! If I did not notice this, I guess I'll still be charged the non-existing annual fee. My other friends do not have this problem. 

I noticed I have a {$39.00} annual fee charged on XX/XX/XXXX and I already called BOA on XX/XX/XXXX to waive the fee. What about my previous annual fees? I need my refund for the non-existing fee charged on me. This does not make any sense.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021, I purchased jewelry from XXXX that was advertised as XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was not. I have a letter from XXXX XXXX stating so. I started a claim with Bank of America ( the credit card issuing company ) for the return of my {$63.00} spent on this counterfeit product. After submitting some documents to the bank they issued me a credit for the above amount. Then the merchant submitted documents showing proof of delivery and the bank reversed my credit. The merchant 's submittal discussed nothing about the heart of the problem -- counterfeit product. The bank then sent correspondence to me asking for additional info. I did not respond to this request because the case numbers on their correspondence did not match up, so I concluded that the left hand of the bank did not know what the right hand of the bank had done. Then I got a letter from the bank saying the case was closed because of time and deadline issues. I have since sent documentation to the bank as well as discussing the matter on the phone but have received no satisfaction. I have tried to explain to them that the timelines imposed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act do no apply because this is not a billing error but rather an issue about quality of product. The people I have dealt with do not understand the legal significance of this. Please help"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I filed dispute with BofA against XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX for an amount of {$2400.00}. I provided over thirty pages of documentation supporting my dispute. I highlighted instances where XXXX personnel where confronted with lies, which were not denied, or challenged. XXXX agreed to complete the work needed ; however, because they were not trust worthy I expressed my desire for a credit to get the work done elsewhere. At this point, XXXX became disgruntled and cut off communications after accusing me of extortion. I informed BofA of XXXX despicable accusation and they informed me not to contact XXXX from that point on, which I complied. 

BofA claimed they hadnt received the required information by the XX/XX/XXXX deadline and closed the claim, even though the information was faxed to them on XX/XX/XXXX. Once I realized the claim had been closed I called them, they reopened the case and later applied a credit in XX/XX/XXXX. 

BofA once again closed the claim in XXXX of XXXX, claiming that information had not been forwarded ; however I never received any notification for additional information in the form of a letter, email, phone call, or text message. All I received was a notification that the case was closed. This is in stark contrast with the messages I received persistent text messages for an account balance that was under dispute, and rightfully should not be up for collection in XXXX of XXXX. 

I called and they reopened the case, but didnt remove the charge from my account. 
XX/XX/XXXX I forwarded the additional information requested and have yet to receive a response on my claim status after several follow ups with BofA via phone calls. I also requested details of BofAs dispute process : what has happened, what their procedures are to better understand what has happened to determine what actions theyve taken on my behalf to resolve this dispute. They have ignored these requests. 

XX/XX/XXXX, with only the disputed balance on my account, BofA started forwarding collection messages, even though the claim is still pending, and has been open for roughly six months. 

After receiving collections notices, I called my local branch to have them reach out to the disputes department about the collection efforts that I believed should not be happening. Disputes told local rep that the amount would be removed from my account and a letter would be sent notifying me of the credit while the investigation was pending. 

A week or so after receiving no letter, I called the dispute department. They informed me that the charge would not be removed and the dispute would be escalated. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I called BofA for a status update, only to hear that they will not do anything to escalate the resolution of the case, and will not remove the charge until the case is complete, even though it was their error why the charge was reapplied to the account."

I was transferred around and put on hold every time for 30 min. Nobody would help me try and fix the account. Nobody at Bank of America knows what they are doing. 
They had my address and information incorrect and thats why I never got a notice. But this debt is not valid and not mine. This account needs to be fixed because there is no way I am paying {$920.00} for nothing but their FEES!!!

They have denied my claim for five maybe six times and I have had it re-opened each time. A police report was requested which I then got and informed my bank of who the officer was where the precinct was phone number badge number. The officers that took the report said this had to be fraud I then informed my bank of the police report figuring that this would settle it. They denied me again so there wasnt enough evidence.

My detailed explanation from XX/XX/XXXX. 

Bank of America illegally and fraudulently withheld additional fees from me several times after my bank account was closed on a secured credit card that I opened and received from this bank in XXXX. Before closing my account in this bank regarding my secured credit card, I specified what balance I had on the date of closing the account, they called me a small amount that I paid at XXXX, after which my account was successfully closed. But after that, within a few weeks, I received a notification in my email that I had an outstanding balance. I also paid for it a second time. A little bit later, about a month later, I also received an email about the debt on my bank account, I had to close it a second time. After a little time, I found out about another debt on my account. I did not pay this debt for a long time, because I believed that this was a mistake, fraud and illegal. Then I called the bank itself several times, waited on the line for several hours and talked to different departments on the phone and explained this problem and the situation. Then I also went to the bank itself, where they opened this secured credit card for me in XXXX. I personally explained to the banker of this bank in this branch at the address : XXXX, New York, XXXX XXXX XXXX, exact address : Before closing my account in this bank regarding my secured credit card, I specified what balance I had on the date of closing the account, they called me a small amount that I paid at XXXX, after which my account was successfully closed.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I personally applied to a bank in New Jersey in person at a branch. The banker said that she does not see my credit card bank account at all, which was opened in XXXX. I opened a secured credit card in XXXX and Bank of America approved and issued this card to me and set a credit line of {$300.00}. And she's a branch banker at the Bank of America in New Jersey, XXXX XXXX , she can't help me. Then, together with this bank employee, we called the customer service phone number, on the phone I gave all the information about myself, and they also did not help me at all. They also don't see my information, such as my credit card account number. 

Warm Regards, XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"How are you doing? I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on both of my credit cards with you guys ; XXXX XXXX-30 Day Late payment. 

I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XXXX  I have filed a complaint against Bank of America for opening an unauthorized card in my name. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In the end, Bank of America admitted that the employee opened a card in my name without my permission as the recording showed that I declined on 5 different occasions. 

However, the supervisor had the card closed out at the credit XXXXXXXX XXXX with the false statement that client ( me ) requested the card to be closed, while i never ordered a card so that should have been closed out as Bank of America unauthorized opening a card in my name. That caused my credit score to drop down by XXXX points resulting in higher interest charge for a mortgage I was going to apply for and ended up not getting due to the additional cost. But i got a private loan instead. 

I have spent today almost 2.5 hours and have been transferred numerous times to the wrong department to see if I'm included in the compensation that Bank of America is ordered to pay out for unauthorized credit card and other wrong doings. 

Since even the 4th transfer was to the wrong department, I felt I have no other choice than to file a complaint as I don't have all day to try to speak to the right department. Please have Bank of America reach out to me. I have the complaints that were filed through this website on file, and they are showing that what I'm communicating is correct."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XX/XX/2019 I overpaid my Bank of America credit card account by {$27000.00}. On XXXX XXXX I discovered this and contacted B of A asking for a refund to my XXXX Bank account ( where the funds had originated ). I was told it would take 3 - 5 business days. On the 5th day I contacted B of A asking where was the refund. I was told it might really be 7 - 10 business days. Other phone calls have indicated it might be 10 - 14 or 14 - 21 days. I kept being told that the delay was because of the large amount of money involved. I have made at least six phone calls, all with lengthy time spent on "" hold. '' On XXXX XXXX I received a letter from B of A dated XXXX XXXX that stated that the funds had been transferred to my checking account. When the funds had not turned up by the 11th, I called and was told it may take several days to "" clear through your bank. '' My bank says they process immediately -- no delay. 
On XXXX XXXX the funds have still not been returned. Now I am told by a "" supervisor '' at B of A that they refund accounts using XXXX as the intermediary party and XXXX had been given the funds on the XXXX. Obviously the letter was false. 
Now they say 30 business days from the XXXX, meaning this could be the middle of XXXX. These are electronic transfers from bank to bank. I can not believe it could take over two months to move $ XXXX from B of A to XXXX. This is ridiculous and unethical, maybe illegal. 
The credit balance B of A held in my credit card account was far in excess of my balance owed, yet now they want to charge me late fees."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been trying to get a hold of Bank of America for 3 weeks to resolve fraudulent charges on my card. This card was never activated and the charges are identical in nature after three rounds of canceling and reissuing a card card. 
Charges are coming from XXXX. 

There must have been a massive data breach that was not shared with customers. 

I know of other people affected in the same way by Bank of America."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My long running autopay series was cancelled which lead to a late fee ( presumably interest charges ) accruing on my account even though this autopay series has been running for years. 

My Unlimited Cash Rewards card had an autopay series that was set up when it was originally a Merrill product. In early XXXX of this year I did a product change to the new Unlimited Cash product and my autopay payment series continued to run in XXXX and XXXX successfully. On my due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) no payment was applied, triggering the late fee etc. 
The only thing that I can imagine might be related is that I set up autopay for a separate account ( Customized Cash ) on or about XX/XX/XXXX but I don't understand how that would cancel my autopay on my Unlimited Cash ( formerly Merrill+ ) card. 

I talked with someone on chat who couldn't look up my autopay information. When I asked to be escalated to someone who could help they gave a phone number that dumped me into someone in banking who couldn't access my credit card account. When I asked for a warm handoff to a credit card agent they connected me somehow but then I got disconnected ( no call back ) from that agent partway through the discussion with them."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Contacted bank of america customer service via 1800 number on the back of my card on XXXX/XXXX/2017. was advised the transfer of funds from my credit card to my checking account would be effective within 2-5 business days. Time frame was not met, funds have still not been received. Called today at XXXX EST and spoke with a supervisor named XXXX, who advised me this would be available and fixed within no later than 2 days. Still seeking resolution and investigation. A refund was issued from a merchant, after my credit card statement was paid in full. Now my credit card has a credit of XXXX dollar balance, Which makes it difficult to use my credit card because my balance will be negative, meaning bank of america owes me money, and that will not reflect positively on my credit usage and credit utilization towards my credit score."
Credit card or prepaid card,"There was a police report submitted to Bank of America. A supplement was submitted too to Bank of America. Bank of America did not address the issue on fraud that which XXXX XXXX was a victim as indicated on the police report. Bank of America is not addressing the issue.

Bank of America is still sending monthly statement with extra charges on interest adding on. XXXX XXXX XXXX do not owe Bank of America any monies. XXXX XXXX CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT WITH BANK OF AMERICA WAS CLOSED MANY MONTHS AGO!!!!!!! 
Bank of America should reverse back the debit on XXXX XXXX credit card account back to XXXX XXXX Bank account wherein the payment was reversed. 
This had been an ongoing dispute XXXX XXXX have been complaining on this fraud with Bank of America. 
Bank of America had been asked to remove charges on XXXX XXXX billing and it seems it was not done and Bank of America refused to acknowledge her complaint.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I've been looking to make a big purchase ( engagement ring ) recently so I signed up for Bank of America 's Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card. 

I was approved on XX/XX/23 with a credit limit of {$16000.00}. I chose this card specifically because of the cards features listed here advertised to anyone by Bank of America {$200.00} in rewards for meeting a certain spending amount in 3 months 1.5 % unlimited cash back 18 months 0 % APR My card was shipped on XX/XX/23. I received the card and made a purchase for {$16000.00} ( the limit they gave me ) on XX/XX/23. I placed another {$5000.00} on another Bank of America card ( Customized Cash Rewards ). 

Then on XX/XX/23, I received a letter saying Bank of America was closing both my accounts for the following reasons ( Recent transaction activity on the accounts ) + ( Number of trades on my credit report ). 

As the only transaction that occured on my Unlimited Cash Rewards card was for my engagement ring that must have been what triggered the closure. 

The problem is they essentially pulled a {$600.00} bait and switch with their advertising. They promised the rewards as described for making certain purchases, approved my application and credit line, and now closed my accounts and refuse to provide the {$450.00} in rewards for me to use for the Unlimited Rewards Card. In addition they closed my Customized Cash Rewards card and refuse to let me use the $ XXXX rewards that I earned from using their card for this purchase and previous purchases. 

I contacted Bank of America on XX/XX/23 to log my complaint and a customer service manager named XXXX from Texas, requested reconsideration as he deemed it credible and reasonable. All I have from this complaint log is a ticket number from that date that I saved as a draft in my gmail account ( attached ). 

This can't be seen as gaming the system as I am accepting their advertised offer. I pay all my balances on time. I know Bank of America collects card swiping fees so how can they accept my purchases and bill me the balance without keeping their end of the bargain to provide the rewards as they offered? 

You can't have it both ways... profit off my choice to bank with Bank of America but refuse to provide rewards promised. I'd happily take my purchase elsewhere to another card company who honors their rewards as advertised."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I found out today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) via an email ( attached ) from Bank of America that it closed my credit card, one that I have had since XX/XX/XXXX. I called the Bank to find out why they closed my credit card and was transferred several times, before someone could respond. But, that person merely said it may have been due to primarily making minimum payments on my credit card ( but I also typically make large payments periodically throughout the year ) and also may be due to certain other "" metrics '' that didnt seem to pertain to me. He listed several possibilities, none of which applied to my historical credit patterns. I have not been late on this credit card or any other loan for years, except this month. I was three days late on the payment to the Bank of America credit card this month. The payment was due on the XXXX and I paid it on the XXXX ( it posted on the XXXX ) - a simple oversight that has not happened for years and would not have happened if Bank of America had an intuitive automatic payment system and if I wasnt in the process of moving. My current credit report shows a perfect payment history on this and my other credit cards and loans. Also, I am not maxed out on any of my credit cards I maintain less than 70 % average usage of my revolving debt. Ironically enough, I received a mortgage offer ( also attached ) from Bank of America just this morning, before I received the email that it closed my credit card account! My primary concerns are that this account closure, through no fault of my own, will hurt my good credit score, which I have worked hard to maintain, and that it will prevent me from obtaining credit at a fair interest rate going forward. As this is one of my oldest accounts, it is sure to have a major impact on my credit score. Lastly, I can not help but be concerned that this is an act of discrimination on the basis of my XXXX surname because I see no sound business reason for this action."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Had a credit card through Bank of America for probably a decade or more and my payment history was spectacular. Back in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, I paid off the full balance on the card. Apparently I did have 2-3 items that were monthly charges on the card and didn't realize it. When you sign up for paperless billing, you don't get anything mailed to you anymore. So I wasn't seeing an account statement email and those charges accrued for 2-3 months before I was notified by Bank of America that I had an overdue balance, around XX/XX/XXXX. I talked to an agent and asked him to send me the last 3 statements so I could make sure I got everything cancelled and told the agent I would pay the balance in full as soon as that was received. Those statements were never sent to the address I gave, and they moved my account into their collections department. I talked to an agent in that department on XX/XX/XXXX and told him I wanted to pay the balance in full and close the account. He told me he would waive the late fees, so instead of paying {$330.00}, I paid {$260.00} and got confirmation from the agent I was paid in full and my account would be closed so nothing else would charge to the account. Then, a week or so later, I get an emailed statement saying I still owed {$65.00}. I called BOA again. I asked them to review the call I had where I was told I would owe nothing else and my account would be closed. They just kept telling me that department didn't have the ability to review calls, asked them to send that request to the department that did. Just kept getting the run-around for the agent ( and manager ) I spoke with. I just wanted them to listen to the call and call me back and tell me if they thought I was treated fairly. Telling someone an account is paid in full and closed, then sending a bill for more money I believe would fall under both the FDCPA and UDAAP regulations. On top of everything, this financial institution has gotten so big, you can't even call them without getting transferred 2, 3, 4 times, placed on hold, using hours of your day to try to resolve an issue. It's almost like they want to make it so hard that people will just drop their complaints and just pay the bill, whether it is collected fairly or not."
Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America EDD debit card closed my card as I was right in the middle of transferring my funds to our other account not affiliated with bank BofA. I assume they did so because they did not want me to transfer my funds. loss of interest?? who knows what excuse they have. But they should be charged for doing this to me. What grounds do they have?? EDD is still depositing my unemployment benefits to my account that I have no access to. I have called t he number on the back of the card and gave them the correct answers to security questions. But was told I had to call back to talk to someone in the Fraud department and they gave me no number said to call same number XXXX and they would have to transfer me but they where closed right now. I have called numerous times and the transfer just goes right back to customer service after it rings numerous times.I at this point dont think there is a fraud department that they have to have me speak with its just a game to them. How do they close my account that I have had since XXXX ( EDD ). and right when i am about to transfer my funds they close it down within seconds of me doing so. How can they even say Fraud when the IRS took a lien on my account last month and took XXXX from my account there was no problem with Fraud obviously that should clear up any fraud issues.. i mean they had to verify me with the IRS 4 weeks ago. I can not get print out of my account as they have blocked me I can not use my card because they will not open my account I have even since changed my pin number through EDD and my security questioins where I had to answer old ones to change I thought that would indicate there is no fraud on my account. The only fraud going on here is by bank of america EDD. I am a retired correctional officer and have had prisoners do less crime then the ones Bank of America is getting away with .. I still have no new card and my card i have in my presence is still closed. nothing is getting done and I have done all I can do. HELP PLEASE XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX
Credit card or prepaid card,"I moved in the middle of XX/XX/XXXX and notified Bank of America ( I've had a Visa credit card for 30 years, originally issued by MBNA before it was acquired by Bank of America ) that I was moving and to update the new mailing address. I use the card monthly and do not run a balance. I had paid the XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX bill ( not due until XX/XX/XXXX ) a week ago. 

In mid XX/XX/XXXX I tried to use the card at two stores and it was declined. I called Bank of America today to find out if the card 's chip or the strip was bad. The first gentleman I spoke with ( in West Virginia ) was very professional and was as confused as me as to why the card was closed. He went through the payment history and could not determine why the card was closed. He then transferred me to another gentleman in Texas who was also unclear as to why the card would be closed and then he transferred me to another another person in the some other group within Bank of America. This group apparently has been around for about 5 years. They claim to have solicited me in one mailing in XXXX indicating they wanted some information they no longer had or they would cancel my card. They apparently solicited me again the week of XX/XX/XXXX by phone during working hours from a number I do not recognize and was possible spam. So instead of sending another notice when they should recognize that I am settled in my new home, the cancel the card without due notice. 30 years. Their own website indicates they will not solicit information. There is no indication of this pending cancellation on the most recent billing statement."

I had tried to use my card but they blocked the card for about 11 months..I just noticed that there was two transactions that got denied because of the block. Both transactions were for XXXX dollars. Stated it was submitted and payed out but I didn't get the money due to the card being blocked. I called and called Bank of America over and over just kept getting getting the card had been blocked and I needed to contact my sponsor. They have done this more than one occasion. I had contacted unemployment but they had me on a waiting list for 10 months. I couldn't even dispute the charges due to the fact that everytime I called they wouldn't even speak to me they would say contact my sponsor. I don't think this is right to take money that didn't get paid to me bacuse they blocked my card
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am a victim of EDD prepaid debit card of the Bank of America, and I have never been given my authorization to anyone to use my EDD card and account for purchases and withdrawals.

I had not charged anything else after paying the card off in XXXX. I called the company and asked them why/how they were charging me interest in XXXX after I paid everything that was owed in XXXX, and they said it was accrued interest.

Credit card or prepaid card,I have spoken with you guys before about this complaint against back of America I have found a claim with them on XXXX XXXX which they have changed my date to XXXX XXXX and the same day I filed the claim with them they placed XXXX  the claim money to my account in the negative and the reason why they said they did this is because they gave me a provisional credit but the reason why I file the claim because I didn't get a professional credit and also I asked them repeatedly for my bank statements they sent me a link which I couldn't get into at all so I called the number on the back of the card to receive the information that I was looking for and I ended up getting two white envelopes of mail that I wasn't supposed to get that proves that they're still using their automated for all filter that they blacked out my social security number in my name on the top of every paper they also falsify my paperwork that I sent to them and they use envelopes taking off my claim numbers off the top and put in there on two claims to my account that they wanted to use which one of them I didn't even file also and there was a letter that they claim came from CBPF I called cbpf and a informed me that that letter was not there letter they never written that letter. It's been a year now since I filed the claim with them it took them 11 months to get the XXXX  off of my account with the claims that they took for my account that they paid me but took it right back out of the XXXX  they had on my account in the negative. Then they sent me another card. And on this card was no money . I ordered four different bank statements and when I got them there was actually four different bank statements one was the 19 pages the first one the second one was 14 pages the third one was five pages and this one that I just received was only four pages they did things to my account without letting me know what was going on or nothing the only way I find out if I called him which I called

know what's going on with this bank but it's a lot of stuff going on with this paint that's not right and I have proof and I looked up most of the things I'm telling you about I have the paperwork to

Credit card or prepaid card,I was told by the counter teller that I should get a secured credit card through their bank ; Bank of America. The teller told me it was a XXXX Refundable deposit and after making a years worth of on time payments I would receive an unsecured credit card with a XXXX limit. I never received my deposit back or an unsecured credit card. I have made all payments on time and have never been late in over a year. When I asked about why I was told it was at their discretion ( Bank of America ) whom receives a refund of their deposit and an unsecured credit card. I was lied to.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Summary : While traveling abroad, I logged on to check my credit card statement almost immediately after the statement had been generated. I noticed several charges I did not make. I immediately made multiple attempts to contact the credit card company, by phone and through the web interface, but to no avail, over the next two days. When I arrived home a few days later, I was finally able to get someone on the phone, and filed the fraud report. Over a month later, the company decided against my claim, and reinstated the charges. No reason was given, though after speaking with someone on the phone I was given a nonsensical explanation that the fact I had logged on to my account so many times after the fraudulent charges indicated I was responsible. I explained that I logged on to the account so many times in an attempt to contact them. 


Details : XXXX XXXX : Shortly before leaving for a XXXX trip that evening, I logged on to my account through the credit card web portal to file a travel notification, so I could continue to use the card when traveling. ( travel-notice.pdf ) XXXX XXXX : While traveling in XXXX, I received a notification that my monthly statement was available. ( statement-notification.pdf ) XXXX XXXX ( and possibly XXXX XXXX ) : I logged on to my account to view the statement and recent transactions and noticed four charges I did not make : Transaction Date - Posting Date Description Reference Number Amount ================================= XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX {$500.00} * This charge was also credited back from the merchant in two credits of {$250.00} each on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX {$93.00} XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX {$2200.00} XXXX - XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$290.00} ( See XXXX and XXXX ) I immediately began making efforts to contact the credit card company and inform them of the fraud, and ask them to cancel the card. I tried calling various phone numbers on the card and listed on the web page, but always got only messages saying the center was closed. I tried various things through the web interface, including clicking on boxes next to the fraudulent items which said "" report this as fraud ''. 

XXXX XXXX : I flew to XXXX. After arriving that evening, and continuing into the morning of XXXX XXXX, I continued trying to contact the company, to no avail. I made repeated phone calls but could never get a person, only messages. I sent a note through one of their web interfaces for contacting them. Something I did did result in freezing the card -- on XXXX XXXX I received an email from them ( XXXX  ) asking me to contact them immediately (! ) and indicating a hold would be placed on my card. I wrote back explaining I had been trying repeatedly to contact them but no one would answer the phone ( XXXX ). 

XXXX XXXX : I arrived back in the U.S. in the evening. 

XXXX XXXX : I called the credit card company and this time was able to get someone on the phone ( XXXX, see XXXX ). I explained the whole situation to her. We went over all the charges. We discussed that the {$500.00} had already been reimbursed. A fraud claim was filed. 
Shortly after, I received a credit on my statement for all four charges ( including the one for {$500.00}, which wasn't necessary ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a fraud claim letter explaining that {$3100.00} was credited to my account as the invesitgation proceeded ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : I received a letter indicating the credits for {$500.00} would be reversed since the merchant already credited me. 
( Which was correct, and which I pointed out at the beginning when I made the claim. XXXX ) XXXX XXXX : I received a letter saying "" We've received your dispute regarding our decision on the fraud claim for the above account. Our decision hasn't changed ... '' ( XXXX ) But I was never informed of any decision, and I never disputed anything. 

All of the fradulent charges were reinstated on my account. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After several attempts, I was finally able to get someone on the phone to speak about this. I asked ( 1 ) why I was never informed of a decision, and ( 2 ) why this decision was made. 
I was told the "" wrong letter '' had been sent to me, but there were notes regarding the basis of the decision. These amounted to something like this : because I had logged on to my account many times after the fradulent charges were made, and did not "" display urgency '', they decided I was responsible for the charges. I said that the reason I had logged on to my account so many times was because I was trying urgently to contact them, to no avail. I was told the investigation would be re-opened, but so far no action has been taken and the charges still have not been reversed. 

Given the way the company has handled the situation so far, I have no faith they will do anything about it. I have spent many hours communicating and trying to communicate with them about this situation. 
I did everything right, and promptly. I am not supposed to be liable for charges I did not make. It should not have taken this long to resolve the situation ( and it is still not resolved )."
Credit card or prepaid card,"After at least 15 on-time Autopay payments ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) in an amount well beyond the minimum, Autopay was disabled without prompting or request by me, despite having no updates to the linked account and having sufficient funds available. This resulted in a reported delinquency by Bank of America to both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX effectively damaging my credit score by 102 points. Furthermore, Bank of America used this failure in their own system to justify a reduction in available credit for this account, potentially impacting my score and purchasing power additionally. 

Bank of America is unable to explain why Autopay was disabled and has no record of any request to disable it. In addition, Bank of America refuses to provide customer confirmation of issues reported or actions agreed to via phone assistance via email. No issue or reference numbers are provided and associates in this case promise to "" escalate '' the issue but provide no definition of what escalation involves and no record of any action take could be produced or referenced in later correspondence. 

I am also not receiving e-statements or payment confirmations from Bank of America as requested. No evidence of Bank of America correspondence in spam/junk folders but they have my correct address as I received their notification regarding a reduction in available credit."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was offered a secured line of credit with Bank of America. I was asked to pay a deposit of {$200.00}, was told that after a few months, usually 6 months of good payment history, I would get an increase on my credit limit, and that after 12 months, I would get my deposit back. Neither of these promises took place, instead, Bank of America closed my credit line without any previous notice and has never returned my {$200.00} deposit and my payment history is/was excellent. The line of credit has been closed for a few months now and I have yet to received my {$200.00} deposit."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXX my wife lost my credit card when she went out for shopping and someone picked it up and spent almost XXXX dollars in different stores. I called bank of America and reported the fraud charges. The agent said I could rest assure that I wouldn't be responsible for the fraudulent charges. However the issue is still not fully resolved as of today. 

I called bank of america at least 5 times. I provided every transaction details and also the police report that I filed. ( I filed it 30 days after the card was lost because the first bank of america agent said it is not necessary. However the second time I contacted bofa another agent says it would be helpful and that was 3 weeks after first contact. Then the credit amount back to my account was never correct so I have to call bofa several times. Every time the agent promised they will take care of everything. The most recent date that I contacted bank of america was on XX/XX/XXXX because there was still XXXX dollar credit hadn't been added to my account. The agent worked for at least half an hour and promised this will be resolved. Then I did get an letter saying they credit XXXX dollar to my account. However I never see that credit on my statement or shown in any transactions. Then I called again in XX/XX/XXXX asking about this. The agent looked through my account and couldn't see the credit either and said that it may take 3 months so could be in XX/XX/XXXX. Now it is in XXXX already I still didn't see the credit and I just feel very disappointed after I wasted so much time. So I think filing this through CFPB may help to get this resolved. I have been using BofA cards for many years and never late for payment and I was happy with the card until this time."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I saw in the news about bofa getting penalized for issues including mine, which was the alaska airlines promotional miles spending requirement for miles. I spent many phone calls, emails, and even had my financial advisor with Merrill Lynch, a bofa company, to help with no resolution, not even a partial awarding of reward miles. 

In XX/XX/2018 I signed up for the card. The night I researched, I was finding two offers-one had a XXXX spend requirement with XXXX bonus miles, the other XXXX spend requirement XXXX bonus miles. When I went to apply I could only get the XXXX to go through, and I noted that XXXX needed to be spent. I ended up spending about XXXX in the first 3 months and noticed 4-5 months later I never got miles. I emailed bofa to inquire and got a denial. Then, I called and spend 2 hours going back and forth between bofa and alaska with no solution. The biggest issue I had was that nobody could provide evidence of the spending requirement I had signed for. They said I was supposed to have XXXX spent but my statements and any documents in my account did not provide information about that. 

I went back and found that in XX/XX/2018 that transitioned the promotional offer from the XXXX miles, XXXX requirement to the XXXX miles, XXXX requirement. Even the lady from bofa I spoke with agreed that their system and coordination with alaska was glitchy and there was a chance that their system auto-booted me to the other promo offer on their end, but with no notification or information of me to be aware of this. 

The fact there was no proof of what my spending requirement was had me so frustrated. None of the papers sent in the mail had it either. It felt incredibly unfair to KNOW i signed the XXXX requirement, XXXX bonus online and spent XXXX shy of the XXXX they claimed I needed to ... and not even a partial awarding or small token was given. mind you, also being a preferred bofa member with merrill lynch I was shocked to be dismissed without consideration. 

I never got ONE bonus mile to my account after all of my investigating, calling etc. They couldn't provide evidence of the signed document I supposedly had and none of my statements showed progress toward the spending minimum. This felt shady, deceptive and non-transparent. Clearly, nearly 5 years later I'm still bitter and feel slighted by this situation. I've continued keeping this card the last 5 years because of it flying to my hometown, the free bags and companion fare and have racked up XXXX of my own miles in that time. 

Back then I was not able to login and find my original account documents and today I am also unable. The lack of clear communication/information is concerning, especially considering that I am a type A person, financially literate and I can only imagine the mess people get in that are not as savvy in situations like this."
Credit card or prepaid card,I have a recurrent monthly charge being placed on a Bank of America credit card from XXXX  for {$19.00}. This has occurred for 3 years.

I then immediately followed up with a letter written to Bank of America Dispute Resolution Service on XXXX/XXXX/201 outlining my phone conversation as well as indicating I am disputing the charge on my California EDD benefits debit card. 

Bank of America issued a letter stating they reviewed my base and concluded the decision was correct. 

Bank of America did not outline how this decision was made and did not provide any back up documents or corroborating evidence the transaction was mine. 

Please be aware. I reside in California and did not make, authorize, approve or request someone else to complete a transaction at a vendor in XXXX, Arizona."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I reported fraudulent activity on my visa credit card with Bank America. There were two fraudulent charges made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX at the same location in amount of {$39.00}. I filed a claim with Bank of America and they denied the claim with no explanation other than saying I have too many accounts with this pizza place, which makes no sense. I contacted them again and they said they'd have to file an appeal it would be another 45-90 days. In the meantime while I'm waiting for appeal, they added the two charges back into my account which is continue to accrue interest. Please help me with these fraudulent charges and unfair treatment from Bank of America"
Credit card or prepaid card,So I have a account with bank of america. I noticed I had a bunch of charges that I never heard of an small to large amounts. An it would be like 6 big amount charges in 1 day. Then a few little charges. Then on another date a cluster of big charges. All from XXXX an something called afterpay. These are NOT my charges. It's fraud. Its obvious it's fraud. After researching online. This is a common scam. My bank knows this is fraud. But yet. They denied my claim
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XX/XX/2023 I paid off the balance on my Bank of America Visa credit card and inadvertently overpaid the balance. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a refund for the overpayment. First a representative named XXXX who refused to identify herself further behaved in an abrasive and rude manner denying me the refund i would be entitled to. Upon waiting an inordinate amount of time on a second call I spoke with XXXX XXXX ( if that is really his identification ) who insisted that if I did indeed require a refund it would take 14 days. He could not explain why I could not have my money returned within a reasonable amount of time like 24-48 hours eventhough I have held accounts there for 30 years and pay monthly fees of {$25.00} throughout that time period. I maintain I deserve prompt access to my own funds and asked what if I went to a branch requesting this money or even if I closed this account where the balance would have to be returned to me. He insisted that there was no way I could get around a minimum of 14 days and it wouldnt make a difference who I spoke with whether I maintained my accounts with BoA or not. I contend that this is fraud and it is gross mishandling/mismanagement of my money against my wishes. I wish for this to be a formal complaint against the bank and its personnel assuming they will vouch for these people. How do I get MY MONEY that is currently essentially stolen as it is being held for no reason against my wishes, back?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"on prior pages of complaint form I could not find the right questions regarding my problem so chose the closest to my issues. 
here is my problem. 
on XX/XX/2021 my XXXX Bank of america depit cart was hacked and all my money, in the amount of {$4800.00}, was stolen. I filed a police report and file a claim with BofA several times during the year, but BofA was keep denying my claim, I filed with fraud department also, they keep asking me to identify and verify my identity few times, which I did, first time went to bank and verified my ID and signature and second time I faxed them my ID. Every time I filed a complaint they denied my claim, saying "" unfortunately we're unable to approve your recent claim '' saying that I took and transferred money to my checking/saving account. I have several checking and saving accounts with Bank of America, if they do detailed investigations they will find out that I did not deposit or transfer any money during that time and amount of {$4800.00}. that money was my XXXX money, my only income during covid because losing my job. 
thanks hope you will be able to solve this issue."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Between XXXX XXXX I filed for Unemployment Insurance Benefits through the California EDD website, and certified my unemployment each week. I began working in XX/XX/XXXX, and stopped filing for Unemployment Benefits. I changed addresses on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a California tax form stating Unemployment Benefits had been paid. I began looking, and found that my Unemployment Benefits were retroactively paid on XX/XX/XXXX, and a Bank of America Prepaid Visa Debit card was issued to my old address on XX/XX/XXXX with a balance of {$5300.00}. I discovered that {$5300.00} of fraudulent charges and debits had processed against the card, and only a {$15.00} balance remained. I was unaware that any payments had been issued or that a card had been issued and used. 

I immediately opened a Bank of America Prepaid Claim on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. After several reconsiderations, Bank of America is still denying my claim. I have provided two separate Police Reports and numerous statements. I have also identified two suspects from ATM transactional photos provided by Bank of America as supporting documentation. I requested the most recent supporting documents from Bank of America, and received a package including deposit, debit, and balance statements ; everything I could get online. The package did not contain a reason for the denial of my claim, so I have nothing to argued against for reconsideration. 

Any reasonable person can associate the timelines and deduce that I was not aware payments were issued, a card had been issued, and the card had been activated and used prior to receiving the tax documents on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I have provided Bank of America ample documentation and evidence to pursue their investigation and agreed to cooperate and testify in any proceedings. Bank of America has no reason to deny my claim, and should immediately reimburse the {$5300.00} to my account."
Credit card or prepaid card,"When I opened my XXXX  XXXX credit card back in 2016, Bank of America set up my account in such a way that I did not have administrative access to all of my authorized users. Whenever I would make a payment to the corporate account, the payment would appear as a credit on my personal card, and would not apply to my authorized user 's outstanding balance. This caused my authorized account to accrue late fees and interest. When I asked customer service how to resolve the problem, they told me that I had to make separate payments to the authorized user 's card and did not advise me on how to create an online profile that allowed me to access and pay each card 's bill. This frustrating experience led me to curtail usage of my BoA business card. 

In this year, my online access was locked unexpectedly in XXXX. I called the customer support number provided on the website but was never able to get through to an agent. Since my account had a {$0.00} balance, I decided not to pursue the problem any further. However, when my annual fee was charged, I was unable to log in to pay the bill or cancel the card. Although the annual fee was the only charge on the card, my account was marked as delinquent for nonpayment. I called and paid the annual fee and requested that the account be credited for the fees, due to the IT issues and the fact that the only outstanding balance was the annual fee itself. Now one week later, I received a call that my personal and business accounts are being closed because of a late annual fee payment. 

Based on my poor experience with Bank of America 's business products and IT,  my personal account is being affected. I am requesting that the business and personal accounts be marked as customer-closed due to Bank of America 's poor treatment of a customer who otherwise has a 800+ credit score and no derogatory marks on my account. I personally regret not closing the accounts myself since I moved all of my business spending to a friendlier bank and am suffering at the hands of a dormant account."
Credit card or prepaid card,yes XXXX XXXX useing my ssi information for this credit card fraud on my credit report address u need contact her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I called to report to Bank of America that my wallet had been stolen and that two of their bank branches had allowed the thief to fraudulently withdraw cash advances of {$150.00}, {$4800.00} and {$1000.00} against my account. In addition to the cash advances, Bank of America had changed me bank fees for each transaction for an amount of {$10.00}, {$240.00} and {$50.00} respectively. 

I called to report to Bank of America that my wallet had been stolen and that two of their bank branches had allowed the thief to fraudulently take out the cash advances against my account. A claim was setup and the bank refunded the fraudulent cash advances and fees. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was notified by Bank of America that my fraud claim had been denied and the original cash advances ( {$5900.00} in total ) were charged back to my account. The bank fees that were originally charged for these fees were not charged back to me after this denial. I found out through a later conversation with a representative from the BOA Fraud Department that this denial was most likely caused due to a clerical error from the person that setup the initial fraud claim. Apparently they failed to mark that my card had been stolen. I fought this denial via phone call and certified letter and requested all evidence used to review the claim as is my right per the XXXX. I wanted this evidence to add to the case that I had filed with the XXXX PD. To this date I have received no evidence from the bank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that Bank of America had applied an interest charge of {$11.00} against the fraudulent cash advances. 

The fraud claim was eventually honored on XX/XX/XXXX after I officially disputed the denial via multiple phone calls and a certified letter that they received on XX/XX/XXXX. 
After honoring the claim, Bank of America reversed the {$5900.00} in cash advances yet again. On this same date, they also returned {$300.00} in bank fees that they did not owe me since they had not charged me for them after denying my original claim. They did not, however, reverse the {$11.00} of interest charges that they applied on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted Bank of America via phone call ( sometime between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) to inform them that they had refunded me for {$300.00} worth of bank fees over 3 transactions that they did not owe. I also asked them to remove the {$11.00} of interest fees. The representative informed me that the bank would automatically true up the fee refund and the interest within about 3 weeks. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that Bank of America had incorrectly issues 3 additional bank fee adjustments crediting the account yet another {$300.00} over XXXX transactions. This compounded the original issue described in the previous paragraph bringing the total refund overage to {$600.00}. I called again with the next day or so to inform Bank of America of their second error and was again told to wait and that it would be resolved. By the time I received my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement my account balance still remained at - {$580.00} XXXX {$600.00} of erroneous fee refunds less the {$11.00} of interest that I did not owe ). 

In XXXX of XXXX, nothing seemed to be moving. I had made multiple calls to the fraud department to try to reach a resolution on these issues but I just received constant canned responses. The account balance remained the same. The interest charge remained and the incorrect fee reversals remained. I scheduled a meeting with my local Bank of America branch to see if sitting across the desk from someone might help bring resolution to the issue. My in-person meeting was held on XX/XX/XXXX at the XXXX branch in XXXX, WA. The representative I met with reviewed the issue and understood my problem but ultimately just put me on the phone with the same fraud department that had been incapable of finding a resolution to these issues for months. The representative I spoke with on the phone promised me that the interest would be credited and the extra charges would be reversed very soon. No time frame was provided. 

At the end of XXXX Bank of America mailed me a tax statement ( FORM XXXX ) reporting to the XXXX  that I had income of {$600.00} due to these refunded fees that were credited in error. This created a tax situation form me that should not have existed. 

By the XX/XX/XXXX statement there had been no change from the XXXX statement. The account still showed a final balance of - {$580.00} and I felt that I was no closer to resolving the problem. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that the Bank of America XXXX Department had decided to start taking action the issues that I had been bringing to their attention for months. I noticed that there were XXXX charges applied to cover a portion of the extra fees that had been sitting in the account. This covered {$300.00} of the {$600.00} that I had asked them to take back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I found that a second round of duplicate fee charge backs had been applied to the account. This should have been the end of the fee charge backs but instead Bank of America continued to create new issues for me. 

After charging back the duplicate fee returns on XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America proceeded to then hit me with a new round of bank fees. I found that there were XXXX new transactions that populated after they had finally fixed the original fee issue. This put me {$300.00} in fraudulent debt yet again, taking me all the way back to the position I was in in XXXX. These fees should have never been applied and still remain to this day. I called the Bank of America Fraud Department and explained this to their representative on XX/XX/XXXX. He told me that this issue would be resolved in 3-5 days. As of XX/XX/XXXX it is still not resolved. 

Because Bank of America decided to charge back the duplicate fees before reversing the {$11.00} interest charge that they have forced me to carry since XX/XX/XXXX and that they have repeatedly promised to fix but haven't, the interest hit my account as 60+ days delinquent. The extra credit returns that had sat on the account for months had shielded this from happening but the second they reversed those fees their system decided to start dinging me. The worst of this is that they reported this to all XXXX credit bureaus as delinquent, which dropped my FICO score 109 points in a single day. I had already been hit by 30 points back in XXXX when they denied my initial claim and charged the cash advances back to my account. To date, they have trashed my credit score by around 139 points and it continues to decline. 

To date they are showing that I owe {$300.00} in bank fees and {$11.00} in interest charge on fraudulent cash advances when I have a letter from them stating that they honored the fraud claim back on XX/XX/XXXX and would credit me back for "" any interest charges and fees that you were charged ''. I have contacted them 25-30 times via phone, sent 2 certified letters and have met in-person at a local branch. Bank of America has shown that they have no interest in clearing up this issue. 

I have attached the letter honoring the claim, a detailed breakdown of what has transpired since the theft in XX/XX/XXXX and labeled bank statements from XXXX through XXXX that correspond to the details laid out in the breakdown letter. 

This data proves that the bank has been negligent in their responsibilities to me as a cardholder as per the requirements laid out the the XXXX."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. After removing the XXXX, and months of determining what the best course of action was for my health, I decided to undergo XXXX. I started my treatment in early XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX ( XXXX I believe ) XXXX. 

I filed for state XXXX insurance. According to the CA XXXX website, via my account, I was informed I would receive my first payment {$2200.00} on early XXXX XXXX and second payment of {$1400.00} mid XX/XX/XXXX. 

I waited but never received my debit card in the mail. It was until around the first few days of XXXX that I saw a news segment on TV where people reported their unemployment and XXXX money had been stolen via fraud. Immediately I that is when I decided to look further and based on my research I was led to call Bank of America. 

It was at this moment that a bank rep informed me that was issued a card and that there were transactions posted. I denied all transactions and made a claim that I never received the card. Then I had to go back and forth with CA state XXXX department and Bank of America to determine who I needed to work with to get my money back. No one gave me an answer until it was determined that I needed to work with Bank of America. 

Fast forward until today, XXXX year later XX/XX/XXXX, I have not used a single penny of those funds and have been getting my claim denied by Bank of America. I have called plenty of times requesting funds to be issued due to personal hardships. I have filed a police report and sent it to them. I have send them documents proving my identification. A social security document and pay stubs to prove my identity. But to no avail. 

Their findings to dismiss my claim seem absurd. They state that the transactions and atm withdrawals are geographically near me. I've been fighting back requesting the footage and evidence of them determine that I made this transactions. They keep telling me that they are sending in a request but I have not received any of this. I do not know what else to do. Please I hope you are able to help resolve this issue. Much appreciated."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2022 I received an email from Bank of America advising that they sent a query to XXXX for my credit rating to process a credit card I never requested. I checked my account with XXXX and Bank of America did, in fact, send a query about my credit rating. I was then sent a follow up email from Bank of America ( BofA ) advising that the credit card ( a XXXX card ), which I never requested, was being approved. I contacted BofA customer service by telephone and advised them that I never requested this credit card and that I wanted it to be stopped. I was advised this would be taken care of. On XX/XX/2022 said credit card arrived in the mail. I did not activate this credit card. On XX/XX/2022 I went to a local BofA branch and requested a branch manager call their Fraud Unit and cancel the credit card. While at this branch office of BofA I also spoke with the person in their Fraud Unit and she advised that the credit card was canceled ( I never activated it ). At this time I am waiting for a confirmation letter from BofA advising that the credit card was canceled."

Credit card or prepaid card,"My EDD unemployment debit card, issued by Bank of America Prepaid was frauded over a month ago. I submitted a fraud claim and they keep denying it. It initially took almost a week just to submit the claim because the bank computers were down! I have tried to escalate but it is very difficult to get in touch with any managers. Please call me back as soon as possible with a resolution. The amount frauded was almost {$800.00} and it was over a month ago that I filed the claim! It's a lot of money for someone that is on unemployemnt. I also want you to know that I did my own investigation and found 3 charges on the same day to XXXX for {$140.00} and I called their fraud department. They told me that it was done with a digital card at a gas pump in XXXX, CA. They have the pictures from the camera and the video. Bank of America said that they keep on denying me because of the use of a chipped card. That is not true because I called XXXX and they said it was a digital card. In addition, they also overdrew the prepaid card, which is impossible to do, unless this is an inside job at Bank of Americal So not only am I loosing on the fraud but they also took future benefit payments on this STUPID card. Please help!!!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America credit card statement had a New Balance Total of {$4400.00} with a Minimum Payment Due of {$44.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a {$4700.00} balance transfer from my BoA account to my XXXX XXXX account. The transfer posted to my BoA account on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had autopay setup through BoA 's bill pay system, and it autodrafted my previous account balance of {$4400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This meant my XX/XX/XXXX BoA statement had a New Balance Total of - {$4300.00} with a Minimum Payment Due of {$0.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. The Important Messages section on Page 4 of the statement clearly says "" You have a credit balance and do not need to make a payment on your account. '' I did not routinely check my BoA account or bank account after verifying the balance transfer had posted, so when I noticed this draft from my bank account I was very upset and called BoA. They indicated they had no control over the e-bill system and didn't know what had happened. I requested they refund the payment, which they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX. I verified the money was back in my bank account and didn't think anything else needed to be done. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to use my BoA card online and it was denied. When I logged into my account, it showed my account was past due and that I had missed a payment. I double checked my XXXX statement and verified it showed {$0.00} minimum payment due by XX/XX/XXXX. At this point I was very upset, so rather than call BoA I used their online chat system. I believe the representative I dealt with was XXXX. She initially said I'd missed a payment, then after 30 minutes of back and forth explaining the situation to her, she credited the {$25.00} missed payment fee, and said she had fixed the account. 

I assumed the issue was taken care of until I tried to use my card online today and it was once again denied. This time I called BoA and had to go through the whole scenario again. The first rep explained that I'd missed a payment in XXXX that was caused by BoA refunding my XXXX payment. I explained my XXXX statement shows there is {$0.00} due so there was no way I could have missed a payment. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor. The supervisor looked at the account, noted that the {$25.00} had been credited on XX/XX/XXXX, but then said I should have made a minimum payment in XXXX and that there was nothing she could do about it other than take a payment today. I once again pointed out the XXXX statement and she told me that you have to make a payment every month, which is ludicrous."
Credit card or prepaid card,I am having a tough time with Bank of America prepaid Edd card. I paid for something with the card that I saw on XXXX that cost {$170.00} which was a projector with the screen. I noticed almost immediately something was fishy with the company at because when I made the purchase and then was emailed the receipt it had a different company name on there. There was no phone number for the business and I immediately emailed my concerns. After sending several emails and waiting a couple weeks with no response other than your product is on the way I then sent several emails for a refund to no response. I emailed their XXXX page demanding a refund and still no response. So then I called Bank of America and told them what was going on and filed a claim. I was given a provisional credit in XXXX I believe. To this day I still never heard from that company or received what I ordered but today I noticed that Bank of America took the {$170.00} back out of my account. When I called they told me the claims department is closed and there is no supervisor to speak to because they are working from Home. Thats truly pathetic. Not to mention she couldnt give me any information as to why this money was taken back from me. I NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THaT COMPANY. I tried to go on there supposed website today and its all fraudulent. Site is not working and says domain name is not purchased. So why in the XXXX am I out of {$170.00} on a fraudulent company that scammed me and now Bank of America is supporting that scam by taking my money. I thought they were FDIC insures for things like this. I dont have money like that to throw away. Im collecting unemployment for Christ sakes.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I just got a new Master credit card ending with XXXX with Bank of America. 
Their record show my XXXX credit score is XXXX out of XXXX. But they gave me 24.99 %. 
My cousin has also the same credit card few days ago. He got 22.99 % with a credit score of XXXX. I called Bank of America, and ask them why my rate is 24.99 % with XXXX XXXX score while my cousin get 22.99 % with XXXX XXXX? 
They could not answer my question."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : XX/XX/2018 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me, or the payment was not applied as fast as expected. I checked my bank account and noticed that you deducted the money out of my checking account that on the month that you marked me late on my credit report."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to use my B of A card to make a purchase at XXXX XXXX for close to {$70.00}. The card was only authorized for just over a dollar. I told the cashier, that cant be right because I had just received my UI benefits payment a couple days earlier of nearly {$700.00}. She attempted to run again with same outcome. I used another form of payment, and went straight to my car and investigated. I logged onto my BofA account to see that a couple days prior someone had used an ATM to check the balance on the card, then proceeded to drain {$700.00} out at one time, reducing my balance to just over {$30.00}. ( I got {$30.00} of gas on the way to XXXX XXXX completely unaware of what had transpired. I immediately called the number on the card and B of A transferred me to claims where I was disconnected. I called back, and was able to speak to someone who told me that they were sending a replacement card in 2 days, and I was able to file a claim. They said in 10 days I would receive some important paperwork that I needed to immediately fill out and return. I was upset, but relieved that a claim was in process. In a little more than 10 days, I received a letter informing me my case was closed. Then began my frustrating attempt at getting any information about why my case was closed. I have always used a nice demeanor, and been patient with the agents, but have either been denied access to info on my claim, been accidentally disconnected many times, and on my 6th call, they asked for my phone number as they said they didnt have it on file. ( I provided it during initial claim ) 8th call a lady said she put what was called a freeze tracker on my account and that it should have been placed on my account in beginning. I have notes written all over my claim closure letter, as well as a recording of one of the agents one of the several times they told me that XXXX was responsible for the freeze. I called XXXX a total of 3 times throughout the process because B of A said it was their fault. Each time XXXX told me it wasnt them and that they know they are talking to me, my XXXX account is open and fully functional, and that B of A is the one who needs to lift the freeze. I have been passed back and forth like a tennis ball wasting literal hours and days on the phone on hold or trying to get through. 
I should tell you also, I immediately called XXXX after I initially called B of A to report to them that my card had been compromised. I switched to paper checks as I dont trust the card, and have since received a check for my continuing benefits. I am all good with XXXX, its Bank of America that is the problem. 
My last call so far was yesterday where the agent again told me my account was still frozen and there is no estimate on when it will be taken care of. 
I am beyond frustrated as I have been finding story after horror story of the same thing happening to people and their money being tied up in B of A for upwards of 6 months or more. I cant afford to wait that long for {$700.00} .. it may be little to some but its a lot to me. I dont think B of A should be able to continue to get away with these practices that are absolutely leaving their customers in a terrible lurch. The agents are lying to the customers, diverting them away to buy time, and doing many other extremely, in my opinion unethical things to avoid paying claims. It was my money.. I was the only one who had knowledge of my PIN number and my card has never left my wallet. I dont even know how someone had a copy of card and the pin. I need help and I think this company should pay for what they are doing to people. I will continue to receive my benefits in paper check form and never patronize B of A for any banking services as they are dishonest and fraudulent in their own right."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX, XX/XX/2022 Reference case no. XXXX Bank of America, N.A. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX  Card Balance Transfer Funds Dispute From XXXX Credit Card ending in XXXX Bank of America XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Tx XXXX According to the accompanying evidence, Bank of America has been notified of the situation detailed below, issuing an unsatisfactory response under the reference indicated above, when the events described below : On XX/XX/2022, I made through XXXX with its XXXX XXXX XXXX product, a credit card under my name whos last XXXX digits are XXXX, a transfer of the balance on my Bank of America credit card in the amount of {$5400.00}. 

According to the XXXX account statement for the month of XXXX, dated XX/XX/2022, the charge corresponding to the total amount of {$5600.00} is reflected, broken down as follows : {$5400.00} for the balance transferred from Bank of America plus {$270.00} for a transfer Fee in accordance with the offer granted to me as its owner. 

However, due to an error in the numbering of the account under which XXXX made the payment of the funds to Bank of America ( to the wrong number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), which is why presumably the payment of the balance corresponding to my credit card account XXXX Bank of America ending in XXXX. ( Correct number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) - After notifying XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America, I received a response communication from them under reference No. XXXX on XX/XX/2022, where they indicate verbatim : We would like to inform you that the payment was made with an invalid account number and the payment was rejected and returned to the originating account However, they do not report any electronic reference that attests to the completion of such return to the original account. 

As verified by the Account XXXX for the month of XXXX from XXXX corresponding to my credit card that ends in XXXX, the balance of the transfer of funds made to Bank of America still does not reflect the refund mentioned by that institution. 

After receiving the response from Bank of America and observing that XXXX did not reflect the return of the transfer amount, I addressed a claim to XXXX requesting a rectification. I have received a response from XXXX on this dispute on XX/XX/2022, under case No. XXXX, for which they specifically report the following : We do not observe that Bank of America has XXXX the balance transfer funds to us. You will need to contact Bank of America to apply for the credit. 

In such a situation, it is evident that Bank of America has not presented me with an efficient electronic or physical proof that shows the definitive return of the amount paid by XXXX, nor the crediting of the amount to my correct credit card account number ending in XXXX. 

It should be noted that, from XX/XX/XXXX to the present date, XXXX ( XXXX ) months or XXXX ( XXXX ) calendar days have elapsed without Bank of America showing that it has returned the funds that it acknowledges having received in a non-existent account from XXXX has not credited the amount in my correct account that ends in XXXX to which the funds were actually directed in order to cancel the balance of the aforementioned credit card. 

However, as reflected on my credit card statements ending in XXXX from Bank of America, I have been charged interest on the principal balance due XXXX Charges per fee {$28.00} Interest {$90.00} XXXX Interest {$100.00} XXXX Charges per fee {$39.00} Interest {$98.00} Now, since more than 60 days have passed without Bank of America resolving the aforementioned return of the amount to XXXX or crediting the transferred balance to my correct account ending in XXXX, despite being notified and having exhausted all means to solve in my capacity as a user and account holder, making Bank of America fully aware of the facts, such a situation has directly harmed me not only in the amount of money that is missing in my account, but it has also created damages in lost opportunities and payments of bills that my family depended on. I now present a debit balance on both accounts for the same amount, despite having done everything possible to resolve this situation. 

Therefore, I proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Consumer Protection laws of the State of XXXX, namely, the Deceptive Trade Practices Act ( I enclose the proof of my due diligence as a consumer before the CFBP ) and the Code of XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( agreements ), XXXX and XXXX, which protects consumers against harmful conduct by banks, to be by urging Bank of America XXXX have a return check issued for funds sent by XXXX XXXX to my credit card without further delay, sparing me further damages generated so far due to its omission or failing that, showing evidence of having already done so. 

You are hereby further advised that this letter also constitutes the filing of our client 's claims against you under Chapter XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and other potentially applicable laws that subject you to additional liability for attorneys ' fees incurred in connection with our client 's claim.

Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXX, two instances of identity theft occured : 1 ) A fraudulent unemployment claim was made in my name to the California EDD and 2 ) My BofA EDD Debit card was hacked and the address and identifying information was changed making it impossible for me to gain access and control of the account. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have attempted to resolve these issues through multiple calls, emails, faxes, and on line submissions, and have not been successful. I reached out to my local representative XXXX XXXX for assistance who open a case with EDD. The EDD then called XX/XX/XXXX to advise me that the UI Claim has been flagged as fraudulent and denied, and recommend that I reach out to you to assist with closing my BofA EDD Debit card account.

Bof A has informed me that they can not close the account because of the {$900.00} balance that was deposited by the EDD as part of the fraudulent UI claim, and they can't send the {$900.00} back to EDD. The EDD has instructed me to have you help me close the BoA account and then I can send the {$900.00} to EDD Benefit Recovery."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I contacted Bank of America is see what options they had available regarding my credit card with them. I am struggling financially. I reviewed all the statements from XXXX to XXXX and came up with the following numbers. I only used the card for emergencies when I didn't have the funds for necessities for my family/child care/car repair. I spent XXXX total charges in XXXX on my BOA credit card. I made XXXX in payments in XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. Late fees and interest charged by BOA totaled XXXX. My charges, late fees and interest totaled XXXX. Payments totaled XXXX. Leaving XXXX yet I still have a balance on my credit card statement of XXXX as of today. From XXXX dating back to XX/XX/XXXX I used my card one time in XX/XX/XXXX for groceries. All other chares in that time frame are late fees and interest charged and payments from me. I spoke to XXXX from BOA on XXXX to see if there was anything to do as far as stopping the late fees and interest and closing the account so I could then be on a payment plan to pay off the credit card. Seems like every time I make a payment there is a new charge from the bank so my payment gets washed out. XXXX then said she could transfer me to the collections department in which XXXX XXXX answered the call. She first stated this is an attempt to collect a debt on a past due balance of my card in which my card is current and the next payment due is XX/XX/XXXX. I asked why she made that statement because my card is not past due and the next payment isn't due until XX/XX/XXXX and she said I have to say that to everyone. I then asked her if there was any options in getting help so I can get the balance on my card paid off and she said no. She was very unpleasant to speak to, rude and unprofessional. I then asked to speak to a manager. She left me on hold for 30 minutes after which I hung up because I had to get back to work."
Credit card or prepaid card,My complaints involves not being able to get contact with the second tier level customer service representative to help me get my account unfrozen since about 3 weeks ago. Initially I complained in mid XXXX about a {$600.00} charge to my unemployment that I did not make myself. So I was sent a replacement card and the former cancelled. Then about 2 weeks ago I try to pay my rent and my card was declined. I was told to call EDD to verify funds were still goin 2 account and afterwards notify BofA of said approval. And they were. Bof A then told me that my account was under investigation and frozen until they conclude their end of this ordeal. As it stands today I'm still without funds to survive. Then every time I get on the phone I'm either met with the runaround or just disconnected from the phone all together after waiting several several minutes to hours. I just want to get my account unfrozen so I have access to my money and I can pay for my basic needs i.e. food and rent. I was initially told at first 24 to 48 hours by a representative and then it turned into several weeks that I was told to potentially wait to get my account unfrozen. if you could assist I appreciate that thank you
Credit card or prepaid card,"Since the beginning of XXXX I have been collecting unemployment through the EDD.  Every time I go to withdraw money my account is locked or restricted. When this happens I have to call customer service to have it unlocked. It almost feels like I have to ask permission to access my funds every time I need access to them. XXXX, XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX., I tried making a withdrawal of {$300.00} from this account only to find that it is restricted again. I got in contact with customer service where the first CSR who spoke with me. She mentioned that there is no reason why my card should be locked or restricted and transferred me to the fraud department. While giving my information to this department they transferred me unexpectedly in the middle of a sentence to a department that is not open and was disconnected from the phone call. I called back and was told by a second CS are that there is no reason why my account should be locked. The debit card I have is new and hasn't been used and this is the first time I am using this card. They then connected me to the fraud department again where they said they can not do anything and I must call the closed Department that I was originally transferred to where the phone call disconnected tomorrow morning at XXXX XXXX. eastern standard time. I need access to these funds because of an emergency and have to take someone to the hospital. If this person dies because of this reason it's going to destroy me. What they are doing is unfair, unprofessional, and I'm pretty sure its illegal. I called back a third time where a third CSR told me there is no reason why my account should be locked and I should have all access to my funds. He then said that there is nothing that they can do on their side and transferred me to fraud again where the person I spoke with did not say anything or do anything and hung up on me. At no point did I use profanity or slander the individuals I spoke to but I did profess that I was upset with this situation. I even told them that this is an emergency and need access to my funds. Even my online account can not be accessed and they won't tell me why. I am in fear for this person who needs a doctor and I am extremely upset that the banking system feels they have the right to do this to me. I would like to press charges to the fullest extent of the law to make sure that this banking institution doesn't do this to another person again."

Credit card or prepaid card,"The fraudulent billings on my Bank of America Mastercard XXXX came to my attention on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX after review of the prior year 's Bank of America charge card statements for XXXX. The review was done to gather information to prepare my federal tax return for XXXX. 
These fraudulent billings to this credit card all had one thing in common - XXXX ( merchants name ) '. After researching these items with a call to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, it became clear they were billed from a rogue account. This account had been opened by a relative of one of my employees. This employee had been hired a few years earlier to help me manage my sole proprietor business. I provide eye care services and products. 

I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, with the list of fraudulent billings from this rogue account per XXXX fraud department. Bank of America 's fraud department closed the account, and issued a new credit card XXXX. They investigated the matter. They agreed, and found all the fraudulent billings. They issued credits of {$68000.00}. I agreed this was correct, and they closed the case - per letter from Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX. 

I had also filed a report with the XXXX Police Department on XX/XX/XXXX. The report # XXXX was investigated by Detective XXXX. He did confirm the XXXX account is fraudulent after issuing subpoenas. The fraud case is ongoing against those involved as other issues arose from this investigation. All this information had been given to Bank of America. 

Surprisingly, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of America charging back /denying all my credits. This letter stated the merchant ( fraudster ) reported I received product and had a subscription that was delivered to my address. Again, I called Bank of America to complain the fraudulent billings were unauthorized. They had been paid by my accounting staff at the time ( rogue employee ) with billings from her relative 's rogue XXXX account. 

I wrote a letter on XXXX XXXX to Bank of America in reply. However, they denied my request. Thus, I closed the Bank of America account ending XXXX. I have not paid any of the fraud charges to date. Thus, my credit score was ruined since Bank of America reported this. They continue to refuse to issue back unauthorized billing credits. 

I believe XXXX had a reponsibility in detecting fraudulent activity, and the opening of this rogue account. If their systems detected numerous billings going out of this rogue account to just my Bank of America account -- it could have been prevented. Bank of America should have contacted Bank of America to confirm this account was indeed fraudulent -- as the XXXX Police Department found through subpoenas. 

I also believe Bank of America should adhere to their written policy in not having consumers be responsible to pay for fraudulent billings. If they investigated the matter thoroughly by contacting XXXX, this matter would have been resolved correclty. 

In summary, I have exhausted all other avenues to have my Bank of America account credited back appropriately. I now hope to have CFPB to investigate this matter to apply back credits due to fraud."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a revolving ( last four of the account number was XXXX ) and checking account with Bank of America back in XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I noticed drafts from my checking account in the amount of {$650.00} being taken for the past 10 months. I contacted Bank of America for further information and was informed that they were for a Life Insurance policy. I never gave authorization for such policy. I requested a copy of the  authorization and they indicated they did not have it. I demanded a refunded and they refused. They drafted {$6500.00} from my checking account total without authorization and then refused to refund their mistake. I had always kept on top of my financial obligations but was furious when they basically told me they could do what they wanted and that there was nothing I could do. At that point I closed the credit card and felt they had already taken the money that was owed to that card. I even told them that they by law owe me a refund because I never at any point gave authorization for any life insurance policy, they can take the money they owed me and pay off the credit card. That 's money I would have used to pay the balance had they not taken it!. They refused and I even had my attorney offer an additional {$1200.00} to release any and all claims BOA or it 's successors may have against me, which would have total more than what the balance was. That would have been {$6500.00} ( they owed me ) plus the {$1200.00}, giving them {$7700.00} to resolve the issue and remove it off my credit report. Just because they are a huge bank they should n't be able to get away with stealing and that is exactly what I feel this is. I have been fighting this issue since XXXX. If there is anything you can do to help me I would truly appreciate it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a credit card online, i was not sent a letter telling me i was denied. I called the company bank of america. The auto service told me i was denied. XX/XX/2023 I got a letter. This is clearly discrimination and breaking of the laws 15 usc 1611, 15 usc 1640 and 1691e. I would just like to let you know this company has denied a consumer the right to extend my credit, which is clearly something they cant do under the ECOA."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a credit card that was declined for a prior delinquency that I never knew existed. I sent written communication about my issue, and they just sent the same notification back with no new information, so I filed a complaint. After filing the complaint, I was contacted by a representative who informed me that I had charged off a business credit card account with them. 

It turns out that on the day that I closed my business account in XX/XX/2020, another purchase posted to my account from a XXXX subscription. I could no longer access my online banking at that time because B of A removes it from your login once you close the account, and so I never saw that I had a bill due. I never received a statement in the mail either. So I never knew this charge existed. 

I called the recovery department, who said they could not waive the fees and interest and let me pay off the single charge from XXXX, so I asked ot talk to a specialist. The specialist asked for the business address, and when I gave it to her, she said it was incorrect. So that means B of A had the wrong address on file for the business, which further proves that I could not receive any of these statements. 

On that call after she would not agree I had given the correct address, she goes "" one sec ... '' and then transferred me to an international commercial credit rep who had no idea what was going on or how to help me. Basically this woman refused to help me and just sent me down another IVR rabbit hole. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

This was a fluke timing issue where they posted a transaction after my account was closed and never told me about it. I just want to pay for that transaction and move on. There is no way I am paying months of interest and fees on a transaction that I never knew about. I have never missed a payment in my entire life on any card from any lender, and you can see that on my credit report that was pulled for my recent card application."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2023, I noticed an unauthorized charge of {$980.00} on my Bank of America account ending in XXXX. I promptly reported the fraudulent transaction to Bank of America 's customer service, providing all the necessary details, and was given a claim number XXXX. After their investigation, Bank of America denied my fraud claim, stating insufficient evidence to support my claim or another reason that I believe is not justified. 

I have reviewed my account statements and can confirm that I did not authorize this transaction. I have also taken appropriate security measures to protect my account, such as updating my online banking password and monitoring my account for further suspicious activity. Despite my efforts, Bank of America has not provided a satisfactory resolution to my issue. 

I am filing this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to request a thorough investigation into my denied fraud claim and to seek assistance in recovering the lost amount of {$980.00}. I believe the bank 's decision to deny my claim is unjust and request that they reconsider their decision and credit the amount back to my account.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a credit card with Bank of America. In XXXX of XXXX, I mistakenly made 2 payments to my credit card. I called the bank and asked them to reverse the second payment. It took the bank 3 months to reverse the payment. In the meantime, my credit card statements in XXXX and XXXX were negative ( because of the XXXX overpayment ). In XXXX, when the XXXX XXXX payment made in error was finally reversed, it was backdated to XXXX ( per the bank, as if that 2nd payment made in error in XXXX had never happened ), and because of that, the bank is now arguing that I missed the XXXX and XXXX payments, even though they acknowledge that those two statements were negative, and that there was no payment for me to make in XXXX or XXXX. Without notice, they closed my account, sent me to their collections department, and reported me to the credit bureau. My credit score has dropped by XXXX points."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been unsuccessfully trying to dispute ALL these fraud charges for over a year since XXXX when i first inquired about these charges with Bank of America to XXXX starting the dispute. I have been a victim of identity theft and its effecting my business, banking relationship, and cash flow tremendously because im still making payments and on the hook for charges I didnt do. My cards were stolen and its been plenty of charges made that i am paying for to remain current client with BOA that I didnt do. Everytime we do an investigation the problem is BOA 's fraud department can only look back one year so the majority of charges are not even seen by rep anymore. Also when i first started this dispute the charges could be seen but you have to wait 90 days for an answer on disputes and its no inbound calls to this department to sort out so here i am another year later still disputing this because I cant talk to anyone in department. All the fraud has been removed from previous disputes on same matter and charges have been ruled fraud that they could see and investigate but the issue is the charges started in XXXX and they are not able to be seen now by representatives. When i started this dispute the charges werent properly input so I had to wait 90 days and dispute again, so then even less charges were able to be seen from the past. This is why im reaching out I tried to resolve with the merchants but i cant resolve because i cant get information on account I didnt create to authenticate the charges all i can do is prove they were done on my card. Literally every transaction they investigated has been deemed fraud and that i didnt do it and its been adjusted on my account from my previous disputes about this same matter except the charges from past in XXXX the representatives cant see anymore.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Back in XXXX, I made a transfer payment from XXXX XXXX credit card to my Bank of America credit card ending in XXXX in the amount of {$3800.00} and my original balance was {$4000.00}. Which I should have been left with {$200.00}. The {$200.00} was paid before XX/XX/2020. At this this time I was not owing any balance. A week later i saw on my statement stating i was again owing over {$4000.00}. I went to a local Bank Of America branch here in XXXX Florida to make a complain and I explained my situation to a Banker and I was told BOA didn't receive any amount that I should call XXXX bank. I went to XXXX local branch to find out why the money was not sent and they said it was sent to BOA and they received it. I ended up telling XXXX to retrieve the {$3800.00} back and i will just pay directly to BOA. So i started paying to BOA from {$3800.00}, i continued my payment till it was {$3300.00}. Two days later, i saw my online banking stating, I was now owing over {$7000.00} from BOA. I do understand I was owing them {$3300.00}. I was really confused why they said I was owing {$4000.00} again. So, I decided to make another bank transfer from XXXX credit card in the amount of {$3300.00} to BOA to avoid the interest promo given to me. To my understanding, I shouldn't be owing BOA any amount. So, the {$4000.00} i believe was a mistake. I contacted BOA and told them about the mistake but there was no clear understanding. I am in need of help because I can't afford to give out any money I don't owe."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I attempted to setup autopay for a fixed amount, which Bank of America 's website says is possible. It is not possible, and you have to call BoA to figure that out.

Credit card or prepaid card,"on XX/XX/2022 I had submitted a complaint regarding Bank of America Business Credit Card Application # XXXX being denied. That CFPB complaint number was XXXX. This bank now has attacked me personally by closing out my personal credit card ending in XXXX through retaliation due to the prior CFPB complaint done on XX/XX/2022. The reason ( s ) listed are bogus and are a cover up just to cover up thier XXXX from any litigation or lawsuit. Its pretty obvious that this bank has retaliated in an effort to "" get back at me "" for the previous complaint. In regards to retaliation, Bank of America has been sued by many consumers and previous employees for employment and credit retaliation. This is public record. Bank of America needs to be investigated for this illegal act. I am going to take legal action against the Bank because I have had enough of thier XXXX. Please note, I am going to purse for {$5.00} million in damages that are unethical and demand my credit card be re-opened with the same credit limit. I further will sue you for an additional {$1.00} million due to the negative impact your going to leave on my credit report. It will show a closed account done by the credit grantor. Your not going to start damaging my credit score, and credit report with your nonsense. You had no valid reasons to close my account.

Customer service asked me to bring my ID to the branch to unfreeze the credit card. However, I am currently suffering from XXXX and I can not walk until I receive adequate treatment. Therefore I am unable to go to the branch. However, I can upload my ID, green card, passport, etc. to Bank of America to verify my identity. I currently have balances on two credit cards with BOA that I still need to pay and I don't want my credit score to be damaged next month. Please help me out with this solution."
Credit card or prepaid card,I set up auto pay with Bank of America. Their website shows that autopay is on but doesn't draft the payment. This is a deceptive practice to confuse customers.
Credit card or prepaid card,"This is regarding my bank of america credit card. The payment was set to auto pay ... the selected payment option was as follows : You're automatically sending payments for your bank of america personal card e-bill Deliver by : on the due date Pay : statement balance Limit : {$300.00} The bill was not paid. I am told that the above setting is that the bill should ONLY be paid if the statement balance is less than {$300.00}. My interpretation is that this would be autopayed up to {$300.00} of the statement balance. 

This needs to be clarified as it seems to be a system for generating fees for Bank of America and headaches for consumers. 

Further, if you adjust the auto bill pay, they apparently do not implement the changes for a period of time determined by them and not shared with the consumer. 

Every other bank I deal with is fully transparent as to what will be paid and by when. 

I view the above as deceptive practices."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My nephew XXXX XXXX opened an account with a credit card in my name from the Bank of America.

I called on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and was told by there customer service representative "" the payment will post on Tuesday '' it did not and I was charged a late fee. I called customer service again and spent 45 minutes on the call and was informed that the auto payment did not process and since I did not pay on time the promotional interest was cancelled and the balance on the credit card would be charged a default rate which is considerably higher than the promo rate.I now have to transfer the balance of the credit card to a higher interest rate credit card. I attempted in good faith to meet my requirement set fourth by Bank of America and and was mistreated due to an error on there part"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My name is XXXX XXXX, I have been a customer with Bank of America for over 14 years, I have never been late on any of my accounts with Bank of America or any of my banking relationships. In XXXX of XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of America indicating that the bank was taking adverse action my account ending in XXXX due items reported to a credit agency. I was alarmed because I was unaware of any delinquency that might have been present on any of my accounts. 

I immediately researched my account and identified that my XXXX which I set to a fixed amount of {$150.00} which was above the minimum amount due to the lack of an option within the bank to choose minimum + an additional amount as allowed at other banking institutions to allow customers to pay the minimum and add an additional amount so that minimum is always covered. I performed a balance transfer, and did not recall that the fixed amount was set might be below the new minimum payment. 

The XXXX continued in the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX at an the amount of {$150.00} which was initially {$28.00} dollars below the amount due. We received no notification from Bank of America that the autopay was not set to cover the minimum amount due. During the course of the period Bank of America assessed fees totaling {$140.00} and the first mailed letter we received was a letter indicating that my credit line was lowered from {$20000.00} to {$18000.00}. My other account was lowered from {$7000.00} to {$2800.00} ( Account ending in XXXX ) and subsequently our other account ending in XXXX that did not have a balance was later closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I subsequently checked my credit report and I identified that I was reporting as past due on my account ending in XXXX which deeply hurt me as a customer as I had was not aware that the payment was not covering at least the minimum due. 

Upon receipt of the letter we immediately made a payment of {$500.00} to fix the payment error. I then called Bank of America customer service and spoke to several staff and managers within customers service and the credit analyst team that were unwilling assist with me any reasonable resolution to the errors that were made on my account and the lack of notification. 

Bank of America did not take the proper steps to notify the customer that the account was past due, collected fees that were due an unfair, deceptive payment process where customers are not provided targeted notice of past due accounts, and customers who elect to setup automated payments for amounts greater than the minimum payment are penalized for doing so. 

The practice of not providing an option for customers desiring to pay down accounts sooner creates an opportunity for the bank to profit off of customers because it encourages customers to stick with minimum payments in opposition to adding additional to pay down balances. As the above was not indicative of the an intentional non-payment but rather an lack of an appropriate option provided to the customer, and the lack of notification of Bank of Americas part, the negative credit reporting and subsequent lowering credit limits associated accounts was not appropriate, and I am requesting that the negative reporting be removed as it was an unfair and deceptive practice by the bank and as a 14 year customer that was not experiencing a hardship of a sort that always pays more than the minimum."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened an account with Bank of America in XX/XX/XXXX. I had recently started my new business within a year ( XX/XX/XXXX ) of opening an account with BOA. I was provided a business credit card and a personal credit card which when looking at the statement, it combined the 2 cards with providing the credit card balances and the total credit limit. I mistakingly made payments to the business credit card verses the personal credit card account which led to a 30 day late. I called BOA to explain that it was an oversight on my part and I immediately paid what was due for my personal card. I verbally asked if this could be forgiven as the statement was confusing. The said they would submit a request for it to be removed. I made several phone calls since that time and have rejected my request for removal from my credit report. I have an excellent record of paying on time.It is now causing me a financial hardship for my new business as it is driving down my credit score and lenders are refusinf to consider me for a loan because of the 30 day late on my 3 credit reports. BOA refunded me the {$29.00} late fee with ease. The time frame is from XX/XX/XXXX to the current month of XX/XX/XXXX. I am uploading documents I have available.

In early XX/XX/XXXX I got a credit notice of a new account opened. I immediately called BoA to report this account as fraud. I was told it would be closed and an investigation started. Subsequently, I was sent a credit card. I also received a bill with an annual charge. After many failed attempts to get the annual fee for the fraudulent account removed, I was forced to pay the {$75.00} annual fee or they would charge late fees and report late payments to the credit reporting agencies. 

BoA has refused to send me a copy of the application ( which I believe does not exist ) and will not remove their charge that I never agreed to. I have spent hours on the phone and their tactic is to continually transfer you to someone else that still can not help you. They have taken {$75.00} from me and hold my excellent credit score as hostage. I was actually asked in my most recent call, Were you made aware of this from a notification from XXXX? Seems this isnt an isolated incident. What can I do to get this resolved?"

Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/2018, I came home from a Spring Break vacation with my kids to find my wife had moved out and filed for divorce. Her lobster lifestyle on our baked beans budget and job layoff had led me to over utilize four of my credit cards ( XXXX XXXX, Bank of America [ BoA ], XXXX, and XXXX ). I contacted each of them to discuss my problems and see if there was anything I could do. XXXX offered a temporary reduced rate and monthly payment. XXXX also offered a temporary reduced monthly payment. XXXX didn't have anything to offer. BoA suggested I open a new account with them to take advantage of available credit and shuffle some high-balance accounts around to promotional balances. Although I was initially skeptical of this approach, I was desperate not to get into an even worse situation and agreed. I was disappointed that the best they could do was a second account with a {$2200.00} limit but went ahead and transferred {$2000.00} to this account. What ensued led to significant impacts to my credit that I believe are still affecting me today. Rather than simply open a new account for me with this new line of credit like the rep had explained, BoA took the {$2200.00} off of the credit limit for my existing account. This basically put my debt to credit ratio for that account at 100 % and led to a domino effect across the other cards as they saw BoA drop my limit. My available credit for the XXXX card dropped from {$25000.00} in XX/XX/2018 down to {$21000.00} in XX/XX/2018, which not only put that account 's debt to credit ratio at almost 100 %, but also cancelled out a balance transfer request that I had just submitted. I spent a considerable amount of time complaining to XXXX and BoA about these issues and trying to describe what happened but they didn't seem to care. I'm wondering if the BoA reps get an incentive for opening new accounts and if that motivated them to push me in that direction. I'm trying to get a home equity loan to address all this horrible credit card debt but can't do so because of these issues with my credit. I've been very disappointed with BoA and regret ever doing business with them."

-Company said they would send out another one and I would receive in 7 days.

- They said they would send out a new card but that they were deducuting {$5.00} for the new card and it would come off of my {$150.00} balance. 

This is wrong in so many ways. I spoke to XXXX XXXX a supervisor ) who would not adjust that fee. To charge a customer another {$5.00} fee when we have not been able to use the card in the first place is not right! I feel like this company is fraudulent. If I had trusted that a new card was being sent out and didn't keep my old card for reference they told me they wouldn't be able to help me. Are they doing this on purpose. Are they making cards inactive for the customer to call in and then hope they threw the inactive card away where now they have no way of tracking what is happening with the new card sent out? Something is not right with this. To charge me another {$5.00} and for us to now have to wait another XXXX days to get the card is not ok. I feel like I will be making another call as this card ( which is now less than {$150.00} to cover the new {$5.00} ) probably won't show up either. This needs to be investigated!"

Bank of America verified there was no proof I authorize this amount or received goods or services. 

However, Bank of America refused to reversed this charge because they said Visa regulations would not allow the reversal because I had simply "" presented '' my card-even though I did not authorize this amount or received goods or services.

I was told that any payment made in excess of the minimum payment due is applied to the balance with the higher interest rate. There are XXXX balance transfer offers that I took advantage of.

Further in order to pay off the XX/XX/XXXX balance of {$1900.00} I would need to pay the {$3000.00} balance due XX/XX/XXXX. For a total due of {$4900.00}, in less than 2 months. The credit card has always been paid every 2 weeks so has never been late, and all payments have been in excess of the minimum balance so that I meet my obligation to pay off the balance transfer the B of A offered. Yet B of A refuses to allocate my payments as requested so that I will now be charged approx. 30 % interest on a balance transfer of {$3000.00} made XX/XX/XXXX."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I was approved on XXXX 2017 for Bank of America credit card and it worked perfectly fine for two full billing cycles. 

Lo and behold automatically on Sunday which was yesterday my first transaction did not go through in the morning. I got a email asking me if I attempt is the transaction. I responded yes and then my card work. 

I need to clarify one thing I am currently XXXX years old and XXXX sick and not able to leave my house and I have no problem providing all my medical records upon request. 

I gave my son the credit card to use as it states in the terms and conditions that I am responsible for payment even allow somebody to use it, which means that I have ability to allow somebody to use it. 

However after 16 phone calls which I have all the phone calls are recorded which will be provided upon request or in court in front of the grand jury. They discriminated and they told me I am not sure of the I gave my son the credit card to use as it states in the terms and conditions that I am responsible for payment even allow somebody to use it, which means that I have ability to allow somebody to use it. 

However after 16 phone calls which I have all the phone calls recorded which will be provided upon request or in court in front of the grand jury. They discriminated and they told me I am not XXXX XXXX. 
From the 16 phone calls, Eight representatives, were able to help me and they took off the restriction on my account and the account worked until it stopped after one or two transactions. 

I would like to make something very clear, my account ending in XXXX they put a restriction on my account which I am not able to use it and I am not able to make payments to it. Which is currently still in open status and its reporting already a late payment on my credit report. 
Now Im specifically complaining about the account ending in XXXX, which they are telling me on the phone they restricted account because they are not able to verify my identity and I need to go into a banking center in order to verify my identity and then they will remove the restriction. 

I would like to make something very clear, last time I had my home attendant take me to a banking center which was a huge hassle when the doctor told me not to leave my house and the banking centers told me theres nothing I can do and they gave me a number to call in. 

When I called in that number and I have everything recorded they told me that theres nothing they can do I need to go to banking center. 

For the record I would like to make where I am no longer going to a banking center, the main reason is I am not able To go due to my health condition I way over XXXX pounds Im XXXX years old you can contact my physicians if you want I get full consent for them to release my health condition. And the second reason is I did go already and they told me theres nothing they can do. 

I would also like for the record to add something which I find very interesting. It is very interesting how they were able to approve me for the credit cards, then they were able to verify who I am every time I made a payment, and even I had for two months one of my accounts restricted due to not being able to verify my identity they still had my other account open, this is all from the same financial institution which believes that I am not what I say I am, but the one account they allow open and the other one not. 

As we stand now and as Im putting in this complaint. I currently have two credit cards one of them they restricted two months ago which currently has a balance of close to {$5000.00}, and although I explained them several times that I 'm not able "" as much as I want to go to a XXXX XXXX '' I did not even ask them to allow me to use the card. All I ask them whats the give me the ability to make payments online and pay off the account in full, but they would not let me, and due to that they ruined my credit as I already have 2 late payments reporting on my credit report. 

Now they decided to restrict my other credit the card ending in XXXX which has a balance of approximately {$15000.00}, And besides the fact they abused me and discriminated on every single phone call which I have recorded. And the reason its recorded it is because there is no way Bank of America will get away with it without the fair trial in federal court, and due to the fact I live in New York the law gives me the right to record it as long as one party is aware of it. 
But now I am not able to make payments to this account as well. Nevertheless I am not able to use the account because all of the sudden they are not able to verify my identity over the phone, which I find interesting because they were perfectly able to verify my identity when I applied for the credit card and they were perfectly able to verify it yesterday when I called 16 times, actually only eight representatives were helpful and took all the restriction. And they were perfectly able to verify my identity when I had my line of credit with Bank of America. 

So basically heres how it works, I am not able to use my account ( s ) because they are not able to verify my identity, the reason they are not able to verify my identity is for two reasons, the first reason I was told is they can not tell me why, the second reason is because nobody in Bank of America is trained how to handle this and in fact they know very well and they know it even better than me that there is absolutely nothing they can not verify. ( The reason is very simple because, every time they wanted to verify my identity they send me an email with a code which I have to provide them, and then make me hang up and they call me back on a verifiable number ). 


In other words for final outcome by definition is that Bank of America as we speak does not believe that I am who I say I am which has its consequences."

I called BofA and was told that there is a new exclusion that you can not make the balance transfer check out to yourself. If this new rule was included in the offer letter, it was not clear or obvious at all. I have always made the balance transfer checks out to myself, deposited the check into my checking account and subsequently made payment to whatever account I needed to pay off. I have done this many times, but suddenly, they change the rules without making it clear. Very misleading ... and a financial burden.

After talking to the bank for almost 20 hrs, the bank admits it as an accounting error ( 3rd time ) and assured me this will be reversed.

Bank Reversed the charges that were duplicates but did not provide me the original credit of ( - {$53.00} ) even after they admit the mistake to date. I am frustrated, stressed, and gave up on the bank process as no one listens. I even escalated to the CEO of the bank."

Bank of America said that since the pin was somehow used, even though I was in another state, that I would have to pay the charge. I closed my account and paid the charge. 

I thought that it was the end of it, but on XX/XX/XXXX I was charged for the charges made in XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX XXXX after they had initially taken those charges off my account. Although I was in XXXX XXXX on those days, it his more than 200 miles from XXXX XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been struggling with Bill Pay issues with Bank of America since the beginning of XX/XX/2018. This Bill Pay issue, which is some type of error in their backend system, prevents me from getting eBills, and subsequently from setting up any type of automatic payment. This affects my current credit card and I have had to make manual payments to my credit card bills for all this time. The issue seems to have stemmed from me opening a Bank of America checking account, which apparently transfers my other account information into a different backend system than when I only had a credit card. This is when the issues started. When I closed my checking account to try to resolve it, the issue remained.

I have called Bank of America and utilized secure messaging a ton of times now to try to resolve the issue, and each time they tell me they have it handled, but I'd have to wait until the next billing cycle for it to resolve itself. The next billing cycle comes, and the issue is still not resolved and I can still not setup automatic payments for my credit card.

Obviously, it's in Bank of America 's best interest financially for me to not have automatic payments, as it would mean fees and interest for their revenue, and I'm wondering if they're not doing this on purpose because I can't imagine any tech support team being this incompetent in that after 8+ months, they still can't resolve the issue."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/XXXX : I was laid off on XX/XX/XXXX ( and still am ), a month later banks were still closed due to Covid-19 SIP. At that time, the only way I could pay basic living expenses from my existing XXXX account was by electronic funds transfer ( which I had never done before ) from my Government Benefits account. I transferred {$1300.00} of Unemployment & CARES Act funds from my prepaid BofA account to a Chase account owned by me - well, I thought I did. ( Note : BofA disclosure limitation says transfers are only allowed "" to account owned by you '' ) XX/XX/XXXX : Transfer not received, called my bank for status. XXXX Rep helped me identify the error - I had incorrectly entered my SSN instead of my account number. XXXX advised me to call BofA to report the mistake and ask them to recall or reverse the transaction if it wasn't automatically kicked back during validation / Called BofA, spoke with claims Dept, reported the error, and all details, explained the mistake was an incorrect account number, and advised XXXX was already aware of the issue. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Long hold time for BofA, called XXXX. XXXX located the funds in an account that is the same # as my SSN. XXXX confirmed the receiving account owner was not the sending account owner, and they would return the funds as soon as the initiating bank reversed or recalled the transaction, but nothing received from BofA yet XX/XX/XXXX : Called BofA, spoke with Claims Dept. The representative forced me back throughexactly the same questions as the week before, and would not allow me to provide the information I had obtained from XXXX ( despite several attempts ). After again explaining that my circumstances left me in urgent need of quick error resolution, I was told that an investigation would be opened and I should receive a response within 10 days. They did nothing until 7 days after I first reported the claim - and only then because I called again. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I received a letter from BofA stating the investigation was closed because the money wasdepositedto the account number provided by me ; therefore the transaction was authorized. The letter also statedthe receiving bank XXXX XXXX XXXX had been notified, and no further information was available. I incorrectly assumed that by BofA notifying XXXX the XXXX banks would now be able return the funds XXXX had already found in their investigation. 
XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX : multiple phone calls to both banks, in all attempts I spoke with managers, both sides claimed they were unable to take action and I had to call the other. BofA claims XXXX is uncooperative and they required a "" Hold Harmless '' form to be completed before they would respond to BofAs investigation. XXXX claims they have responded to BofAs inquiry, and they will return the funds as soon as B of A initiates a RECALL or Reversal. XXXX states they are legally prohibited from taking action without a Reversal or Recall from the initiating bank. Each time I requested they provide me with copies of documentation supporting their statements - so I could take it to the other bank for them. Each time I asked that they speak to each other to figure out what their differences were here. Each time both banks refused to provide any documentation/copies or take any action. 
XX/XX/XXXX : in person meeting with XXXX, thought this would help - the rep understood exactly what happened, agreed it should be resolved and the funds returned, and advised the issue would be escalated to a team that could help. That turned out to be the same team that I was speaking with. 
XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX : multiple e-mails to both banks - with copied of Reg E sections included confirming incorrect electronic funds transfer - which is what I reported - is a covered error, AND separate from the Unauthorized error that was the basis for BofAs initial determination.

I made several successful calls with their credit department but they too could not explain why i could n't use my card and online account.

A couple of weeks later i saw a zero deposit promo from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if you open a savings account with them. So i met with one of their account managers, as one of their requirement they told me that they have to run my credit history. so i agreed.

I was hoping to get a collection notice from BOA but not a single one came and yet everytime i call their hotline they always say that they ca n't handle it since i no longer have an account with them.

Since I had just paid the annual fee one month prior I felt I deserved a refund of the $ XXXX fee since I no longer has access to the account services. 

When I contacted Bank of America they told me they could not credit me the the Annual Fee because charges had posted to my account in XXXX after I paid the annual fee in XXXX, but before I receive the fee increase notice in XXXX. I feel this practice was unfair and somewhat predatory. I paid a fee for services that I was unable to use because I followed the procedures they set. I do not understand why I had to agree to a service charge increase 11 months before my anniversary date and by doing so lost access to the account services I had paid for.

Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/XXXX My wallet was stolen. {$4900.00} was charged to my Bank of America card at a nearby XXXX 's XXXX ( a store I have never shopped at and do not have a membership to ). I responded to alerts on my account, discovered the theft of my entire wallet, shut down my bank and credit accounts and replaced my driver 's license. 
XX/XX/XXXX BA credited me for the fraudulent charges. Great. 
XX/XX/XXXX BA opens a fraud dispute and charges me {$4900.00}. When I investigate these charges, I am told that the initial claim was filed incorrectly ( asserting that the card was still in my possession ) and they would need to resubmit. 
Since then, I have called and spoken to representatives on ( at least ) the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Each time, I have to lead the fraud specialist through the situation, as if there are no notes on my account. As of today, I still have not been repaid. I am a small business owner and this theft put me in the red for XXXX. 
It is worth noting that other cards from my wallet were also used. Every other company resolved the fraud issue quickly and efficiently. I have been using BA products since XXXX, as they like to remind me on every enraging phone call, and have charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to this account. The frustration is almost as bad as the theft."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America sent me a letter informing of their decision to close my credit card. 

They listed reasons that did not apply to my account, my relationship with the bank and an inaccurate credit score. 

I was very concerned, as this is the second credit card closed by Bank of America. The previous closure did not provide a letter indicating the reason for closure.

I spoke with withe 5 different Card Services agents over the course of 30+ days and communicated with them via XXXX. 

Although the last person I spoke with, XXXX, agreed that the reasons listed in the letter did not apply to me, based on their review of my credit report, My accounts remain closed. 

A letter from Bank of America dated XX/XX/XXXX simply stated that we accurately reported to the consumer credit reporting agencies. At this time we consider your dispute closed. 

Curiously, my problems began when I retired."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Fraud concern : I was on XXXX in 2019 for a few months before canceling the benefits in Fall 2019. 

Bank of America continues to send me monthly emails about a XXXX card balance even though I never received my benefits as a prepaid card. Since I do not have a card, I can not view my supposed account since it requires a card number to login. 

I've called BoA multiple times and each time they assure me there is no balance and I will no longer be receiving emails, but the emails keep coming. 

I'm concerned some sort of fraud is being committed in my name to receive benefits that I canceled XXXX years ago"

Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX received fraudulent application material with my name and other personal information, although I live in XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), the attorney for the scam website XXXX provided my name and personal information to XXXX, stating in an email to me that your informations was never used to file for unemployment benefit. The California edd only verified your identity so you could get your grant However, XXXX XXXX set up an account in my name and contacted Bank of America to initiate/service/issue a debit card in my name that was ultimately sent to a scammer, XXXX XXXX [ name withheld here though known to police and BOA ], who emailed me that A card in your name was delivered to me. After learning the card was set up in XXXX, I requested from BOA Consumer Financial Protection Bureau/ Case XXXX all electronic or paper documentation, files, correspondences, and/or communications associated with BOA action to SET UP that debit card with Visa and ISSUE the card to XXXX XXXX [ name withheld here though known to police and BOA ]. I specifically requested any files, etc., with my name and/or personal information 1 ) received by BOA, 2 ) used by BOA to set up the debit card and service it, 3 ) communicated by/with BOA with Visa, and 4 ) communicated with/to XXXX XXXX [ name withheld here though known to police and BOA ]. ( Local police have hit roadblocks to obtaining information or prosecuting. ) I want the account number for the debit card, the amount of money available and/or processed, and amount actually withdrawn. I further seek to know why BOA does not now claim to have any record of servicing the account, opening it in my name, and issuing the card. After many attempts, BOA denied my XXXX request and continues in XXXX to be evasive : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). This account is owned and funded by the State of XXXX XXXX, which is the sponsor of the account. Please note that Bank of America only SERVICES the account, and we did not originate this account. The account in question was OPENED IN YOUR NAME on XX/XX/XXXX, and the INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED to Bank of America to ISSUE A DEBIT CARD to the name and address by the sponsor. ( Note that I here put actions in caps to emphasize what BOA DID, though they are not taking accountability. ) BOA is refusing to provide electronic or paper documentation, files, correspondence, and communication associated with SERVICING the account, OPENING it in my name, and ISSUING the debit card. As part of this I am seeking the INFORMATION PROVIDED to BOA ( NOT the application provided to XXXX XXXX ), any information used by BOA, and any information communicated by BOA. In my most recent phone call ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the rep denied an account had been opened since XXXX and argued that XXXX XXXX should be contacted ; she eventually hung up on me. XXXX also hung up on me after repeating a dozen times I had to contact XXXX XXXX and that she could not help with any of my questions. XXXX received my transfer by mistake and could not wait to get rid of me, sending me to yet another dead-end department. These reps keep referring me back to XXXX XXXX. A BOA Regulatory Complaint rep had earlier in XXXX left a voice-mail to me after my most recent complaint to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Attempts to reach that individual through that department leads only to an extension for voice-mail that does not contain a name. No one has responded to my messages. Despite repeated complaints and messages to XXXX XXXX and the Governors Office, there has been no response. The Federal Trade Commission has interviewed me in XX/XX/XXXX. Every BOA rep spoken with except XXXX has been rude and evasive. One rep even denied an account had been set up in my name, saying the last account was many years ago. This is the worst case of violation of my personal information, and BOA is negligent in taking accountability."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I overpaid my credit balance, combined with a charge refunded back to my card that totaled just over {$1100.00}. On XX/XX/2022 a balance refund was initiated by me, and a check was sent to my address. I informed them 2-3 days after requesting the refund I was moving and was assured it would arrive in time. By XX/XX/XXXX this check had not arrived and I was moving from my house and had to call yet again to cancel this check. I requested the money logically be refunded back to the card it was charged from - the card was very clearly linked to my account. 

They denied being able to find any such account in the system requiring me to provide them with my account information. My account information was restated back to me correctly, the first time. After requesting an estimated time frame for canceling the check and depositing the money into my account ( initially stated as 10 days ) the lady yet again repeated my account information back to me this time INCORRECTLY. 

By XX/XX/XXXX I have heard nothing back from them and no money has been deposited into my account. I called, yet again, to understand what was going on. The next lady assures me that I will be called within 48 hours because the money should most definitely be deposited into my account and she 'escalated "" the issue ( read as did nothing because that is what happened ). Now XX/XX/XXXX ( around XXXX XXXX  ) I call YET AGAIN because I never received a call back within this mythical 48-hour time frame to inform me why my money has not been deposited or what in gods name is happening. 

I was then told, that it was not 10 days, no it is 14 days. I would have my money deposited no later than 14 days, and yet again, wait for the money to be deposited. XX/XX/XXXX, I am now filing my complaint as it has undoubtedly been far longer than the federal regulations allow for my money to be returned upon the initial request for a refund. In fact, it has almost been an entire month since this whole charade started, I still don't have my money, I now have a balance, and they are saying it will take ANOTHER 14 days to even return the money to my credit card. 

This is absolutely absurd. Not only will they not provide me any information I request such as at what point in their 'research ' process they are or have they even attempted to deposit the money back into my account but every time I call I am told the waiting periods for literally anything and everything will take 2 weeks. 

They have my money. They told me they have not tried to deposit it. Why am I waiting 2 weeks for them to put the money back onto the credit card? All I am told is they need this time to do "" research '' ( whatever that is even supposed to mean ) to ensure the money wasn't deposited into an account they have not even tried to deposit the money into."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I obtained my first credit card from Bank of America. This was obviously an exciting time in my life where I could build credit, have a credit card to use for purchases etc. 

Throughout my time with the card ( 8 years ) I had one late payment in XXXX of XXXX. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, the account has been closed by Bank of America effective XX/XX/XXXX. The card had a XXXX XXXX as it was paid off in XXXX of XXXX. 

The reasons stated for closure of the account by a Bank of America representative on XX/XX/XXXX were not disclosed to me as proclaimed. They said they sent a letter out by mail, in which was never received or forwarded to me due to a move from XXXX to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. 

Bank of America is stating the delinquency on other accounts is the reason for the closure. These accounts are not affiliated with Bank of America. These accounts are not delinquent. In fact, my only late payment throughout my credit reporting history was to Bank of America as mentioned above. I have 100 % credit history, with very low balances and utilization as I have worked diligently to build up my credit. 

My credit score as of today XX/XX/XXXX has decreased significantly. The only resolution given by Bank of America was to re apply for the card. This is a huge inconvenience as I intend on purchasing my first home in which we all know is heavily weighed on credit. Why should I have to reapply for a card that was closed for no reason? 

I feel as though this is a violation of FCRA. The information that theyre saying they have does not align with what my credit report states. My credit is in far better standing than it has ever been since I have had this card with Bank of America. 

No credit lending institution should have the ability to pull a consumer credit report at their leisure without permission from the consumer. These guidelines need to be changed. I can only imagine how many  families have been hurt by this very same situation. Were in the middle of a Pandemic, families rely on these institutions in time of despair."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Please see original complaint # XXXX Submitted on : XX/XX/2021 Please see the details in the attachments. 

After I had filed my original complaint, the CFPB contacted Bank of America, who responded by sending me an email ( see attached ) from a department titled "" Regulatory Complaints ''. 

I followed instructions by immediately calling the number listed and the extension of the involved party. 

When the number first connected, the prerecorded opening says, "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '', it never mentions Bank of America. 

The extension number goes right to voicemail. I left 4 total messages between XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I have yet to receive the promised callback within the 48 hours promised in the initial email. 

I tried calling Bank of America directly on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about this department but nobody I spoke to initially, 4 people in at least 3 departments, seemed to be able to figure out if this department actually exists or how to contact them if it did. 

I was finally connected to a person, XXXX XXXX, in the credit department, who was able to figure out how to interpret the codes on the notes in my account and located the "" Regulatory Complaint '' department. XXXX XXXX told me that XXXX XXXX, the individual who I am supposed to contact, was not online at the moment but suggested that he should soon be online and I should expect a call from him soon. That call still has not materialized. 

XXXX XXXX has also provided me with the supervisor, XXXX XXXX, for XXXX XXXX. I have yet to attempt to reach out to XXXX XXXX as I feel this whole episode has been a horrible display of mismanagement and ignorance. 

My perception of this whole issue is that Bank of America is only interested in making money and saving itself from bad publicity."

I also, do not understand if I pay XXXX to monitor my credit and my report was and is locked how did this happen?

He said you have a buisness account under XXXX under XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX, you have a XXXX XXXX card under XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card. I told XXXX XXXX that that is my Dad opening up accounts in my name. The representative states that both the XXXX XXXX and buisness card were opened in XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022 and that there was a balance of {$5000.00} on the business account and {$3000.00} to the XXXX XXXX account. I told XXXX XXXX to cancel my account and they transferred to fraudulent department and an investigation was started. They said id receive something in the mail in 2-4 weeks. I then pulled my credit report from XXXX and saw a Bank of America card opened in XX/XX/2022 which I did not open. I called bank of america and asked what account was opened and they said there is an account open in your name XXXX XXXX but the number, email and address were all my dads information.

I was told that there is a disclosure on my paper statement regarding this - however my activity history would indicate that I access my account online and only make payments online. This is confusing and unfair that I am penalized because I make my payment outside of their determined narrow window of payment date. I am XXXX years old and feel Bank of America is taking advantage of me. I contacted Bank of America 's customer service and was told that it is their policy to access this charge regardless of whether I have made a payment during the month. Bank of America is benefiting from this confusion by not only charging interest on the balance but also accruing late payment penalty charges - in spite of having received a payment that satisfies the minimum due during the month."

Due to travel restrictions imposed by both originating ( USA ) and destination ( XXXX ) governments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, XXXX cancelled my flight. 

I have spent endless hours on phone calls, of which i have recordings, with the online agency. They tell me that my tickets are non-refundable ( which is not true - they're lying in the hopes that they can hold on to my money ). 

I have contacted the airline, they assure me that my tickets are refundable. 

I have logged a complaint with the DOT, which was forwarded to the Arline, which re-iterated that my tickets are refundable, however i must go through the Agency to issue the refund - however the agency doesn't want to issue a refund. 

I have logged a complaint with the XXXX  against the Online Agency - this was forwarded to the Agency to which the agency responded that the tickets are non-refundable and that I must first resolve all my disputes before they ( XXXX XXXX ) can further discuss any potential resolution with me ( at this point, i don't believe them ). 

I have also submitted a dispute with my credit card company Bank Of America - whom, at first, issued a full refund to my Credit Card, but later re-charged my card for the full amount, siding with the agency claiming that the tickets were non-refundable. 

Ultimately, Bank Of America allowed a merchant to defraud me of my money when i was entitled to a full refund. 

As is always the case against corporate giants with deep legal pockets, the consumer is left holding the bill."

Credit card or prepaid card,"In XXXX, 2018, Bank of America sent to the company of which I am a authorized user of a credit card in the name of the XXXX XXXX, a request for information to update their file. I filed this information twice through a branch store, which verified receipt of the information by the corporate office. At the time of filing this information, the bank had frozen any transactions to the account and had closed the account, despite the company having used this account for credit for a number of years with no evidence of delinquency or late payments. The reason given for closure was that the bank had no individual social security number on file as a guarantee of payment. This account had been active for years with no such requirement nor was there any reason for such a request, given the excellent payment history of the account. The XXXX XXXX is a 501 ( c ) ( 7 ) nonprofit organization that operates community pools and a clubhouse. Its governing board is composed of volunteers who are understandably reluctant to furnish a personal social security number to the bank. The members of the governing body feel that the bank has unfairly targeted this account for closure for no reason under normal business practices and request that the account be reinstated."

Despite the removal of the funds from the XXXX XXXX Account, the payment processing has been put on hold for 10 days. When speaking to a managerial representative, they told me that they could not provide an explanation for the hold and could not lift the hold ( although initially the representative said that they delay transfers to confirm funds, I told them that the funds had already been withdrawn from my checking account ). 

I cashed out a MONTH of leave so I could make a larger than normal payment on the credit card - the larger-than-average payment is the only explanation I can think of for why the processing hold was put in place. The extended inability to use those funds ( since they have been removed from the checking account and are unusable in the credit account ) has placed me under extreme financial duress."

When I called to claim my rewards another account manager, and supervisor told me the only way to get my rewards is to have them run my credit again and see if they can open up the account and put my points back on it.

Those supplemental charges from the merchant were added on several months after the trip was paid in full. I have asked on multiple occasions for the Bank of America to provide documentation from the merchant showing that the added charges were noted to the client as being supplemental at the time the booking charge was totaled by the merchant and was paid in full as required prior to taking the trip. 

The Bank of America has not, and can not provide documentation showing the validity of the charge and that the client was pre-informed of these charged beforehand and agreed to them. If the Bank of America can provide documentation showing that the client was notified at the time of booking that the total stated and paid was to later include further supplemental charges then please provide that documentation and the billing will be paid upon receipt. 

Otherwise, if the Bank of America can not provide documentation showing the client had been advised of further supplemental charges and agreed to such charges then this issue is now closed since the dispute has been unresolved by the Bank of America for a period of over 7 months. 

It appears that since the merchant and the Bank of America can not provide the documentation that the charges were "" hidden '' and not defined to the client prior to taking the trip or included within the paid in full total amount invoiced by the merchant."

Bank of America is very difficult to work with and they will not remove fraudulent reports on my credit report. I have made reports to the three credit reporting agencies. Bank of America simply replies to a request by verifying that the account was closed but they do not acknowledge proof that I requested the account and they do not direct the credit agencies to remove the fraudulent account information. What options do I have to correct this? Phone calls to Bank of America customer service are almost impossible for getting anywhere with this problem. Any suggestions welcomed. Thank you, XXXX XXXX"

Credit card or prepaid card,"To whom it may concern : On XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX account was hacked by persons unknown and they made a reservation in XXXX XXXX for XXXX for the amount of {$720.00} on my credit card in question, XXXX from Bank of America . I was made aware of these charges early on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX by an email from XXXX telling me that my account was accessed by this person. I immediately called Bank of America and had the card cancelled and reported it as fraud through both XXXX and Bank of America. 

XXXX customer service has not reached back out to resolve the matter, though they did cancel the booking and return the cleaning fee as prescribed in the Cancellation Policy, which was in the amount of {$100.00}. I DID NOT make this reservation and should not be held responsible for the remaining funds, in the amount of {$610.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America denied my claim and told me that XXXX "" provided documentation '' that I "" received the services '' for the charges. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX as soon as I saw this and their department for Fraud Services was open for business. I spoke with a representative who re-opened my claim and asked me to send in any evidence I can think of. I faxed over an XXXX page document with an itemized list of information including messages between myself and XXXX where they acknowledged the suspicious/fraudulent activity on my account and locked my account and messages between myself and the host of the XXXX  where the host told me that XXXX cancelled the reservation and told the host that it was fraud and they ( the host ) would receive no funds. 

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX my claim was closed and marked as "" Resolved ''. I called the appropriate department and they told me they never received the faxed in documents and they were denying my claim again. I told them I would refax and mail in the documents and to please reopen my claim. They did so at my request, and I refaxed the forms and mailed them in. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I called the correct department to verify that my claim was still open and that I had sent the documents. They confirmed my claim was open, but told me they had not received the forms yet and that it can take up to XXXX weeks to process any faxed or mailed information. At approximately XXXX XXXX, I got a notification stating that Bank of America XXXX my claim again since they "" had not received any further information. '' On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called the Fraud Claim department at approximately XXXX MST ( XXXX EST ) to have them reopen my claim and notate that I had sent in the documents AGAIN. I went to a local branch and had them fax the documents and I then refaxed them again for a fourth time through my personal fax, verifying the fax number each time and receiving confirmations that they were received and successfully sent. I then prepared them for mail. At approximately XXXX MST ( XXXX EST ) I received a notification that Bank of America XXXX XXXX close my claim and deny it again because they still hadn't gotten the forms despite my having faxed them XXXX different times and mailed them in. I also spoke with several different associates and they ensured me they would notate it on my account. 

As of Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, they have reopened my claim and I have filed a complaint with their company. I refaxed the forms again on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX and have mailed them in again as well to the appropriate XXXX XXXX XXXX They have not gotten back to me and continue to give me the run around. I am writing this to warn others that Bank of America is not to be trusted and has truly failed me as a consumer, despite having been a loyal customer of theirs for over XXXX years.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have opened a Dispute with Bank of America and it was filed under the wrong description and miscategorized as my friend was the one that helped me with the initial Dispute.I called several times to have them work through this with me and edit the information since I have proof that the merchant was never shipped to me and seller took my money. Bank of America seems to be adamant in helping me out. Today XX/XX/2018 I called again and the supervisor I was talking to hung up on me when I offered to email proof that seller never shipped merchandise to me. Bank of America should be helping me not killing me and I am very appalled.Seller gave me tracking number from XXXX as XXXX ( number does not exist ) in tracking system. I believe I have been scammed.

I attached correspondence with the merchant to this Dispute."
Credit card or prepaid card,I received a text alert and email asking if I opened an account on XX/XX/12 as well as an email address verification asking me to call if I do not recognize this activity. The alternate billing account was listed for California and no transactions were made yet. Bank of America has closed the account and will be sending me the application.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a credit card with Bank of America in XX/XX/2020 via their website. I was declined. There was no way for me to contact them once I received the declination response. No phone number, no email. I waited for their decision in the mail. The corresponding letter said my application was declined because I had too many accounts that were recently opened and that I had limited deposit or investment balances with them and their affiliates. Again though, nowhere was there a way for me to contact an underwriter or representative by phone or email. It was clearly a form letter because most of the smattering of words all over this letter was about how I could obtain a copy of my credit report and tools to help me with my credit. 

On one of the back pages was a postal mailing address where I could write them a letter via snail mail. I sent them a letter asking what I needed to do to get my application approved. Should I close a different account? Could I get a lower limit? What if I provided proof of other funds? I even went as far as sending them a recent pay stub and asking them to contact me with what was needed. 

Weeks later ( today ), I received correspondence from them. It was the exact same form letter the sent me before. Why did I take all the time and effort for a sincere application in earnest only to be declined with only form letters being sent to me. In fact, this lazy and insulting attitude is the exact opposite of what Bank of America purports in their corporate mission statement : to help make financial lives better by connecting clients and communities to the resource they need to be successful. They never had any intention of connecting with me."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I made a transaction with my card, on XX/XX/2020 transfer was the transaction I made from my account so I really want to log on my account to view my account statement and perform other transactions I guess I was unable to log on it because someone tampered with my password, so I need you to email a link on how to reset and verify proving am the rightful owner of this prepaid car, you can contact me here ..

I have called BOA, and Bank of America says my claim is fraudulent because XXXX XXXX are not allowed to collect unemployment that is why they have debited my EDD debit card for {$16000.00} which is the total that they have paid me so far. 

California EDD department investigated my claim and has verified my Identification and has approved my unemployment claim. 

State of California is direct depositing my unemployment benefit money into my BOA EDD debit card, but BOA is keeping my unemployment benefit money and prohibiting me from withdrawing my benefits because they have taken the position that my EDD claim is fraudulent, even though EDD has investigated and found my claim to be valid. 

3 times I have called XXXX and was transferred to the claims department in order to file a dispute, and then I have been put on hold for about 3 hours each time. 

I am requesting Bank of America to give me credit on my EDD debit card for {$16000.00} as soon as possible."

Credit card or prepaid card,"The credit card was on auto pay, and Bank of America still processed a payment on the account, causing a credit balance of {$1100.00}. After a phone call, they indicated they would send the balance back to our payment account within 5 business days. This was not done. I referenced a legal requirement found that indicated that a financial institution would have seven days to provide a refund if requested in writing. I contacted BofA to obtain this address and was told they did not have a place to send these inquires. I told them this was contrary to the law and was met with silence."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2022, I received an email from Bank of America ( BoA ) notifying me of a successful credit card application in my name ( despite fraud alerts on my CRA accounts ). I immediately contacted BoA and was bounced around between multiple departments with long hold times, but after around 3-4 hours on the phone, I was told the issue was resolved and that the hard pull on my credit report would be removed, the account would be closed, and I would receive a copy of the application in the mail. 

On XX/XX/2022, I received a letter from Bank of America with no additional contact information stating that "" We've verified the inquiry placed on your file XX/XX/2022 '' and "" This means we won't be adjusting our reporting like you requested and consider this dispute resolved. '' I again contacted BoA on XX/XX/XXXX and was transferred once to a recorded message, called back and escalated to a manager who said I would need to call the fraud department in the morning. I call the numbers he gave me ( XXXX and XXXX ). Both of those numbers were unsuccessful, but I was given another number of XXXX for the "" correct '' fraud department now. After 40 minutes, this agent had investigated my record and said the CRA refused to remove it and I had to dispute the hard inquiry with them. XXXX states that hard inquiries must be disputed with the company making the inquiry, so this is not consistent. This agent gave me two more numbers to call, XXXX to dispute the rejection of the hard inquiry, and XXXX for Victim 's Assistance to try to get a copy of the application ( which apparently requires me to send copies of ID via mail ) and to see if they can help more. 

I am now approaching 6 hours on the phone and more than 10 hours of time spent trying to find contact information and strategies to dispute this rejection. The BoA agents have been unwilling to provide me an address for official correspondence so that I can send an official dispute letter as recommended by identifytheft.gov. 

I am astounded at how hard a major financial institution makes it to dispute and resolve a fraudulent inquiry. I contacted them nearly immediately after receiving the email to report the fraud, but by their letter, it appears they do not believe that claim and provide me with no means to continue the dispute."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I received my credit card bill from Bank of America. I have been making payments towards this bill for a year. Each time I paid more than the minimum balance and each of those were paid on time. In XXXX, I paid my entire balance in full. Once again the payment was made on time. I thought that would be the end of it, "" paid in full ''. Two weeks later I received a credit card bill from BOA. The charge was for interest, {$82.00}. When I called them to find out the reason, they informed me that because I did not pay the last two payments in full, the interest was added daily and that is how they computed the amount that I owe BOA. With this logic, that means that BOA charged me interest on the remaining balance that I paid off, and still charged interest on the grace period as well. I was being charged double for the same bill."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX an attempt was made to pay my credit card through my local Bank of America XXXX XXXX {$1000.00} Was initially deposited however {$100.00} was returned due to being an old bill. After returning the bill the machine froze and after a brief wait it switched back to the welcome screen, never providing confirmation of payment or any receipt. On XX/XX/21 I went to the branch in an attempt to resolve the manner, I was directed to their credit card support phone line. Upon calling the support line I repeated said facts related to the incident, and was told that a claim would be opened and I would hear a response within XXXX business days. It is currently XX/XX/21 and I have yet to receive any communication or resolution from Bank of America related to the issue."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for the credit card for the purpose of home improvements and was approved for {$18000.00}. On my online profile, it now it shows approx {$4900.00} credit limit. I made attempts to reach out to customer service, however I was not able to reach anyone. I am seeking the reason for this reduction."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On or about XX/XX/2022 I filed CFPB Complaint # XXXX. I received the attached email on XX/XX/2022 from a resolution specialist at Bank of America 's Regulatory Complaints Department, asking to confirm I am the party who filed the CFPB complaint. I confirmed filing the CFPB complaint and requested copies of the evidence the bank has regarding the fraudulent transaction and I never received such evidence from the bank. The bank has now re-opened the dispute and I am again requesting the evidence in the bank 's posession be sent to me so I can examine it and be afforded due process rights to challenge said evidence. In the interim, I have paid the full disputed balance and I am requesting the {$220.00} in accumulated interest charges be waived since the bank has re-opened the dispute."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a Bank of America credit card from XX/XX/2017, recently I received a letter from Bank of America stating that they closed my account. The reason for closing my account was that they received information from XXXX. I have a membership with XXXX  that I check my credit record with regularly. The time that they closed my account I did not have any suspicious activity going on with my XXXX account. I contacted Bank of America multiple times to find out why they closed the account, the only thing they said is that the letter we sent you should already explain the reason. I tried to get information from them on how to reopen my account. I contacted them 3 different times and spoke with 3 different people and got 3 different answers. Once they said I am welcome to reapply to reopen my account, they said I would get a soft inquiry which won’t hurt my credit and then when I agreed they wanted to transfer me to a different department that could help me further. When I spoke with that department the representative was very rude and gave me a totally different approach on the issue. He said when reopening my account I will get hard inquire. My main concern is why has my account been closed, and they could not give me a decent answer. Then I called them back a couple of days later and each time they gave me different information and answers. By this point I’m complaining to see if the problem is on my side. By law they have a give me a reasonable explanation on why they closed my account. I can submit my XXXX credit report so you guys can see that everything is normal. By law in the credit card agreement it does not state that the bank can just close your card anytime they like."
Credit card or prepaid card,I just pay late one day and just once. I am going to call to remove my late fee and interest fee. But they do not help me. They have a strategy to remove the late fees once a year. But I don't know why they are not going to help me.
Credit card or prepaid card,"A Bank of AmericaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX opened in my name and mailed to my house in XXXX of this year. I called their fraud dept and had them close the card. I also froze and monitored my credit and had the hard inquiry removed. Just a few days ago I received a fake letter for the card i closed saying it was approved ( dated XX/XX/22 ). I believe the scam was to steal my info, open the card, and then send this letter to get me to call them back so they could get more info."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America XXXX XXXX shut down my credit card and reissued me with a replacement and claimed this was because of a fraud dispute they had identified by a company called XXXX though I could not see the charge on my statement. I had a previous fraud claim against this company back in XXXX, and was told by XXXX XXXX that the company was now blocked. I asked how a new attempt could be made against my card once it was blocked -and they did not explain. The next day, on XX/XX/XXXX, two new fraud dispute claims had been entered into my card account -one for an XXXX charge and another for XXXX charge, both of which I had authorized. I told them I did not report those as fraud claims and the charges were fine. They then said the disputes had been entered by one of their fraud representatives -XXXX XXXX   . I asked how that could be since I never reported those charges as fraud and never authorized them to be entered. I believe that my privacy and card security have been compromised by these false fraud claims having been entered without my knowledge or authorization and that mu card was shut down because of this and that Bank of America will not explain what happened or why."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I went into Bank of America XX/XX/19 to close out my checking account and leave my credit card account open. My credit card had automatic payments through the now closed checking account. Bank of America 's online banking platform did not let me add or adjust and new payment methods to my credit card due to a glitch in their system. I made a payment through their phone system manually on XX/XX/19 to satisfy that month 's payment. I contacted them again several days later to fix my online banking profile to a "" credit card only '' profile which would then allow me to make payments from an external bank account. With their assistance, I updated my automatic payment instructions to be debited from my new bank account and I did exactly as I was instructed to have all automatic payments come from my new bank account. On XX/XX/19 this automatic payment was made for {$17.00}. On XX/XX/19 this payment came back return unpaid and Bank of America charged me a returned payment fee of an additional {$17.00}. I got two letters in the mail on XX/XX/19 that this payment went unpaid. After multiple phone calls on XX/XX/19 I found out that this was unpaid because the automatic payment tried to pull from my now closed Bank of America checking account instead of my new external account. Bank of America refuses to refund the return item fee because it was deemed not a bank error since I was the one who set up the payment, even though it was entirely through their instruction on how to set it up and I was reassured all future payments would come through my external account. I tried to get the issue resolved in person at a branch, through multiple phone calls to their credit card support and escalated to a supervisor and all attempts were unsuccessful. After spending hours trying to get this resolved, I closed my credit card account on XX/XX/19 by paying off the full amount including the extraneous fee as I no longer could deal with their unhelpful customer support."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello I am reaching out to you in hopes of assistance or be directed to the proper person at Bank Of America to handle this extremely urgent issue. One in which we have been very patient about. However, that is no longer the case. We are at 7 months since the incident occurred and absolutely no refund from Bank of America regarding my funds that were paid to XXXX for a trip that was canceled due to the Airport being on strike in XXXX. So, we could not fly there with no airport being open on those days. XXXX and its hotel, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. There was a strike at the airport in XXXX. This prevented travel to the island and stay at XXXX 's hotel, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. 

Clearly this was no fault of ours as consumers and guest. Yet, we are being held at fault and have not been refunded our funds for our scheduled stay. To penalize us the consumer for something out of our control and not responsible for and being prohibited from reaching the location is completely unfair and unsatisfactory. An organization such as Bank of America should understand the situation and circumstances. 

We paid {$2900.00} for our trip. Bank of America paid XXXX. As a Bank of America customer, I did not get the service I was charged for and requested my funds returned back as this would be fraudulent. XXXX agrees as they advised that my Bank should refund my funds.. Yet we received no service or resort stay. 

We expect our funds to be returned. 

Thank You, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"On my Bank of America credit card, I was charged a {$23.00} late fee in XX/XX/2021 because auto pay was not set up. Auto pay was not set up because i use their mobile app and it is impossible to set up auto pay on the mobile app as they could not walk me through how to do it on the app. I then call to ask them to waive the fee because i have perfect payment history and explained to them i couldn't set up auto pay on the app. They refused to waive the fee. 

Bank of America is purposely making it difficult to enroll in auto pay so they can earn money from late fees."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This is my second complaint about this matter. Bank of America credit card suddenly reduced my credit limit by {$25000.00}, to {$500.00}, though I had paid off a {$36000.00} balance a year ago and though I rarely use the card and am always up to date with my payments. I have been their customer for fifteen or twenty years. By reducing my limit in this way, they triggered an avalanche of problems for me on my credit score, causing other cards to follow suit and lowering my credit score by FIFTY POINTS. I am trying to refinance my mortgage during a difficult divorce and now will be unable to do so. I reported them for this problem several months ago and they told CFPB that they needed more time to "" work on it. '' Since then, silence and nothing changed with my account. 

I should note that about the avalanche described above -- another one of my cards reduced my limit after Bank of Am did so, but only from XXXX to XXXX. This impacted my score only slightly. There is absolutely no reason that Bank of Am could not do a similarly small reduction in credit, covering whatever concern they had without destroying my life for a card I rarely even use at present."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am writing about my Bank of America Credit Card. I have enrolled in AutoPay more than once, and the payments fail to be automatically applied as the service promises.

The bank account I wished to be used for autopay appears in my account profile on the mobile app, but representatives could not explain why autopay failed to occur.

Calls to the company have demonstrated the company 's inability to service the account, application, or services. 

The last call was placed on XX/XX/2022, when I spoke with XXXX, who was unable to service the account. I asked XXXX to be transferred to his supervisor. 

XXXX was told esplicitly that my husband was granted full permission to diuscuss this account while I showered. However, when XXXX XXXX, supervisor XXXX came on the line, he refused to service the account without speaking to me again, despite explicit instructions given to XXXX during this recorded call. When XXXX XXXX refused to discuss the account despite this express permission, my husband excercised his legal right to request that the call be reviewed to verify this iformation on the recording, XXXX XXXX refused. 

My husband requested to be transferred to XXXX XXXX 's supervisor, in light of XXXX XXXX 's refusal provide assistance. After quite some time on hold, My husband was transferred to XXXX ( ID # XXXX ), who declined to provide a last name or initial. XXXX patently explained that no one would be able to help us with auto pay over the phone, and refused to provide further assistance in that effort. 

At this point, I placed a three-way call with another company to initiate a balance transfer to close the account permanently, but the call on-the-line with Bank of America was terminated, and no follow up call was received. At this point, I was bound by a prior comittment and was unable to call back."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I disputed a service charge with Bank of America for {$1000.00} which I considered fraudulent, as a former XXXX  with fraud experience. They advised it was not a fraud if i initiated the service. I did not initiate until after the service provider offered a discount, a very public offer made on his XXXX XXXX. Bank of America advised that the service provider was under no obligation to honor that discount and essentially left me "" holding the bag. ''"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am a senior citizen and banking customer for 25 years, I have had my credit card in question for over 15 years without ever any issues. I also maintain an XXXX point credit score. This means nothing to the bank they cancelled my card without any notice, They did say they sent me a notice but I never received one they could have emailed a notice or alert or posted it in my online banking site for me before closing this account. They told me now they could not reinstate it after my request and want me to reapply for a new one, which I refuse to do. I place the blame on the Bank for never notifying me any way by email or through my online banking notice or regular mail. So after not notifying me they just canceled my card. The customer service is very unsatisfactory bellow par and my bank has thrown me out after many years of me being a loyal customer mortgage holder and credit card holder. I am not going to reapply for a new card like I am a new customer. I want my card reinstated or send me a new one with a new number but I 'm not reapplying for a card I owned for 15 years. I will apply at another bank before I do that.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Complaint against Bank of America On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by an official DHS number informing me that I was the main subject of a money laundering operation and that my profession as an anti-money laundering analyst strengthened their suspicion. I would later come to find that these individuals were not whom they said they were a defrauded me for over {$25000.00}. While on the call a number from XXXX Texas Police Department came through which the fake DHS rep told me to answer as they were 'working with local law enforcement '. The local police number confirmed what the DHS rep had told me and when I was skeptical of their claims they then e-mailed me an XXXX XXXX with instructions of how to handle the situation while under investigation. This included putting my funds into pay vouchers to avoid my funds being frozen which would be returned to me at the end of the investigation period if I was found to be innocent. The next 2 days consisted of them surveilling me and forcing me to convert my funds into pay vouchers via XXXX as well as the majority of my credit limit on my cards so a potential perpetrator would not be able to do so themselves. XXXX, they said, is one of the companies whom law enforcement has an arrangement with for these circumstances and would allow for me to be refunded. As I continued to grow frustrated with the process I contacted XXXX Police Department on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX directly and asked for XXXX XXXX whom the fraudster claimed to be, and I was told there was no XXXX XXXX and that I would need to contact XXXX Police Department to inform. 

I spoke with police on XX/XX/XXXX and they walked me through what I needed to do to try and mitigate the situation the best I could and also contacted Target to alert. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report, contacted the financial institutions which were impacted to report fraud, canceled cards, changed user names & passwords etc. 

My complaint is specifically for Bank of America whom I initially contacted on XX/XX/XXXX to report fraud. They made me inform 3 different departments of fraud for my checking account, Debit Card and Credit Cards. I was told that the process would take a week and they would reach out to discuss next steps. A week passed and I heard nothing back. I checked the other financial institutions I contacted to report fraud and they had all refunded charges and issued me new credit cards, except for Bank of America. 

I then contacted Bank of America again on XX/XX/XXXX for a status update and checking/debit departments said that there was no update, but they would expedite to a 48-hour update window ( which I still haven't heard back from as of XX/XX/XXXX ), and then transferred me to the credit card department to see if there was a status update there. 

The credit card department then said I never filed a fraud case ( blatantly incorrect ) but yet also said they determined it wasn't fraud somehow. They then backtracked to say they did see that I called in to notify, but even though I was deceived and defrauded ( which by legal definition is fraud ), I would not receive any credit back. I then asked how have they left my 2 credit card accounts I filed fraud on and requested new cards wide open for 3 weeks and they said it was a mistake and they would do that immediately which they have still not done. 

Lastly, after I had been defrauded for every penny I have and an additional {$13000.00} in credit charges Bank of America refuses to forgive, I had to sell my only vehicle just so I could eat and pay bills. Upon deposit of the check from selling my vehicle, Bank of America only cleared 40 % of the check inexplicably leaving 60 % of the check on hold. The check was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX and is still not cleared. This also needs to be resolved."

Credit card or prepaid card,"The bank, Bank of America, has changed the auto pay system and removed my autopay external account, the account was defaulted because of this, I was not able to access the autopay system to remedy the situation. I had to be on the phone in a long wait to make a payment by phone and even after this payment was honored by the second bank did not credit to may credit card account and I received a new statement with an outstanding balance. Not the first time this bank technical problems prevented me from making transactions with other banks. They do not honor external transfers and change the system with migration errors."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017, Bank of America ( BOA ) automatically charged our credit card account for a credit card payment of {$1600.00} AFTER we paid manually online -- billing us twice. We had made a request for automatic payment a year earlier, and it failed due to an issue with our other bank, and thus we did not have automatic payment set up. <P/>We complained, and the second charge was refunded on XXXX XXXX, 2017. BOA told us that for some reason, the automatic payment process had suddenly activated, thus generating the double billing. BOA claimed that the error with automatic billing was solved. <P/>When we later reviewed our statement, we saw that the amount appeared once again as a charge on XXXX XXXX, 2017. In a call on XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX from the Virginia office said that BOA had decided to apply the refunded amount to our current balance when it was originally refunded. They also refunded our other bank account separately. Thus they claim they paid us twice, and had to debit our account once again for {$1600.00} to account for the fact that they had used that amount to pay the past balance. <P/>The amount also improperly generated interest on the account. <P/>The misapplication of the refund to our current balance is a Books and Records violation, as is the failure to have a control in place for double-charging. BOA claimed that they have such a control, and that they "" automatically '' refunded the discrepancy, but that did n't occur until we made a complaint and compelled them to acknowledge and correct the error. These lack of controls also allowed interest to be generated on the account during that period. <P/>It is not clear how they improperly activated automatic payment in the first place, and XXXX from the Virginia office refused to address that issue in the XX/XX/XXXX call, saying, "" well, however it was done, whether we did it, or you did it, that 's what happened. '' This is after the previous call when another service representative acknowledged BOA had made an error and claimed that they had fixed it."

I have been a BoA customer for more than 10 years. My FICO score is around XXXX. There is no negative mark on my credit report.

Credit card or prepaid card,"This complaint relates to Bank of America. Background : The State of Michigan sent a letter about pending unemployment benefits. I've never filed for unemployment, and am the victim of identity theft of my name/SSN. I reported this at State of Michigan unemployment site. Subsequently, I've received a Bank of America Michigan Unemployment account debit card in my name ( never requested, fraudulent ) for unemployment fund access, with activation instructions. I've attempted to get BOA to close this out immediately as the account is fraudulent. However, Bank of America call number provides no path for this. Their online support options are only available for activated cards/accounts. Their hotline simply points users to State of Michigan site, which is non-responsive to requests. I am resourceful at navigating customer support systems but this one seems to provide no path for this type of fraud. I believe that BOA has the legal responsibility to completely close down fraudulent accounts, but they seem to block any venue for reporting that fraud ( perhaps due to the high rates of unemployment fraud, and the service overhead this would cost them in administering their cards ). Any help is appreciated, thanks."
Credit card or prepaid card,"The Bank of America ( BOA ) is trying to squeeze every XXXX from me that it can because the U. S. Post Office ( USPS ) has not delivered my credit card payment, {$110.00}, due XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I can provide recent examples, in local mail service, of the USPS inability to provide prompt delivery service, due, either to the lack of diligence and/or the lack of employees, many out sick with Covid. 

I paid my BOA bill for the period ending XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$110.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( See BOA Statement XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, showing order in which checks were written ). 

On XXXX XXXX, as soon as I learned my payment had not been received, I called BOA asking how I could pay this debt immediately to avoid any fees, interest or other charges because my payments have never been late. Their representative suggested a one time funds transfer from my checking account would eliminate any fees or interest. I agreed, thinking that because it was an electronic transaction the funds would be credited to my BOA account immediately. The payment wasnt debited from my XXXX checking account until XXXX XXXX and in the amount of only d {$350.00}. Because BOA had not forgiven the fees and interest the bill had not been paid in full, as was my and more fees had been added ( See XXXX  credit rpt XXXX  1 & 2, Fees Bank of America, XXXX statement PE XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). 

BOAs response seems ( See BOA response -1 and 2 jpgs ) to be a generic letter, stating their rights. It appears that no review of my conversation with their agent was done. The agent said that if I paid the bill by bank transfer, no fees or interest would be charged. I provided BOA with a reference number and other specifics as shown in Fees Bank of America Now I am up to date on my BOA credit card payment ( See Checkbook -2.jpg ). However, my banks representatives tell me I am liable for the check payment of {$110.00}, in perpetuity. There is no time limit on cashing a personal check, unlike a check written by a business. I must maintain the amount as a liability and am not able to spend it or close my BOA account. 

I ask for the return of all fees, interest and other monies over the amount of the original debt. This amount will then cover the charges for cancelling the check. 

I did my best to pay BOA, their agent gave me incorrect information concerning the cancelling of incurred charges, BOA didnt do a thorough investigation, I am an on time payer. I deserve some consideration for being a good customer.

Credit card or prepaid card,"At the end of XXXX there were fraudulent charges on my Bank of America EDD credit/debit card. I was never notified that my card was frozen or that these charges even occurred, I found out on my own when my card was declined while trying to make a purchase. I called Bank of America to open a fraud claim for these charges. There were 15 charges of {$65.00} made at a XXXX  in XXXX XXXX, that I had never been to and is two hours away from where I live, work, shop, ect, and all of these transactions were made within a matter of minutes and were all one right after the other. The total amount taken from my account before my card was frozen was {$970.00}. The first person I talked to about this claim agreed with me that these charges were irregular and looked like fraud. The claims department was closed when I initially called, so my card was shut down and I was sent a new one and I had to call the claims department the following day. I did call the claims department and they opened my claim case. After that, the only communication I received from Bank of America was a letter stating that my claim was open and what my claim number was. Within two weeks my money was put back in my account, so I figured that the investigation came to the conclusion that it was fraud. Again, there was no communication from Bank of America, the money was just back in my account. I thought the issue of my fraud claim was taken care of. Then on the XXXX of XXXX the money was taken back out of my account by Bank of America and it overdrew my account by {$10.00}. I was never sent an alert or notification about the money being taken out or that my account was overdrawn, so again, there was no communication from Bank of America. I, once again, found out when my card was declined when trying to make a purchase. I immediately called Bank of America where the person I talked to was unhelpful, quick to dismiss me, and tried to transfer me to the claims department which they already knew was closed. So, the next morning I tried to go into my local Bank of America branch to sort out what was going on with my account and why my fraud claim was apparently denied ( I was never specifically told that this is what happened ) when it seemed like an obvious open and shut case. I was told that the only way to find out was to call the claims department, which meant I was unable to deal with this issue face to face and was forced to do it over the phone. That same day I did call the claims department with plenty of time before they closed for the day, but they left me on hold for almost two hours ( one hour and forty minutes ) which put me on hold past the time they technically closed. I still have no resolution to this issue and I still have not been notified of Bank of America 's reasoning or documentation as to why they would have denied my fraud claim. To others, {$970.00} may not seem like a lot of money, but for me it's the difference between whether or not I can pay my bills."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America Master Card charged a {$25.00} late fee and {$8.00} interest charge for the XX/XX/2020 billing period. 
The United States postal service was extremely slow during this period, as is very common knowledge. Their bill was received late and the payment was also likely delayed. 
My payment did show up on the XXXX invoice, so the payment was not so late. Charging late fees and interest when everyone knows the mails are running slow is in itself a scam. 

XXXX, North Carolina XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"A fraudulent charge of {$55.00} appeared on my XX/XX/XXXXcredit card statement. It stated that I used my card at XXXX store # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to make a purchase. I reported the charge to Bank of America, and received a new card with a new number. When I first reported the fraudulent charge in XX/XX/XXXX, I did not provide receipts or any other proof. I received a letter from Bank of America dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my claim was denied. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to recover receipts from said date of XX/XX/XXXX that showed that I did not make the {$55.00} purchase. I then went to a local Bank of America branch and provided this proof, which they faxed to the appropriate department. A few days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating my claim was resolved in my favor, and they would let me know if they needed any additional information. I never heard anything more, until XX/XX/XXXX, when I received another letter from Bank of America stating that my claim was denied again. Due to this conflicting information, I called Bank of America. I have made several phone calls and have been transferred to so many different customer service associates, most of whom are apologetic, some of whom agree that there was an egregious mistake on their end, but it still hasnt been resolved. I proceeded to contact corporate customer care, and submitted my issue by email. I was contacted by them within 2 business days, and had to repeat the same story to this person, who asked me many questions, and also told me I could try to resolve it with the merchant, or report it to a credit bureau. So I called the merchant and tried to resolve it with them, but was told it must be resolved with the bank. Meanwhile, the Bank of America associate said they would reopen the claim. When I called again yesterday to confirm this, I was put on hold and promised a return call but I was never called back. Bottom line is, I did not make this {$55.00} purchase. I have been a Bank of America credit card holder for 30 years."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Approximately 3 weeks ago I noticed a withdrawal and I believe it was 2 charges that did not belong to me or did I consent to them. So, the account was closed and a new card was issued that was also closed when I received it. In the interim I was told it would take approximately 5 business days to resolve the matter. There have been additional deposits made to the card and I have not been able to access any of the money on the card. BANK OF AMERICA also has engaged in false advertising claiming XXXX liability to the consumer for charges unauthorized, to the card. I have done everything required and still am forced to wait any help you may provide will assist me and many others to move forward"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I XXXX  four years ago in XXXX XXXX and came to live in XXXX. I moved the address of my corporate checking and credit card to my XXXX location and continued to pay it. I had problems paying the corporate credit card, with no warning, they took the money out of my husband 's and my checking account as a Bank Card Debit. I called the corporate credit card phone center to complain they answered that it was normal for them to take the money out of my account because I was a warrantor on the corporate card, my husband is not. I proceeded to close my corporate checking account and continued to pay the business card when the pandemic hit, I asked for a forbearance plan, and it was granted until XX/XX/2020. At the beginning of XXXX, they sent an email to my husband 's account informing me to remember that the plan was to finish XX/XX/2020, and to make the payment on the card. 
I called the corporate card and asked the question, why did they not send me the email to my corporate account? They tell me they don't know how this happened, I feel they violated my privacy, and are getting away with it from the get-go."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I phoned Bank of America about interest charges that they charged me that I felt were charged incorrectly/unlawfully. They told me that they are required by the government to allocate my payments to the cash advance before my most recent purchases, even when I am paying more than the minimum and well over the minimum + purchases + paying down the cash advance. 

They are now stating that because the account has a balance ( due to the 0 % cash advance amount that should not be charged interest until XX/XX/XXXX ) they are charging me interest on the small purchases I more than pay for every month as I am trying to pay off the cash advance in a timely manner. 

I pay the minimums + whatever I purchased during the previous statement billing cycle + additional money to pay down the 0 % cash advance and they are still charging me interest. 

On one statement it appears as interest on my current statements purchase ( at the rate of over 18 % ) even though I more than paid those off that month. 

On the next statement there is just a vague fee titled minimum interest charge. 

They would not reverse the fees and told me I would be charged interest on new purchase until I paid off my cash advance ( which has 0 % interest until XXXX! ). 

To the best of my understanding this completely violates the Credit Card Act of 2009."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am a new Bank of America Customer. I am starting to regret this decision. On XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment of 200 over the phone with a representative. That same day, another payment of 1000 was taken out of my checking account by Bank of America. When I realized they did this, I called them immediately to request a refund. The agent then informed me my refund request was processed and I should received my funds within 3 to 5 business days. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America again to confirm that my funds indeed were processed. they claimed it was processed but instead of receiving it in 3 days, it will take a week. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America to ask why I haven't received my funds. I escalated the issue to a supervisor who informed me that my funds were processed however it will take 2 billing cycles for me to receive my money. At that point, I was very furious. Everyone I talked to, told me something different. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Bank of America again to express my frustration A supervisor informed me I will be receiving the refund soon. They held my 1000 dollars and refused to refund it to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America once again to inquire about my refund, just for a representative to tell me they refunded me XXXX dollar instead of the 1000. The fact that they even took my money without my authorization and lied telling me they refund it and they didn't. They claimed they refunded XXXX dollar in my account. I checked my account and there is no refund from them. This is the worse bank ever and I'm still new. All their customers service rep lie and some of them have no idea what they're telling their customer."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Bank of America customer service due to suspicious activity involving my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX upon logging in to my account online. There were 3 three transactions in Pending status ( Two transactions on XX/XX/XXXX, both in the amount of {$80.00}, and both to the same company : XXXX XXXX XXXX - an electronics company, and another transaction onXX/XX/XXXXto XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  in the amount of {$16.00} ).

The supervisor, XXXX, stated that even though the transactions were pending that the charges had already been processed and they could not be reversed. She stated I would have to fill out multiple documents online, some of which required me to make police reports and affidavits that needed to be

notarized. 1. ) I never lost my card and likely the card number was stolen from an electronic breach somewhere and was used without my card even being present. 2.
) Bank of America did a poor job of monitoring my account for suspicious activity and allowed a XXXX card to be used for everything from electronics and towing services from the US east coast to the west coast in a 3 day period. These charges were not declined nor was I even contacted regarding this abnormal activity.

3. ) Bank of America put it on me to go to extreme lengths to refute this activity before they even began to investigate the matter.

4. ) I was and still am unable to use those funds for their true purpose which are medical expenses in my account due to this fraudulent activity that has decreased my available balance.

5. ) Because it's an XXXX  that accrues interest and allows me to invest in the stock market, I am losing out on interest as well as an increased rate of return due to not having those available funds available to me.

6. ) Because XXXX   expenditures are monitored by the IRS and are tax deductible if used solely for health expenses, I now show expenses being used for electronics and car towing purposes that I will have to report on my tax returns that will count account against me thereby causing me to pay tax penalty on these items.

Bank of America has been unwilling and uncooperative in resolving this matter in a timely and proper fashion. What is worse, they have no way of preventing this from happening again as they informed me that they can not alert me via text message for purchases that are made without the card being present as my other personal credit card companies have the ability to do ( note the XXXX app has deplorable reviews and was inoperable for me as it is for many others based on their comments ). XXXX also stated that Bank of America also has no way of notating my account for alerting me of purchases that are made for things other than their intended purpose with are health related expenses.

Bank of America is responsible for rectifying all aforementioned items above due to their poor handling of credit card fraud despite my due diligence of alerting them to the suspicious activity in a timely fashion."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America began offering a credit card named XXXX, which I applied for in XX/XX/XXXX. The principal reason I submitted the application and was interested in the product was its signup bonus, which promised to deliver to the cardholder a certain amount of points ( redeemable against the cardholder 's credit card balance ) if over {$3000.00} is spent on the card within 3 months of approval. The card, however, never arrived at my address. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the number on the promotional materials I initially received on the card to check on the status of the card - and if the promotional points offer was still available to me - to ask for a replacement card. As it had already been nearly 3 months since the card was authorized by Bank of America, it would not be possible to meet the promotion 's prerequisites because the card was never actually available for me. Speaking with a representative, I was told that the bank would place a request to allow me to be eligible for the signup offer for spending the {$3000.00} within 3 months of card activation ( once I receive and activate the card ) rather than within 3 months of approval. With this understanding, I requested the replacement card, received and activated it, and subsequently spent the amount required for the promotion ( I would not have used or even activated the card had I not been supposedly eligible ). The bonus points were never credited to me. 

Between that time and now, I have called Bank of America and XXXX XXXX multiple times. I was first told that they would check on the status of the request and look into it ( this  by a XXXX XXXX representative ). After several weeks without a response, I called again and was told that the original request regarding the points ( from when I first received and activated the XXXX card ) had been denied, months after I had spent thousands of dollars on the XXXX  card. I spoke with multiple supervisors at both Bank of America and at XXXX XXXX ( the XXXX XXXX supervisors I spoke to directed me to Bank of America, who I was told "" handles all decisions '' regarding credit card promotions and requests ). The Bank of America supervisor I spoke to told me that it was in fact XXXX XXXX that is responsible for the decision on this particular card, and directed me back to yet another supervisor at XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX supervisor finally acknowledged that the decision was in fact made by a XXXX XXXX team ( contrary to what I was told earlier that same day ), but that I am unable to contact them and that the decision will not be changed. Their decision was based on the transcripts/recordings of my previous calls with XXXX XXXX, where the associate I spoke with did not "" explicitly promise '' anything ( they will not share the transcripts/recordings with me ). These last several conversations occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I would appreciate any feedback the CFPB can provide on this situation. My primary issue is that I activated and used the XXXX card solely because I was told clearly back in XX/XX/XXXX I would be eligible for the promotional offer given that it was XXXX XXXX 's fault that I never received the card when I first applied and only received it approximately 3 months after the original application was approved. I apologize for making multiple references to both XXXX XXXX and Bank of America ( they are the same company to the best of my understanding ) - I have been referred back and forth between the two institutions throughout this process. 

Unfortunately the XXXX card has been discontinued and Bank of America / XXXX XXXX has removed the materials regarding the card from their websites, so I am unable to attach the original promotional materials. Understanding that it is not a direct or official source, I was able to find this link on the internet regarding the promotional information : XXXX XXXX XXXX  Thank you for your attention."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been a Bank of America customer for over 12 years and I have 2 credit card accounts established with them as well as 3 other personal banking accounts. One credit card has been active since XX/XX/XXXX and the other since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never been late with a payment, I consistently make payments in excess of the minimum monthly payment due, and neither card is at its credit limit. I received a letter this weekend indicating that my accounts were closed permanently and I needed to update any information that was associated with those accounts. The reason given was that my risk profile had changed and did not align with their risk tolerance. The only thing that has changed about my risk profile is that another unrelated credit card account that had no balance- was compromised due to fraud. I was made aware of this by checking my credit report at which time I contacted my credit card company since they had charged late fees and reported the account as delinquent based on the fraudulent charges. The investigation has been completed, the charges and late fees and credit reporting have been removed/reversed. Bank of America made no attempt to call me to make any inquiry or even inform me about the account- they just closed and I was embarrassed at two merchants because the card was declined before I had knowledge of the account closure. When I call the number provided with the letter, I am met with a message that says we are not going to explain any further why we closed the account and we will not reconsider our decision."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been a Bank of America ( B of A ) credit card holder for almost 20 years. Each month, for those many years, my credit card minimum amount due has been paid - automatically - from my checking account with a different bank, and I have not had any problems until approximately 3 months ago. 
At that time, I received notice that my account was "" past-due '', and I was going to be assessed late fees of approximately {$27.00} - all the while assuming my account would be paid the minimum amount due, automatically, as it had been for years. I contacted B of A customer support - multiple times - to get this straightened out, and was eventually told that their previous auto-pay setup was via a program called "" XXXX '', and that was ( or had just been ) phased-out, and replaced with a different B of A system. I was then told that their "" new '' payment process did not allow the setting up of monthly "" minimum payment due '' amounts - only the full balance due, or some pre-set "" fixed amount '' payment could be made. 
The impact of that decision ( for myself and other similar B of A customers ) is that if I were to setup a fixed amount of, say, {$100.00}, and then in the course of the next month, added additional charges to the account, the minimum amount due would then increase above that {$100.00} fixed amount, and I would then be, again, delinquent, and get assessed late payment fees, etc., for not paying the revised and increased, minimum amount. 
After multiple calls to Credit Card Customer Service at B of A, I am being told that their "" new '' system does not allow the setting up of monthly "" minimum payments due '' - which is unlike every other major bank with which I have a credit card relationship. If this is happening to ME, I have a strong feeling other B of A credit card account holders who had setup their accounts for autopay of the minimum amount due under the previous XXXX system, are being charged fraudulent missed payment / late payment fees - without ever being notified of the system being changed, no notice of the impact of those changes, and now having NO option to make automatic minimum payment due amounts ... resulting in many B of A credit card customers being charged bank penalty fees. 
I would like the CFPB to contact B of A 's credit card department for an explanation of why no minimum payment option is available, evidence of how they supposedly notified their cardholders of the changes, and the financial impact to their cardholders. I would imagine these additional penalty/late fees have had an impact to B of A 's bottom line."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This complaint is about the cash advance fee I was charged for the payment I made to the Virginia Department of Tax. On XX/XX/2019, I used my BOA premium card to make the payment of {$10000.00} and later found out that I was charged for cash advance fee. I called BOA on XX/XX/XXXX and questioned the transaction. BOA told me that the credit card processor provided the wrong code. However, they could not explain, even that the case, why the transaction went through because I only had a {$300.00} cash credit line on my BOA premium card. The supervisor, XXXX, said they could turn it into a purchase but asked me to contact the merchant first who may able to fix everything. She also gave me her direct line and promised to follow up. It never happened. In fact, after contacting the merchant who admitted they messed up, I called back BOA multiple times and left three voice messages for the supervisor from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I never heard back from them. I talked to another BOA supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX who refused to provide any help, claiming it is their courtesy to approve large transactions even if you have low cash credit line. However, this is against their statement when I lowered my cash credit line because they told me I could not make any cash equivalent transaction over {$300.00}. 

It is unreasonable because the cash credit line is supposed to help the consumer avoid cash advance fee. It does not make any sense that a reasonable consumer sets up a very low cash credit line ( {$300.00} ) on his credit card and would have such an extremely high amount of transaction ( {$10000.00} ) get approved. They  should never approve a transaction at their will so they can charge clients high cash advance fees."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I filed a dispute at Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX & although initially it took over 10 business days I was never provided the provisional credit as I should have been!

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX Our Financial Controller received a Bank of America Fraud Alert for one of our corporate credit cards totaling {$14000.00}. We verified that they were absolutely fraudulent charges. At the time the cardholder was in XXXX XXXX, CA on vacation and the card was locked in her office at work, which was verified by our Financial Controller. Prior to these fraudulent transactions, the cardholder had not used this card since XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX We received a letter from Bank of America declining our claim in the amount of XXXX. After reaching out to them to inquire why they would not decline these fraudulent charges, our account Manager at Bank of America, XXXX XXXX advised us that the Bank of America Fraud Department requires a police report to be filed before they would look into this matter. This was done by the card holder on XX/XX/XXXX and the report was sent to XXXX XXXX via email. 
On XX/XX/XXXX The cardholder received a phone call stating that the fraudulent charges would not be cancelled and following this call we sent in substantial proof that she was not in XXXX XXXX, NV where most of these charges took place. We repeatedly asked for information on how they came to this conclusion and were told that the card has a chip which can not be copied. After much of our own research, we know this is not true. A chip is completely capable of being copied and we even found the tools to do so online and sent the evidence to XXXX XXXX to alert her Fraud Department. 
On XX/XX/XXXX We received a letter from Bank of America declining the possibility of fraudulent usage for {$13000.00} stating that the assigned PIN was entered at the point of sale, which is not possible because this is a company credit card. There is no assigned pin to be entered at the point of sale. We immediately reached out to XXXX XXXX to let her know that there seems to be a confusion with their fraud department in regards to this claim. This is a credit card with a chip that they are claiming can not be copied yet also saying that the card holder used their pin at the point of sale. 
On XX/XX/XXXX The cardholder called the vendor ( XXXX XXXX ) of the largest purchase on the statement and their finance department verified that their system recognized it as a fraudulent charge, so no merchandise was ever sent out. The charge was for {$2900.00} and made online. The billing and the shipping address did not match up on the card, so this alerted XXXX XXXX of possible fraud. XXXX XXXX told us to contact Bank of America to report this as fraudulent and theyd be happy to refund this money back to the bank. Bank of America had never reached out to XXXX XXXX regarding this claim. All of this was revealed after what Bank of America assured us that there was a thorough investigation done on their part. This reveal prompted us to continue our own investigation and further findings lead us to believe that Bank of America never sought out any relative information or evidence in regards to this investigation. 
The cardholder then contacted the XXXX XXXX which had 2 fraudulent charges for {$1000.00} and {$1300.00} and XXXX XXXX which had 3 fraudulent charges for {$250.00}, {$290.00} and {$310.00}. They confirmed that they were not in-store charges but rather done online, so there was no way that the chip being present or pin being input as Bank of America is claiming as their denial for these charges is possible. Furthermore, they also were never contacted by Bank of America in regards to this claim. 
After emailing our Bank of America Account Manager, XXXX XXXX about what we uncovered, Bank of America credited it us for those specific transactions {$2900.00}, {$250.00}, {$290.00} and {$310.00} but XXXX XXXX stated that in regards to the rest of the claim that the chip present transactions will be rejected as not a fraud due to the card being present. We can not prove the charges that were made online were made by the cardholder. They are saying that there are fraudulent transactions in between valid transactions made in another state. Again, how is this possible when the cardholder AND the card are in XXXX XXXX, CA when all of these charges took place? 
On XX/XX/XXXXWe asked for an explanation in writing as to why this claim was denied and on XX/XX/XXXX we received what we believe to be the fraud departments investigative report with no letter head, signature or indication that this sensitive information was from Bank of America. 
In this report their decision was that they were unable to conclude that fraud occurred. However, what about those transactions they ultimately concluded were fraud based on our own findings? 
The reasons for their conclusion were as follows : The 1st and 2nd ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX transactions claimed as fraud in a string of 42 transactions were XXXX miles from our cardholders home. Even though, the rest of the transactions were all in XXXX XXXX, NV where the cardholder can prove she was nowhere near. They claim that the credit card activity is not consistent with a lost or stolen card or a claim of counterfeit. 
Other reasons that they claim to have come to this conclusion are as follows, The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed that the customer authorized and signed for the transaction and left the store with the merchandise. How did they come to the conclusion that this was our cardholder? The signature does not match the cardholders. And furthermore, the signatures dont even match each other. 
Another reason they claimed was that the card had no declined charges after the account was closed, which they claimed suggested that the card user was aware of the account status. This is not a valid reason because the card was declined at some point due to suspicious activity, which is how we were alerted to begin with! 
Another reason was that the cardholder has 2 prior counterfeit claims the year prior, which honestly to us just proves that their system is not as safe as they claim. 
Lastly although, our cardholder provided evidence to prove she couldnt have been both in XXXX XXXX and in XXXX XXXX at the same exact timethis was not enough evidence to them. 
We immediately emailed our Bank of America Account Manager, XXXX XXXX to tell her about this document we received and asked to send even more evidence such as photos and personal credit card receipts issued in XXXX XXXX, CA to further prove that our cardholder was in XXXX XXXX, CA while these fraudulent charges occurred. XXXX XXXX did not respond to several emails about this until XX/XX/XXXX when she stated that unfortunately there was nothing that they could do at this point and that the case was now closed. We asked XXXX XXXX for the agreement of how Bank of America handled fraudulent activity claims with customers, so that our Legal Counsel could review and she gave us a phone number to call to obtain what she called XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and we were told by various agents that this document does not exist. We once again reached out to XXXX XXXX after making the calls to obtain the said fact sheet to let her know of this finding and to see if she could just send it to us and at this point, she has not responded to our emails or calls regarding this matter."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I signed up for a covid test at an XXXX airport for XX/XX/2021 when i planned to visit XXXX. There was no mention of a cancellation policy anywhere during booking. However, travel laws changed and I cancelled the test on XX/XX/XXXX. The company refused to refund the money, despite not using the services and cancelling almost 2 weeks prior. I disputed the charge as I never received the services and cancelled. Bank of America refused to do anything saying it was not fraud. At no point was there any mention of a cancellation policy and the bank needs to protect its customers from duplicitous companies."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXXI was informed via a phone call from Bank of America that my accounts with them may have been compromised. So I went into the local Bank of America branch in XXXX, Il. At that time I was told that there was an attempt to change my online account password and email address associated with my accounts. I had a money market account, checking account, and credit card with Bank of America at time. The employee then discovered that over {$13000.00} was transferred from my money market account to my checking account. Once that was completed about {$3000.00} from my checking account was wire transferred to a XXXX XXXX  account that was in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX. He then informed me that this person who lives in XXXX, GA at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was seen on camera entering a Bank of America branch in XXXX with an ID in my name and had obtained a debit card to my accounts. I was told to get the police involved so I filed a police report for Identity Theft with the XXXX PD. Then I had my accounts closed and reopened under different account numbers. This personal subsequently obtained the new account numbers so I was told to close out all of my accounts with Bank of America. In XX/XX/XXXXI went into the local Bank of America in XXXX, IL and closed out my checking, money market, and credit card accounts. I then assumed that everything was taken care of since I had been assured my the Bank of America fraud dept. that all the accounts were closed and could no longer be used by this person in Atlanta.
Now yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a collections agency stating that I owed {$1300.00} for an unpaid balance on my Bank of America credit card that was supposed to have been closed out in XX/XX/XXXX. So I was transferred to Bank of America 's fraud dept. who told me that this was not fraud since the account was opened by me in person on XX/XX/XXXX at my local Bank of America in XXXX, IL. I informed them that I indeed did have this credit card opened in XX/XX/XXXXbut that I closed out all my accounts with them in XX/XX/XXXX due to identity theft. I was then told that that could n't be the case because I just made a payment of {$1000.00} on this credit card in XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked them what address this credit card along with the statements was being mailed to. I was informed that it was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, GA XXXX. I told them that I lived in XXXX, IL which is about 12 miles east of XXXX XXXX, MO and that I have never resided in the state of Georgia. I also informed them that the lady who stole my identity lives at this address. They refused to believe me so I went into the local Bank of America today at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Il. I showed them my driver 's license, social security card, birth certificate, the police report filed in XX/XX/XXXX. I also gave them a copy the application that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me that proves that this lady at this address XXXX  has previous opened up a fraudulent credit card with them using my name, SSN, DOB, but at this same address in XXXX. I also informed them that this is about the 14th credit card that she has opened fraudulently in my name and that I have had to get closed. I have done all that I 've can on my part. I have filed police reports. I have a 7 year fraud alert with all 3 credit bureaus, I have a credit freeze but this still has not prevented this woman or man from opening up credit cards in my name. So I asked the bank manager how could this happen since I closed this credit card inXX/XX/XXXX for fraud. He told me that on XX/XX/XXXX that this person did a balance transfer of {$970.00} from a XXXX card to this closed Bank of America Cash Reward card and that this balance transfer is what reopened this closed account. Now mind you, I have previously had 3 Discover Cards closed that this person had opened in my name. I do n't know where to go from here. The XXXX PD says they have no jurisdiction in XXXX, GA and ca n't do anything. And the XXXX PD refuse to help me because I do n't live there even though I have give them this person 's address and all of the fraudulent accounts that have been opened and closed using my name, ssn, and dob."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America ( BoA ) is wrongfully refusing to process a "" return protection '' claim for a purchase made with my Premium Rewards credit card. BoA advertised this type of card as having "" return protection '' when I opened the account in XXXX and, as of XX/XX/XXXX, continues to do so. In addition, I had no trouble using the "" return protection '' benefit on this account in the past and have not received any notices from the bank that it would change in a way that affects the "" return protection '' benefit. 

I attempted to file a new "" return protection '' claim this week but have been unable to do so. It's not clear why. The four BoA representatives I spoke with each said that I would need to ask its benefit administrator, XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ). Yet XXXX says that the card does not have "" return protection. '' XXXX also said that it contacted the BoA this week and that BoA confirmed that the card does not have "" return protection. '' I have spent hours on calls going in circles with BoA and XXXX and reached a dead end. On these calls, the two entities have provided inconsistent and contradictory information. For example, multiple BoA representatives said my card does, in fact, still have "" return protection '' and confirmed that no "" change in terms '' notices were sent that would affect this. One of these representatives also promised to email me a copy of my card 's current terms but did not do so. XXXX says that it relies on BoA for information and that any concerns must be addressed by the bank. The bank, meanwhile, says that only XXXX can address benefit issues ( XXXX, a manager at BoA, both refused to help and said the matter couldn't be escalated further )."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied online for the Bank of America XXXX XXXX Signature Visa and all of the benefits that come with that specific card. I was instead automatically approved for an XXXX XXXX Visa Platinum plus card with a different annual fee and none of the benefits. Thinking this was a mistake, I applied again for the XXXX Visa Signature Card and the application went pending. I called BofA to see what was going on and they said they could approve me for the Visa Plat if i chose to. I chose not to but asked to have someone else look at my application for the Visa Signature card. He they asked if I consented to have my application reconsidered and i said yes. He then approved me for the other card, a Visa Platinum and claimed that I had never applied for the Visa Signature. I was escalated to a supervisor and she claimed my XXXX credit score and XXXX income did not qualify me for the Visa Signature and they decided to automatically approve me for a card that was not marketed at all on their application page. BAIT AND SWITCH. This is very deceptive. Definitely a UDAAP issue. I did some research online and there are HUNDREDS of other people who have complained about this same deceptive marketing practice. If you look at the link below, you will see advertising for ONLY the Visa Signature card and not the inferior yet still expensive Visa Platinum. There is no mention of the Platinum benefits or fees because they are inferior and nobody would apply knowing that they could be approved for the inferior card. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I never wanted the XXXX XXXX Visa Platinum with a {$50.00} annual fee and sub-par benefits . Nor did I apply for it. Yet somehow I was approved for TWO of them. I closed them but do not want them reported on my Credit Report."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello - In XX/XX/XXXX a 30 day late payment was erroneously listed on my credit report that lowered my credit score substantially.  Due to that error on my credit report, Bank of America lowered my credit limit on both of my credit cards.  I received emails onXX/XX/XXXX and letters dated XX/XX/XXXX informing me that BofA was lowering both of my credit limits.  I have been a loyal customer with BofA since XXXX   and have always paid all of my bills on time with them.  I recently had a battle with XXXX XXXX and I am very grateful to be cured.  However, I am working very hard to pay of debt and my credit limits are very important to me.  The error on my credit reports has been fixed and I called BofA thinking they would easily return me to my previous credit limits as the reason for they changed them was in error and was now remedied.  They refused to honor my request and I am frankly astonished.  I am a very good customer with an excellent payment history and I am thankfully recovering from a very serious illness.I sincerely appreciate any help you can give me in restoring my credit limits to their previous levels.  I hope to resolve this quickly and easily so we don't need to go to a campaign on social media to address this issue with BofA."

Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/2022 I used the service of XXXX XXXX to send money to family. The company gave me the option to draw directly from my savings or use a credit card or pay cash in a facility. I chose the credit card because XXXX XXXX offered a promo code to reduce their fee. Today when I paid my monthly credit card bill I noticed that my outstanding balance was higher than I anticipated. I called and was told that my XXXX XXXX transaction was classified as a cash advance. Bank of America had assessed a cash advance fee of {$43.00}. In addition interest accrued to over {$16.00} would be charged on my next statement. I immediately paid off the XXXX XXXX balance and requested that the fees be adjusted explaining that this was a service which I paid for using my card as a convenience. Not a cash advance. The representative refused. I closed my account. But I feel it is not fair to still have these fees pending. It is not made clear that this service is considered a cash advance. I pay my card off every month. I had multiple options to pay. I feel the charges are excessive and deceitfully charged
Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/2022 @ XXXXXXXX XXXX I received an email alert from XXXX for a hard credit inquiry for a credit card from Bank of America that I did not approve. I also received an email from Bank of America asking to confirm my email on a newly created account that I did not approve. I have tried to call both XXXX and Bank of America with no resolution.
Credit card or prepaid card,"We paid a credit card with Bank of America off on XX/XX/2021 ( {$3900.00} ). Yet somehow we were assessed a {$1.00} fee on XX/XX/2021. 

We called Bank of America to inquire about this {$1.00} charge, thinking it must be an error because the account balance was paid in full and the account had been closed. When we originally called them on XX/XX/XXXX, we were told that "" there was a server error, '' that we could not be helped at that time and should call back. 

We called again this evening ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and the first representative with whom we spoke told us again that "" there was a server error '' and to "" call back in a few hours. '' Given our previous experience, we were not satisfied with that answer and asked to be transferred. The next representative told us that a waiver had been submitted to have the {$1.00} charge removed from our account, and that it would take a few days to process. We have previously resolved erroneous fees on this account, and were not satisfied with the "" few days '' answer. So we requested to speak to another representative. 

The next representative ( the "" escalation manager '' ) said that "" nothing could be done, '' and that her supervisor was not available to help. She offered to put us in the customer service queue, and we were transferred to yet another representative. This individual stated that the charge was a system error that was applied and put us on hold. She then came back on the line, told us that the charge was valid, and explained that is was a "" minimum interest fee '' on XX/XX/2021. 

The account balance was {$0.00}. How can you charge interest on a {$0.00} account balance? 

This action feels predatory because when we paid off the account on XX/XX/XXXX, we were told that "" we were good, '' and to not expect any further transactions with Bank of America for this account. However, we were suspicious when we received an email weeks later saying that we had a statement ; how could we be issued a statement for an account that had been paid off? We checked, and saw the {$1.00} charge and began the process we just described to you. 

The predatory part is that, if we had not checked and seen the {$1.00} charge, there is no doubt in our mind that Bank of America would have charged us late fees for that charge. Not to mention the "" run around '' customer service experience. We spoke to six people before we got an actual answer! All for a charge that was placed on an account that had a {$0.00} balance! Again, how can you accrue interest on a {$0.00} balance? Not to mention that any late fees would have resulted in negative information on our credit report. 

Needless to say, this is not the first negative experience we've had with Bank of America. We will take our business elsewhere next time. 

A multi-billion dollar company that makes its money by nickel-and-diming ordinary Americans? It is a disgrace to the USA that they have America in their name."
Credit card or prepaid card,Bank of america was constantly closing my debit card which had money on it from XXXX when bank of america froze my account the first time. I recently received a letter from unemployment saying they would unfreeze my account if I verified my identity. So my account was unfroze in XXXX of XXXX. Well ever since I've had it I was constantly having to call B of A customer service to have them unlock my debit card. When I asked them why they kept on locking me out of my account they said it was a security procedure. Well then about a week ago a purchase i tried to make was declined so I called them once again and the said it was closed by the EDD. Well I tried to get some answers through the unemployment website and read that the EDD didn't have any control over the benefits once it is put on the bank of america debit card. That if an account was frozen then it had to of been bank of america.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, while checking over credit card transactions online and while I continue to be in a place where I am working long hours and have no cell phone service when I get home, I discovered two fraudulent transactions totaling {$190.00}. These transactions were in a state two states away from me and several hundred miles, and both fuel transactions, which is unlikely because it was more money per transaction than I ever use to fill a tank and also the two transactions occurred right around the same time meaning I wouldve filled the tank twice. 

I attempted to file a claim online and discovered that the bank wanted me to call. Since I couldnt call I found some advocacy sites that listed customer service email contacts. I emailed them to no avail. I then went on and found 45 XXXX  contacts. After a couple of emails, one person there got back with me saying that she had passed it on. 

In the days since, the bank sent me an email describing how I can go online and file a claim ( which was the same system that said that I have to call ). They also sent me an email saying that there was suspicious activity on my account and that I needed to verify transactions, to which I cooperated with only to find that I was being asked to verify a limited number of very recent transactions that werent fraudulent. After I went through the prompts on this, it reactivated my card. 

For lack of other options, I went online again and filed claims on the card based on saying that it was that I didnt get what I paid for instead of saying that it was a unauthorized transaction. In the text of the claims, I mentioned that these were unauthorized transactions. ( Unlike the unauthorized transactions claims, this type of claim can be done without phone calls XXXX. I received both mail and email confirmation of the claims. Strangely though, they just said that they were looking into it instead of saying that they had taken swift action to secure the card from further use by a fraudster. 

I also received an email from someone claiming to be in the Bank of Americas regulatory relations department, saying she was dealing with the issue. Though like everyone else, she did nothing substantive to deal with the issue as she hasnt taken any action to shut off the credit card and issue a new one or prosecute the claim for fraud. 

The bank also sent me an email copy of a letter they have sent me in the mail, asking me to proceed with the credit card claim by mail. Even though the credit card is obviously compromised and in the hands of fraudsters, they asked me to send them a claim by mail instead of taking action on the information they were given. 

47 people at Bank of America, including the XXXX XXXX department, executive customer service department, CEO, and other executives, have been notified of this matter and have taken action that has resulted in Bank of America replying ( and thereby confirming the receipt of these notifications XXXX. Yet more than a month after a claim was filed, they have done nothing to refund the transaction or even disable the credit card from being able to be used again by whoever has compromised it. 

Additionally, Better Business Bureau has been made aware of this issue and the bank has not responded to that complaint because theyre probably waiting right till the end of the 30 day window to reply. Instead of taking action that they were notified via yet another channel of fraud and a credit card that is at risk of further fraud."

Credit card or prepaid card,"In XXXX of 2022, I received a billing statement reversing a charge that I informed a banker that was not mine. I received a call from Bank of America with an agent stating that suspicious activity was noticed on my card and was issued a new card that was I never received. When I received the statement it showed the fraudulent charge removed and then it was reversed. I put in a claim for a fraudulent charge, but due to me also being a victim of mail theft did not receive the denial. When I did follow up with Bank of America, I let the banker know I did not receive the denial and that I had much evidence to share of my identity theft ( a police report number, postal inspector case number, FTC identity theft report, District Attorney complaint number, and other proof of my stolen identity. This was XX/XX/2022. A few days later I received a letter of denial of my claim on XX/XX/2022. It was obvious that the fraud department did not receive the evidence I sent to the XXXX XXXX site because I sent it on the XX/XX/2022.

I was told days after days of calling and being hung up on a few occasions their system were down and I needed to keep calling. Thats not my problem! I finally spoke to another agent who told me he had to send an email to his manager ( XX/XX/2020 ) and that the manager would submit the ACH claim. This was in XX/XX/2020! Check the records! I called a few weeks ago and was told that its in the system but that they were working on it. I havent received a call or letter and honestly I am tired of it!

If you call BOA, they will punish you. For a company to penalize you for asking a simple question it misleading, unfair and creates a freezing effect.

I tried to call the phone number to tell them the account was closed, but it asked for a credit card account number ( which I do n't have ) or a social security number ( which I input, but it did not recognize ). Since it did not accept my social security number, I got a recording that threatened "" extended wait times '' because I allegedly did not input my number. I got tired of being on hold and hung up. THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN CLOSED. I HAVE NO OPEN ACCOUNTS WITH BANK OF AMERICA."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I disputed an international transaction for tainted products purchased in XXXX, XXXX which only showed itself to be bad ( fuel ) after 24 hours. 

I disputed the claim with Bank of America, my credit card issuer. They gave me a time frame of less than ten days to get a "" qualified second opinion '' which had to come out of XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I signed the continuance letter provided by B of A saying I wanted the dispute to continue, but I needed more time to get the documentation from XXXX ( this is for XXXX diesel fuel ). The customer service agent assured me that I would be given an adequate amount of time for my expert second opinion. 

However, within 36 hours of filing the second opinion expert letters, my dispute was refused, ostensibly because the US Government had immutable guidelines on document presentation on disputes. Giving a consumer the short end of the response timeline in no way benefits the consumer, and in my particular case, it was daunting an onerous, since I had to deal with different nations and their work practices therein. I can not change the way XXXX America works, and I can not change COVID lockdowns. I made the bank aware that I would get the documentation they seek as soon as I was able ( it took ten days ). 

I find it unconscionable that the US government would favor the credit card company ( XXXX ) and the bank XXXX Bank of America ) with a 60 day investigation/response time yet provide the consumer with ten short days. 

I wish to dispute this resolution from B of A ( dispute case # XXXX ) in the amount of {$6100.00} USD and wish to have this artifice of a timeline for document review reset. I noticed B of A in good faith I needed more time to get the documents from XXXX, and they acknowledged as much."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for the Bank of America Small Business credit card on XX/XX/2018 for my Sole Proprietorship that I just started. I filled out the application selecting Sole Proprietorship as the business type. I did not receive a decision at that time and later received a letter dated XX/XX/2018 requesting more information. 

This letter requested proof of business, verification of legal structure, year end business financial statements and tax returns. They gave me one month to provide this information. They also disclosed my credit score as XXXX, establishing there is no credit issue. As a newly established sole proprietorship, I do not have many of the items they requested as they do not exist and are not required for my type of business. I provided the information that I did have, such as my tax returns, along with explanation of why the other information was not available nor applicable. 

I think received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, denying my application. This is before the 30 days I was given to produce the information. The reason for denial was insufficient information on the business bureau- which is not required for a Sole Proprietorship - and business credit references have not been established for a sufficient length of time - which is  discriminatory in nature against new businesses, even those such as mine with excellent credit."

I'm on automatic bill pay ( recurring payments ). Since I'm using this service I don't check my statements. I do not review my statements every month due to the fact I know what I'm spending. All they had to do was contact me and explain that there was going to be an increase in my monthly bill. Instead of contacting me they began charging late fees. If I was notified I would have immediately made the adjustment to my recurring payment total. I do receive a email each month that I have a credit card statement. Same as my other credit card provider. The only reason I had checked my credit card statement was because I received a different email "" Account alert '' that is when I noticed the fees being charged."

A police report was filed within the hour but we could not catch them at the store. All credit card companies were aware these were fraudulent charges within that first hour or so. All have been great with the exception of Bank of America. They initially reversed the charge on XX/XX/XXXX. THEN on XX/XX/19 they charged it backto my account and denied the claim the reason is that I shop at that store ( well yes it's 5 minutes from my house! ). and that made it a valid charge. Are you kidding me? Since then i have reopened the claim on XX/XX/19 ( closed during holiday ). They have all the police information etc. and still have not accepted the claim.

Credit card or prepaid card,"BofA has an overly aggressive security system. It has been declining charges that are regularly recurring monthly charges, as well as one-time charges.

For the entire month of XXXX, XXXX, BofA has been denying a regularly recurring charge for XXXX, which has my website and generates business for me. XXXX threatened me with account closure on XX/XX/XXXX for non-payment, so I paid the balance due today with another credit card. When I changed the payment method, XXXX said that BofA has closed my account. BofA has not notified me of the account 's closure, and has no valid reason for closing my account. When I call BofA, the Security Dept rep says that the account can not be accessed by the rep unless the rep can text a code to my telephone number on file. My telephone number on file is the landline for my business- it can not receive text messages. So I can not tell the rep what the code is, and the rep says that he/she can not access my account. It is a vicious and ridiculous cycle. The telephone reps sound like robots, and state that it will not do any good to speak with a supervisor because BofA will not allow a supervisor to access my account either. The only remedy they can come up with is to go into a branch. We do not have a BofA branch in my county, and the reps tell me that BofA will not reimburse me for 4 hour ( roundtrip ) to another county just to go into a branch to prove my identity."

The bank says the chip on my card was read for this transaction and that is not possible since my car is always kept in my safe box and I only take it out when I travel to the USA. Im completely sure that no one had access to my card. I requested a copy on the vouchers for this transactions and I finally received them yesterday, and verified that the signature on this vouchers are not my signature and are very different from the signature I have registered at the bank, also the personal ID number on the voucher is not mine either.

Considering the amount on this transactions the merchant must have requested a valid ID at the moment of running the card and they should have verified if name on ID matched name on card. Also according to the security benefits the bank offers on credit cards they block transactions with abnormal behavior. This is a perfect example, first because the card was being charged by an overseas merchant for the first time and second the amount of more than  XXXX   XXXX  dollars for each transaction is not normal and the bank didn'tt block this transactions. With the facts Im providing you, should be enough reason to consider this transactions as fraud but the bank for the second time does not consider so. I have reopened my fraud complain with the bank for the third time with all this arguments with no intentions to reimburse me the amount charged on this transactions.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Subject : XXXX XXXX Bank of America Credit Card XXXX XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my recent experience with Bank of America and the revocation of my credit card rewards without a proper explanation. I believe that my rights as a consumer have been violated, and I seek your assistance in resolving this matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ], I received notification from Bank of America stating that my credit cards were cancelled & when I tried to use my rewards it didnt let me when I reached out to them I was told that was there policy and they can not give more explanation.However, despite multiple attempts to seek clarification, I have not received a satisfactory explanation for this action. As a long-standing customer of Bank of America , I have always fulfilled my obligations and maintained a good credit history. 

I am deeply concerned about the lack of transparency and communication surrounding the cancellation of my cards & rewards. I have diligently accumulated these rewards through my regular card usage, and their revocation without a valid reason has significantly impacted my trust in Bank of America as a financial institution. 

I also have all my wealth management retirement accounts with them. And that really makes me think how I should trust a institution like this. I used these cards to pay for my child classes and regular daily gas groceries etc. 

I have attempted to resolve this matter directly with Bank of Americas customer support, but I have not received a satisfactory response or a clear understanding of why my rewards were revoked. Given the circumstances, I believe it is appropriate to involve a regulatory authority like the CFPB to ensure a fair resolution. 

I kindly request that the CFPB thoroughly investigate this issue and intervene on my behalf to rectify the situation. I seek an explanation for the revocation of my credit card rewards and appropriate restitution if it is determined that Bank of America has acted in error or violated any consumer protection regulations. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and your commitment to protecting consumer rights. I look forward to a prompt and fair resolution of this complaint. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

My address in the XXXX is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. My address in XXXX is : # XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

My card was lost/stolen back in XXXX/XXXX when I was visiting XXXX. I requested a replacement card, but never received it in the mail. Since BofA credit card was not really the card that I primarily used, and I was very busy at the time, I did not notice that I never received the card in the mail. However, and I really have no idea how, somebody has been able to log into my online accounts during this time, change mailing addresses, receive the card in person, and go make fraudulent transactions at jewelry stores and electronic stores. It was only after I talked to the police and filed a report for the claims that I realized my ID had also been forged and I have been a victim of full-blown identity fraud as well ... Somebody has created a fake ID with my name and information, while posting their face on the ID. The police report information is as follows : Police Report # XXXX - XXXX/Officer XXXX/Badge # XXXX The fraudster has done this with my account/credit card 3 times and I have filed a claim for each occurrence : Claim ID # XXXX [ closed/claim was declined without anyone from BofA calling me or asking me for more information ] Claim ID # XXXX [ Still being researched ] Claim ID # XXXX [ Still being researched ] Two of the claims are still being researched, however, one of them ( Claim ID # XXXX ) has just recently been declined, and my account has been charged for the fraudulent amount of $ XXXX. Nobody from BofA has called me to ask for more information or to inquire about how all of this has happened. They have just "" determined '' that these charges are not fraudulent. I am really scared that the other two claims might also get declined in a similar fashion, since the stolen amounts are really large, and I end up being held liable for $ XXXX stolen from me. 

Since the claims, I have filed a police report, put an identity theft alert on my credit reports/accounts, have changed all my User IDs/Passwords/Mailing Addresses, etc. so that this does not keep happening, and I have finally received my BofA credit card in mail, and have put it in a safe box, only using it electronically via XXXX XXXX to make purchases. The police has not been able to catch the fraudster yet, but I really hope they do so. What has occurred here is really devastating. 

According to law, I must not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions made with the card, if reported promptly. Right now, I am really scared that BofA might decline all of these 3 claims and I end up being held liable for $ XXXX in purchases that I did not make. Please help me with these claims, and closely monitor them, so that this does not happen. I will provide you with as much information as you need. If there is any document I need to sign, I will do so. Please just do not randomly decline the claims, due to their large amounts, and since it is convenient to do so ... I am really scared regarding the results of these claims, and according to law, I should be protected. Please help me.

The woman on the phone kept deliberately calling me the wrong name and telling me they no longer offer that option despite it being listed on BOA 's website and then hung up on me.

This to me is clear evidence that they no longer wanted to honor their cash back rewards portion of the agreement."

Credit card or prepaid card,"The following Complaint has been filed in correlation to a Consumer Protection Act in which its general provisions have been violated with respect to Commerce and Trade Practices for which this Agency maintains the regulation and enforcement of a substantial rule or policy for which one or more offenses has occurred hereunder.

Please take notice that this Complaint will be retained in receipt confirmation thereof and any correspondence to or from this Agency as it relates to this matter or any investigation may be used or adopted within a governing agency or within a court of competent jurisdiction in seeking a permanent injunction and equitable remedy to grant consumer relief for all liability and damages suffered. 

This action and subsequent claims arises in pertinent part out of specific breach of duty and offenses which have violated legislative ordinances and consumer protection policies of : Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act ( CCPA ), Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), Federal Office of the Comptroller of Currency ( OCC ). 

Consumer and Petitioner of this Complaint ; a long-term outstanding Client and Cardholder of Bank of America N.A., maintained ( 2 ) open line-of-credit accounts ( Credit Cards ) and other accounts within the institution. The relationship between Bank and within all accounts was maintained under full satisfactory order and all accounts current and paid-in-full as agreed. Beginning on or about XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, Cardholders account was in part assessed multiple inaccurate charges that consisted of : fraudulent charges, contractual billing errors, deceptive or unethical business practices, improper reversal of fees and charges, failure to post credits and refunds on the account thereof. Upon recognition of such errors and discrepancies and pursuant to the rules and procedures of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), Cardholder immediately took affirmative action to dispute all improper  charges and fees. However, Bank of America allowed for numerous violations within the law to occur and failed to follow the procedures for handling Credit Card Disputes. The account was then made subject to penalties in the form of late fees and interest related charges, which were assessed on the account thereof with each forthcoming billing cycle. Contributing to further violations that was prohibited under a substantial policy or act was the pursuit of an invalid debt and all collection attempts there-under. Bank of America was unwilling to resolve these disputes and as a result began terminating the open line-of-credit accounts held by Cardholder and by XX/XX/XXXX all credit accounts were permanently closed and terminated. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX Cardholder reached a settlement agreement between a Merchant that was not previously in dispute at any time within the institution. This agreement would provide compensation and restitution by means of a refund to Cardholders closed account thus releasing parties of further obligations. Without the consent or knowledge of Cardholder and despite closure on the account and inability to access account ; Bank of America processed such refund and the transfer of all such amounts in their benefit to offset the total accrued charges that remained in dispute and their related fees in an effort to satisfy the ongoing disputes and their respective disputed amounts. Moreover, the negative and improper reporting of a debt continues to remain in effect within the records of the Credit Reporting Bureaus which has caused severe damage by the impairment of Consumers Credit History. This reporting action to ( CRA ) resulted in the denial of all applications seeking new line-of-credit. Bank of America has failed to resolve all matters of dispute under proper venue and regulation under the aforementioned Consumer Protection Acts and refuses to rectify all other outstanding significant matters. 

The actions of Bank of America have and continue to adversely affect consumer and caused financial injury, damages and loss. A civil action is set to be filed within a court of competent jurisdiction seeking relief and judgment against Bank of America for committing numerous violations within consumer protection policies and statutory law. Your cooperation in thoroughly investigating such claims of relevant material that pertain in part or in whole to this agency are of utmost importance as this action and future proceedings may necessitate this agencies future involvement and participation in this matter.

Supporting documentation showing cause-of-action and such direct violation within the applicable law will be provided to this Agency upon requested to Petitioner. If you have any further questions or concerns please refer to the contact information that has been provided within this claim process."

I am quite upset and frustrated about this event and feel like I got scammed by the representative / BOA.

This time when I notified Bank Of America of the additional fraudulent activity, I was told they probably gave XXXX XXXX my new credit card information which doesn't make any sense to me. They told me to contact the vendor, XXXX XXXX, to resolve even though I never dealt with them before. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX through email & she cancelled the fraudulent account that some one set up with my credit card information. She said she couldn't credit me for the {$200.00} fraudulent charge because a package was sent to me even though I never ordered or received anything. She told me to notify Bank Of America of the fraudulent charge, which I did.

These efforts also create a hostile and chilling climate for the exercise of Second Amendment rights, particularly for those of us hoping to obtain financing for such things as home and auto purchases or running a small business. Once financial institutions take it upon themselves to set social policy that exceeds the requirements of the law, its impossible to know where they will stop or what other indicators of disfavored activity might become relevant to them.

It should be noted here, that when Bank of America finally responded to the original complaint and said it needed more time, it knew at that time that my credit card was at risk of further fraud, as is evidenced by its receipt of the information and responding to the CFPB by asking for more time. They were fine with leaving my credit card on and subject to more fraud. And then after that they started declining my purchases at every single place I go to, including stores that I frequently go to while they still have bot honored the fraud claim. So theyre just enriching themselves and retaliating against me. They should be refunding my fraud claim but they wont and now they are retaliating. This is a new complaint about the retaliation."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, I am writing today about a problem I am having with Bank of America Corporation ( BofA ). This problem involves a balance transfer as well as a credit limit reduction. I have very carefully managed my credit over the years with FICO8 scores consistently in the 700s. I have never missed a payment, or been late. I will explain in more detail below, but I believe BofA has engaged in a bait-and-switch business practice and I would like help resolving this, if at all possible. 

On both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I took advantage of an offer that BofA had advertised on both of my accounts for a 0 % 12 month promotional APR balance transfer with a 3 % balance transfer fee. My intent was to get some relief from credit card debt and work to pay off my balance over the year. I took out balance transfers that amounted to ~49 % ( including the 3 % fee ) of my available credit limit with the bank. For the next 3-4 months, I redirected funds to pay down other higher interest debt. I still have never been late on a payment or missed one and do not intend to ever. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice from XXXX credit monitoring that my credit limit had decreased on one of my cards - this was my first BofA card. I immediately checked my online account to find that BofA had cut my credit limits by more than 50 % and that I now had only ~ {$100.00} of available credit on each card. My utilization on both cards had spiked to 95 %. I immediately called the bank to verify this change and request a reinstatement of my credit limit but was told this would result in a hard inquiry and opted against it. 

Wary that this may spark a chain reaction with other financial institutions at a critical junction in my financial recovery, I realized I must pay this balance down almost immediately. FICO   models do not provide a history of utilization and any financial institution that saw a 95 % utilization would possibly take the same steps. I spent the next week figuring out how to pay down my cards with BofA and borrowed on a line of credit I have with my credit union at 10-11 % to do so. In total I had to pay down approximately {$4500.00} of my balances 7-8 months earlier than I was expecting to. 

After this had settled, I resolved to contact BofA on/around XX/XX/XXXX and request a partial refund of the balance transfer fees that I had paid ( {$310.00} total was paid ). My reasoning is that I was promised 12 months of 0 % APR financing in exchange for a 3 % fee. At no point did BofA revoke my 0 % APR, however, if I had not paid my balance down I would potentially have incurred significant financial harm with my other financial institutions. I had no choice as a responsible user of credit but to pay the balance transfer back. As such, I did not receive the full value of the 0 % APR as promised. The phone representatives at BofA attempted, but the computer system did not permit a reduction in this type of fee. 

I understand that Bank of America is normally within their rights to reduce credit limits. My complaint is that the timing and severity of the reduction, coupled with the consistent marketing of 0 % offers results in a deceptive practice that amounts to essentially a bait-and-switch for all those who care about their credit. 

Best, XXXX"

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a serious concern about BOA and how it's protection process to the unauthorized charges and ID theft on customer 's account. I have been reaching out the the fraud department as well as provide several evidences showing the transactions on the stolen credit cards are unauthorized. BOA has never reach out nor provided helpful assistance when I called in. The members in the fraud department are super unprofessional and irresponsible, they requested responses from me a minute before closing the claim and hurrying me to pay the unauthorized balance. I am serious asking my lawyer to prepare legal document against BOA 's unprofessional behavior. Below are the evidence to the ID theft transactions. 

I am writing this letter in response to claim number XXXX associated with credit card # XXXX. Upon receiving the decision letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, along with the information, the merchant provided claim # XXXX. I am providing you with some information to prove that the total amount of {$7200.00} is unauthorized and associated with identity theft. My wallet was stolen on XX/XX/XXXX. I first noticed it when I returned to work from lunch in XXXX XXXX and received text messages from BOA indicating two transactions from XXXX ( {$3600.00} each ). And I wanted to call BOA 's number on the back of the credit card, but I then found out my wallet had been stolen. Both unauthorized transactions were made at the same time. I called BOA immediately to report the loss. There is one drivers license, one BOA credit card, {$50.00} cash, and a couple of business cards in the wallet. I've opened the claim with BOA twice. The second claim, I even provide solid evidences to prove the information merchant provided is associate to the identity theft activity by the thief, including 1. IP address is not mind, 2. the email address is associated to old account that was expose to ID theft and already been discontinued. 3. I do not recognize the foreign language the merchant provided. 4. The merchant proclaimed that the transactions is for a XXXX game. I have never been to XXXX, and all XXXX games need to be downloaded when a user physically in XXXX. Therefore, it is impossible for me to make the transactions. 5. The thief signed a handwriting form with my driver 's license and credit card in a photo. It is easy to do so with anyone who stole my wallet. However, the signature and handwriting are not match myself. BOA should had my signature on file, but lack of the responsibility to verify it but asking my to be responsible to the transactions the thief made. 6. Not to mention the thief signed as XXXX, which I never used this name. I have provided all documents ( including ID theft report, police report, statements against the merchant 's evident in details with image attached ) and faxed them over to XXXX, but BOA seems never looking into what customers provided rather than urging themselves to get the money. This is the third time I attempted to make the complaint peacefully, and I would choose let my attorney speaks for me next time if BOA continues neglecting to verify the true information but being inclined to the merchants even the evidences from the customers are soiled."

Credit card or prepaid card,"So I had previously filed a complaint against Bank of America for arbitrarily lowering my credit limit from {$7000.00} to {$4000.00} and reporting late payments to the credit bureaus even though I had in fact made monthly payments ( XXXX ). Surprise, surprise when a bank investigates themselves, they don't seem to find any wrongdoing! 

As a follow up to this in XXXX, I paid off the majority of my balance, leaving me with approximately {$400.00} of my {$4000.00} limit. 

Though I probably shouldn't be surprised at this point, this audacious institution committed another egregious act against my credit report XXXX on my birthday ), and lowered my credit limit from {$4000.00}, to {$500.00}, taking my reported usage from 10 % to 90 %! So let 's review! 

XXXX. Consumer illustrates ability to pay off over 80 percent of balance in spite of previous damage done to credit report done by Bank of America 2. Consumer is 'rewarded ' by having credit limit reduced and as a result, reported usage skyrockets from 10 % to 90 % When will the consumer finance protection bureau finally step in and take action against this shameless institution?!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Here is the last email that I sent to Bank of America after visiting their office and I got no assistance. 

Hello XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, if you will recall, I was in your office on Friday regarding a BOFA credit card that I opened online ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) in XXXX and it was CLOSED by BOFA because fraud was suspected in opening the account. After many phone calls to try to resolve it over the phone, I was told that I had to go to an actual branch in person with 2 forms of ID to get it RE-OPENED. Since there is no branch where I live for the summer in West Virginia, I had to travel 130 miles each way to your branch in XXXX XXXX Once I got there and produced my passport and driver license, I was under the impression that the credit card would be RE-OPENED ( unfrozen ) and I would be able to use it. That did not happen!!!!! 

First I want to remind you that I have been a customer with BOFA for over 38 years!! I can not even begin to tell you how frustrated and disappointed with the service I have been offered in regards to this matter. I am seriously considering closing all of my accounts with BOFA and going to a bank who really cares about their customers ( if there is such a bank! ). 

I opened the XXXX credit card for the immediate benefits is would offer me on my upcoming cruise. With any purchase over {$500.00}, I would be given a {$100.00} credit on my account. That was done. In addition to that, once I made at least {$1000.00} in purchases, I would be given XXXX points ( equal to {$200.00} ) to be used on my cruise. 

Due to BOFA not assisting me to reopen that card, even after it was proven that there was no fraud and I am who I said I was, I will not get the {$200.00}. So in addition to the cost of the gas that I had to use to get to your branch and back on Friday, ( about {$40.00} ) and spending the entire day in the car or at your office, BOFA has cost me money!! 

If a fraudulent charge is made to an existing credit card, you would close that card out and re-issue a new card to me and transfer the balance to the new account if there was one. Why could that not have happened on Friday??????? 

I called BOFA again this morning to try to get this resolved and my only option was to apply for a new card. How is that going to look on my credit report????? I opened a new card ( NCL ) in XXXX with BOFA and was given a {$13000.00} credit line, then ... ... just a few weeks later, it was CLOSED by BOFA. That can not look good. I have excellent credit and need someone from BOFA to notify the credit reporting agencies of what has transpired. 

What a pity that all anyone at BOFA has done for me so far is to apologize for my "" inconvenience ''. It is much more than an inconvenience. It is poor customer care! Actions speak louder than words and I have seen no action. 

Do you have a solution to my problem?????? If so, I would like to hear from you, if not, I do not want to hear any more apologies. 

Sincerely,"

I'm not able to reach him after I made the payment, and the seller 's XXXX  account was deleted after the transaction. 

I filed a claim to dispute this transaction with Bank of America and they denied saying it's XXXX 's responsibility to help with the chargeback. However, I did contact XXXX before I filed the dispute and they asked me to contact BOA and think I would be able to get my money back."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been with Bank of America for a long time, and I have always appreciated the good value and service I have received from Bank of America. Back in XXXX of XXXX  I checked my credit report and notice a mistake. I was devastated to see a late payment show up. In immediately called in to BOA and spoke with a representative. I explained to the rep that in XX/XX/2022 I paid my account in full and set up automative payments with an online rep assisting me with the process. The representative ask what server did I use because sometimes their system glitches when using XXXX, I was unaware and ask why wasn't that explained to me when I set it up. The rep said she will make a note on my account and remove the late payment. However 30 days went by and the late payment was never removed from my report. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with another rep in which she assured me that my account will be updated. The rep provide me with an reference # XXXX. Again nothing was done. All XXXX credit bureaus still had the late payments. I called back on XX/XX/2022. I spoke with another rep with reference # XXXX. The representative assured me that she will have my account updated immediately. I called all 3 credit bureaus today and they all responded that they have no letter from Bank of America regarding the late payments. I have a perfect record paying on time. This is really an inconvenience, and a violation of my consumer rights."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am a credit account holder with Bank of America Visa. I have made earlier complaint on about XX/XX/2022 to CFPB regarding this matter. 

I would like to notify that Bank of America has yet to cancel the disputed charges, and is still now permitting additional fraudulent charges to accrue. I have received one telephone call, directing me to phone them at ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX from a XXXX XXXX at extension XXXX however this number again refused the extension number I was given in a voice message. I am extremely concerned by the refusal to acknowledge my clear notifications of these fraudulent charges. 

This practice place me in an impossible position, as I can neither discuss this with Bank of America or stop the charges. I have sent another certified letter to Bank of America with this same complaint."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXX a merchant fraudulently charged Bank of America my credit card for unapproved services in the amount of amount of {$11000.00}. I immediately alerted Bank of America regarding the transaction which followed a series of back and forth investigation.

Since then the issue remains unresolved despite efforts on my part to get the matter resolved fairly.

Instead of investigation the matter, Bank of America unilaterally started reporting my account to the credit agencies for default on payments despite the fact that i continued to contact the company and share documents related to the dispute. All this time, i continued to make minimum payments on legitimate balances that i felt i should have been paying pending the dispute resolution. 
Other than the disputed transaction, I have had no any other credit issues on record. But the action by Bank of America has has had the greatest impact on my then excellent credit rating, causing denial of credit and loan applications The bank is now claiming that because of the default they have closed the account and that they are going to charge off the account at the end of XX/XX/XXXX."
Credit card or prepaid card,I am filing a complaint on Bank of America cause I have had an ongoing dispute on some fraud charges done to my corporate card for XXXX XXXX XXXX. They have denied my fraud claim on grounds that are not valid. They have requested me to explain to them details of the claim that I have no recollection on because of the length of the charges I have explained to them on several occasions that I do not recall and they continue to insist on my giving them dates that I do not recall events on. After going through responses on the paperwork they have sent in response to several complaints filed I have filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX sherrif. I did request a card and activated the card before changing my number XXXX to XXXX and the charges started days later on the account. They claim I made phone calls verifying charges XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX but that was not me. They claim that my Drivers license was provided and I did not have any type of communication with them during those dates. I am providing them with a copy of the police report and requesting my right with the fair and accurate credit transactions act to reconsider my claim. They have removed monies from my checking accounts with them to pay for charges that are fraudulent and this is not something that I will be letting go even if it needs to go in front of a judge in civil court.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Even though I pay my bills on time and had almost an XXXX credit score a year ago, I have been trying to refinance and got trapped in a XXXXXXXX XXXX  predatory lending loop. 

I qualified for a $ XXXX HELOC loan back in XX/XX/XXXX and the funds were transferred to my account. Immediately after and continuing for the rest of the year, I kept dealing with bouts of fraud on other accounts owned by XXXX XXXX  so I decided to move my direct deposit paycheck to Bank of America. 

Right around that time, my employer of 8 years, out of the clear blue sky, accused me of "" acting erratic ''. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. She spent the next eight months trying to get me institutionalized and declared XXXX so she could continue to defraud my bank account ( XXXX ). 

I was not aware until recently that she had been fraudulently collecting tax monies, writing checks from my bank account, and, after terminating me, while I struggle to get unemployment, I watched a paycheck get accidentally deposited into my bank account ... only to watch Bank of America WITHDRAW the check for my former boss and give it back to her. 

I've called Bank of America many times and asked why someone else 's phone number is on my bank account for verification. The reps tell me they will remove it and when I log into online banking it is still there. The number that does not belong to me is ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

I took this phone number briefly when my original phone number was stolen back on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX... that phone number was XXXX. I've noticed that I can not disconnect XXXX XXXX from my longtime email XXXX and I think some of the fraud with the phone numbers and the online verifications with those numbers is happening through XXXX XXXX because when I lost my original phone number, I wasn't able to get into my long time email, XXXX. 

I had been upgrading my phone at XXXX and explained that I was simply ugrading, and needed just a new phone, same phone number. The employee took my phone to the back of the store and when he came back, I assumed my number had not changed. In a few hours, after returning home, I realized that he had changed my number and taken my SIM card. 

I tried to get my phone number back for the next 89 days and finally did. After that I was finally able to log into over 10 years worth of emails. I was even able to get into an old account that had been used by the phone number thief who had used a burner phone service and a XXXX account I'd created to steal my identity. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, both XXXX XXXX  and Bank of America closed my checking accounts on the same day. XXXX XXXX  took away my deposit accounts, making it more difficult for me to transfer funds in to pay my mortgages ( which I'm trapped into anyway because of the HELOC that is on my credit report that they JUST FINALLY gave to me after taking it away for 8 months ) and Bank of America closed my deposit accounts, and left me with some oddly high ( $ XXXX ) credit card bills and proof that someone had been writing checks with my account and likely laundering money through both my XXXX XXXX  and XXXX Bank of America accounts. I was unemployed in XXXX but somehow over {$11000.00} passed through my BoA account. 

When I leave the XXXX branch, I always get a phone call and an offer of help from XXXX, XXXX of the bankers who works there, but it's only by text or a hang up call and no help is offered. The same thing happened the day I most recently changed my phone number, the woman who helped me set up my phone had test called me and she then called me later that night and hung up. 

I complained to CFPB about XXXX XXXX  and their violations of the FCRA and Homebuyers'/Homeowners ' rights and after XXXX XXXX promises of help from XXXX XXXX, XXXX finally gave me the money that was mine originally for my HELOC loans. 

I'm circling the drain here with B of A because I've asked for copies of my credit card statements multiple times and they have not been sent to me. I've called multiple times and asked them to remove XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX from my bank account, because it is not my phone number anymore. The most change I've received is the old phone number getting LOCKED as the permanent number to use for verification because the "" owner '' of it ( most likely my HR director from my old job who had all of my PII, XXXX XXXX -- I found her login info in my Apple Keychain ) had transferred over {$10000.00} into or out of the account, and I know I have never moved that much money in or out of that account, so this other number gets to be the # 1 phone number to call to validate the account. It doesn't even matter if I go into a branch with my passport, driver license, birth certificate, and US mail addressed to me, if I can't get a ping on my phone when the banker sends me a text, I am refused help.

This has been happening for nearly a year now. When I call on the phone I get transferred from department to department, sitting on the phone for hours. I can't get any information as to who took out checks on my account. I can't get any clarification or proof of the direct deposit blunder because my deposit accounts have been closed. 

I think I am being denied unemployment because my employer is still listing me as employed and collecting my paycheck. Is there a way to check this? 

I worked as an Administrative Officer at the Supreme Court of Ohio from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. When I was terminated for "" being tardy '' on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, of XXXX, had all of my personal belongings from my office shipped to her home so that she could go through them with a fine toothed comb. I have proof of it from XXXX. 

She then planted checks from XXXX bank into my belongings that had my name and the Supreme Court XXXX Ohio 's address on them. She removed one of the checks, check number XXXX, I believe. I had started a case against the Supreme Court with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but despite showing them clear proof that I deserved and desperately needed whistleblower protection, I was ignored. In her testimony to the board, XXXX XXXX noted that her actions towards me were not "" due to the fact that I hold any particular fiduciary powers for the Supreme Court of Ohio ''. 

So not only is this woman trying to rip me off and then write me off as crazy, she's literally coming up with the worst plot twists with tons of holes in her story and calling me a "" federal fiduciary '', essentially. What she's doing is so crazy, I can't get anyone to even investigate it or represent me. 

Can you please look into my Bank of America accounts? 

My info : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX old number that is connected to the Bank of America account and I believe is now used by my old HR manager : ( XXXX ) XXXX I can't find exacting proof of this, but it has been suggested to me that XXXX XXXX has leased a car with my credit. I did notice a spike in my debt to income ration about a year ago. I am close to {$600000.00} in "" debt '' due to student loans and the fact that I own two {$300000.00} homes but just two years ago, I owed about $ XXXX or so less. If she's leasing an auto with a bank I don't use, I'd never see the paperwork. 

The ID theft is getting so bad, I am thinking of appealing to the SSA for a new SS #. 

Please contact me at XXXX or ( XXXX ) XXXX or you can write to me at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ohio XXXX"

But definitely I didn't give my card to anyone and I had not been the place where the transcaiton happened. 

I think the reason may be that my card was lost XXXX months ago, and I got a replaced one with the same number. So I wonder whether the lost card still could be used."
Credit card or prepaid card,My credit card was charged for a purchase on the value of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. The purchase was made on XXXX XXXX. I received a text from BofA about a suspicious purchase on my card. I called them right away to cancel the purchase. They put a fraud dispute and after 2 months decided that I did not win the dispute and I will have to pay for that purchase that I did not make because the hackers used my address as well as my card number. All I know is that I didnt purchase anything and on the day and time I received the text I was at my job at a Hospital and my card on my pocketbook. I have my coworkers to testify of what happened.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I requested an online wire transfer payment through Bank of Americas Online Bill Pay service for my Company Credit Card on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1200.00}.

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX in the morning the transfer was completed from by business checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, when checking the BofA Business Credit Card transactions this payment has not been posted. Upon calling BofA Customer Support they say they see the payment in Online Bill Pay but dont expect this payment to post until Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. This is both frustrating and maddening that {$1200.00} from my business is floating in the ether and is inaccessible for my business. This is absolutely unacceptable and BofA is either incapable or uninterested in appropriately handling my business funds. As far as customer support escalations I was offered to submit my complaint via the customer feedback survey. Which has no ability to appropriately fix this lack of oversight or control of funding in a timely fashion."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Hi! 

My account was closed without warning and I have since been unable to redeem the XXXX points that are still listed on the account. 

These points are worth {$740.00} in cash that I should be able to redeem with a direct deposit when the account was facing closure and I was not given the option. Now I can log in and see them but not redeem them. 

I have tried to reach out over the years and have been stonewalled."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a VISA credit card with Bank of America that I set up to use auto-pay, which is their system for setting your checking account to automatically pay off the statement balance on the credit card each month. I had it set up to pay the full statement balance by the earliest delivery date. When choosing the earliest delivery date option, their system requires you to set an amount limit. If the statement balance is over the amount limit the auto-pay will not pay off any of the balance until you log in to your account. 

I logged in to my account and saw that my balance was much higher than it should be, {$810.00}. I discovered this was because my last statement balance was {$500.00}, over the {$500.00} limit I set, so it was never auto-payed, and then additional charges I made brought it up to {$810.00}. The credit card only has a {$500.00} credit limit, so it shouldn't have been able to go above the auto-pay limit in the first place. If I hadn't happened to log in to my account at the right time, I would have assumed auto-pay was working and missed a credit card payment. 

This system seems designed to lure unsuspecting customers into missing payments and accruing interest. By forcing you to set up an auto-pay limit and also allowing you to go above the credit limit on you card, they lull you into a false sense of security that your autopay will always go through as planned when in fact it won't."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, it was my intention to fully repay the balance on my Bank of America Credit Card account. I initiated an online payment to pay the balance in full, with a payment in the amount of {$3400.00}. I had some issue making that payment, so I was not sure if the transaction was completed. I did not see the transaction in the transaction history, so, I initiated it again. 

The next day, on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that two debits in that amount had cleared my checking account. I proceeded to have one of the debits in my account returned so that the - {$3400.00} balance on my credit card would be XXXX 'd out. 

The following day, that was completed, but upon inquiry about the availability of funds, I was told that there would be a 10 day hold on my accocunt, despite the fact that the amount had cleared my checking account, and, I had NO history of late payments or returned checks on the account. NONE. 

I had multiple conversations and emails with Bank of America. I explained to them that I wanted the availability on my account so that I could use a promotional 0 % interest rate offer that was listed on my account. The promotion stated that the offer was good through XXXX XXXX  so, I gave up and figured I would have to wait the 10 days, which would get me the funds available around XXXX XXXX  well before the XX/XX/XXXX expiration of the offer. 

Well, it was a mistake to mention this, because despite the fact that the promotion stated I had until XXXX XXXX  when I signed in today ( XX/XX/ ) the promotional offer was rescinded. I am certain this was retaliation for my complaining about the TOTALLY unfair and unwarranted hold that was placed on my account. 

I attempted to get the offer reinstated, but Bank of America refused. 

I have been a banker for almost 40 years. I have excellent credit and income. I understand how payments are processed, and I know that ACH transactions CLEAR THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY. Bank of America demonstrated VERY poor customer service by not immediately reinstating my availability. I welcomed them to verify with my bank ( where I work ) that the payment had cleared, similar to how XXXX XXXX handles this. They refused. 

I decided to live with it, but now that they PUNISHED me be rescinding the promotional offer, that was good until XX/XX/XXXX, I feel the bank should be punished and formally reprimanded. And, the promotional offer should be reinstated."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This is regarding my BOA Visa Card - XXXX. We frequently receive this very attractive offer for 0 % offer cash for a set amount of time. 

We take advantage of the offer, and still want to use the visa card that ends in -XXXX for purchases, knowing that I have to pay ALL purchases off every month form the prior months statement, with some of the Cash offer being carried for the term. 

Often, Bank of America Visa calculates interest on purchases which is not disclosed as part of the 0 % Cash offer. See attached statements and Letter to BOA regarding paying 100 % of our purchases and NOT carrying balances at all for purchases, in fact we pay off some of the cash offer borrowed earlier. 

We only ask for what's fair and in their favor appears to be {$84.00} that needs to be returned. We no longer use the card for purchases and we think that Bank of America should advise that customers who take cash advances not use their card for purchases unless they want to be charged interest. It does appear to be a mistake, as other credit cards that we have 0 % cash offers with with purchases being made & paid off every month have not had this issue. 

The Advertising offer mentions nothing about using the same card for purchases. Please see attached."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2022, I received a text saying that my request for a credit card had been approved from Bank Of America. I did not apply for a card so I called and was told that a card was applied for and that I would receive card within 14 days. I called and got that card cancelled. There was a XXXX dollar balance but whomever applied has all my info."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My issue is with Bank of America. I have been a consumer with them for a very long time. i have an excellent payment history and no delinquencies on my account. However, I had an recent indecent where they were suppose to dispute  XXXX  charges for me.   The bank first informed me that both charges were disputed, and then couple of weeks after I notice the charges are back on my statement, and the statement charges were more then what my credit line was.   I called the bank i was really upset that they would do this to me even though i was working with the other merchant to take care of that balance. I was very upset i did not get the help I needed nor anybody took my frustration into consideration.   I told them I want to close my account and I will not pay that balance because it was suppose to be disputed in the first place.   Now this is going to affect my credit i called the bank again. they keep giving me the runaround and transferring my calls fro m one r epresentative to another.   I needed to address this issue. I feel the bank did not really do what they were suppose to based on the terms and conditions to protect me as a consumer. Thank You."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the unscrupulous behavior, the retaliation, the coercion, the professional lies and deceitful tactics employed by Bank of America in dealing with my previous complaint now closed with Case Number : XXXX. A matter in which they were keen to know if I had retained a lawyer and when I said not at that particular time, their final response was far beyond lackadaisical, lackluster and the outcome was a pure demonstration of how ruthless and unconcerned this particular bank have been towards a customer like myself who has maintained a credit card since XX/XX/XXXX with the bank. This is or was my longest open credit card and without overemphasizing the importance of having a card of such magnitude still open, I have no other choice but to once again ask for your assistance in keeping my card open and investigating this matter further. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX, a Resolution Specialist with the bank 's Regulatory Complaints Team to follow up on the outcome of the ill-fated or unsatisfactory report that was manipulated to their satisfaction after several unprecedented calls where placed asking me for extensions. Overall, it took around sixty days or more to come up with a feedback that should have been reported in fifteen days time. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$280.00} towards the same credit card with account number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which had been reduced to a mere {$900.00} credit limit from its actual limit back in XX/XX/XXXX due to retaliation. Till date, this account is reported with an an astronomical high balance that affects my DTI ( debt to income ration ) and overall credit score. My credit score has taken a huge hit ( now bad to fair according to FICO ) because of Bank of America in-spite of the fact that all other accounts have an excellent payment history. 

The latest lie as of XX/XX/XXXX which is usually my due date was the fact that my account was now tagged as CLOSED. Since my original complaint, my account remained open during the investigation. As a matter of fact, I kept making my {$280.00} payments after being placed on a hardship program on XX/XX/XXXX with some few delayed payments but nothing extra ordinary within or beyond the 30 day mark. Even when I called the bank in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that as long as I was on a hardship program, there was no need to be pressurized to make payments on the XX/XX/XXXX of each month since no late fees were assessed. Therefore, I do not see why Bank of America in the midst of a global pandemic when people like myself are struggling financially to meet their financial responsibilities, the bank without regard for its customers and the US Government 's mandate for financial institutions to grant forbearance during this critical time would take it upon itself to seize the opportunity and close my account as of XX/XX/XXXX. Now the latest lie is that as part of the condition to qualify for the hardship program back in XX/XX/XXXX, I agreed to the account closure which is untrue. I only agreed to the closure of the smaller credit card - Bank of America Cash Rewards Visa Platinum Plus - with Account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of which I still make payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I asked to defer my credit card payment for the BankAmericard Visa Platinum Plus with Account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX rather what I see online is that the card ending in XXXX has no payment due even if this was not what was requested and the latter still has a payment due. The agent I spoke to Ms XXXX stated that the payment was deferred to XX/XX/XXXX and that since my account was closed, it was no longer eligible for a REAGE program in-spite of the fact that Bank of America had clearly stated to me on XX/XX/XXXX and subsequently, that upon further review of my payment history after three to four months, it would Re-age my account and report it as current which would boost my credit score. That was the essence of getting on the hardship program. Even the letter from XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX stated that the Re-age was applicable after six months, again this was a clear indication of the bank 's inconsistency and lies. All through this period, there is proof of deceit, retaliation and evidence tampering, with the way they handled my complaint. They refused to make the recorded conversations or calls available for review, they lied about the date which I qualified for the hardship program which was XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX, they could not wait to submit their flawed findings before subsequently closing my account in the midst of a pandemic against all guidelines. I kindly ask that they my account be re-opened. As of XX/XX/XXXX the agent that I spoke to said all debts and due payment for that particular card would be rolled over to the new 60 month hardship program and so I see no reason why they still claim that my account had a missed payment in XX/XX/XXXX for {$280.00} even though at the time they mentioned that there were two missed payments of {$560.00} which should was untrue. The mandate was to pay {$280.00} on XX/XX/XXXX in order to get on the hardship program which I did."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for an extension of credit on XX/XX/22 and was sent an adverse action letter. I then sent the CEO a response to the letter noting the discriminatory actions on the XXXX of XXXX certified mail, i n which I have received hard copy return receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America has yet too resp ond or grant me the extension of credit as I asked in my initial communication. I have also filed a cf pb complaint as well as a complaint with the attorney general as of today. Bank of America has dire ctly violated my consumer right to credit under 15 USC 1602 ( f ). Bank of America has also committe d fraud by using my credit card without my authority and I received no benefit from that transaction pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( p )."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2020, I made a payment on the above-named account in the amount of {$260.00} to satisfy the minimum payment. The billing cycle for this account is 31 days and it ended on XX/XX/2020 ( see attachment ). On the morning of XX/XX/2020, I paid off the remaining balance on the account in the amount of {$3700.00}. These two payments together totaled {$3900.00} which was the amount I owed on my monthly statement. When speaking with Virginia BOA representative ( Ms. XXXX XXXX she told me that I had paid off the account and my account paid in full. I was notified on XX/XX/2020 that an additional {$32.00} was owed on the account. I was confused as to why I had to pay this amount since I : ( 1 ) satisfied the total amount owed in the pre-cycle balance at XXXX XXXX  on the last day of the billing cycle ; ( 2 ) did not have any transactions fees that would be subject to daily or annual interest calculation ; and ( 3 ) did not have any transactions posted at the beginning of the new billing cycle that was subject to interest accrual. The interest accrued was not in accordance to how BOA stated they calculated interest on my average daily balance, which states : To calculate a daily balance for each day prior to this statement 's billing cycle that had a Pre-Cycle balance : ( 1 ) we take the beginning balance attributable solely to Pre-Cycle balance ( which will be XXXX on the transaction date of the first Pre-Cycle balance ) ; ( 2 ) add an amount equal to the applicable Daily Periodic Rate multiplied by the previous day 's daily balance ; ( 3 ) and add only the applicable Pre-Cycle balances and their related Transaction Fees. We exclude from this calculation all transactions posted in previous billing cycles. 

So, on XX/XX/2020 I paid the {$32.00} and BOA issued me a new statement of {$0.00}. BOA incorrectly charged me equal to one percent ( 1 % ) of my APR when I paid off the entire balance by the end of the billing cycle. I am asking for a refund of the {$32.00} that was incorrectly calculated and billed to my account."

Credit card or prepaid card,"My credit limit was lowered from {$11000.00} to {$6200.00} and when I questioned this vie letter on XX/XX/2018, a hard inquiry was placed on my credit report. This is not the same as requesting for credit since it is because of an action you took. I have been a good customer and never missed a payment on any Bank of America account. I even made a large payment of {$2500.00} on XX/XX/2018 that I now wish I didn't made if I knew my credit limit would be lowered. Even though my credit report shows negative accounts, these balances involve transactions I disputed. With the balance at approximately {$6000.00}, its obvious my limit was lowered to just above that amount. Now it looks like my card is maxed out instead of 55 % used. I shouldnt be penalized for my history with other creditors."

The bank had attempted on numerous occasions to withdraw the money from my checking act before the due date resulting in overdraft fees, insufficient fund fees accumulation. I have an auto deposit into my checking act that occur on the XXXX of each month that should cover the payment, however the bank had intentionally processed the payment on the XXXX or XXXX of the previous month. After 4 years of making payments on this credit card totaling more than {$4800.00} at an interest of 9 %, I contacted the bank on numerous occasions trying to understand how did this happen?

Credit card or prepaid card,"This is a continuing complaint about how Bank of America is trying to avoid responsibility and mistreat fraud victims. 
( The previous complaint ID is XXXX and the complaint is as follows. 
This is about Bank of America EDD benefit debit card. Like so many other victims, my unemployment benefit money was stolen from my Bank of America Debit Card. Someone either hacked into my account or more likely because of Bank of America system issues or internal staff issue, someone had accessed my account and transferred XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to an unknown account. ( To this day, I don't know the account information, since it is blocked when I logged into my account ). I filed claim with B of A, got the credit. However, after about a month or so, B of A sent me a letter, saying the bank did not do anything wrong so the credit was reversed without any investigation. I called and requested to reopen the claim and after about a month or so, got another letter saying the money was transferred by either an authorized user or someone I gave my online information. I asked them to send me the proof and let me know who the authorized user is to no avail. Of course, they do not have any proof because they are simply playing the game without any investigation. They need to do something to catch the real criminal who commit the fraud instead of blaming the victim. ) Bank of Americas investigator contacted me, repeated the some nonsense and denied wrongdoing, After I demanded proof of their investigation, he told me that since I believed this was a fraud, I should file a fraud claim not dispute the charge ( which is ridiculous since every customer service rep that I spoke to was told it was a fraud and I was advised to file police report and send it to them ) So if this was an error, it was not my error, but Bank of Americas most likely intentional error. Having said that the representative transferred me to the so- called Fraud department and I repeated my stories again for the who knows how many times and filed a new claim. This happened on XX/XX/2021. 

( Here is what the investigators response from the previous complaint. 
"" During our telephone conversation on XX/XX/2021, you expressed concern that the transaction listed above is not a billing dispute but a fraudulent transaction. I transfer you to our Fraud Department to open a new Fraud claim. For further questions, please contact our Fraud Department at XXXX, Monday through Friday, XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Eastern '' ) On XX/XX/2021, I called XXXX, trying to check the status of my new claim and was only to be told that the new claim was denied because it was a duplicate claim. What a joke! 
It was the investigator who told me that the initial claim was filed incorrectly and a new fraud claim should be filed, here again it was denied because it was duplicate. I dont know how can a bank operate business like this. 

I will continue to fight until this is resolved. Bank of America has the obligation to investigate the fraud criminal. I am a Bank of America client for over a decade, having checking saving, retirement, investment accounts. Bank of America owes me the money, my wasted time and more important an answer to a loyal client."
Credit card or prepaid card,Bank of america closed my XXXX debit card and I still have money on it.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America did not process my dispute properly. I sent them numerous documents in support of my claim, and they dismissed it on the basis that I had not provided "" a receipt '' for the transaction. I told them there was no receipt issued. It was a salon that does not issue paper receipts. They only run the charge through a machine. My hair was damaged by a salon service and I asked for my money to be refunded. I provided an expert statement about the condition of my hair. I provided a statement from a coworker who gave an opinion of how damaged my hair is, and I sent photos of how the merchant stained my hair XXXX through their negligent application of the salon products. They never considered my supporting documents."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Received notice by email on XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America indicating they had made the decision to close [ my ] account.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have had an account with Bank of America since 2009 ( credit card and checking ). It is my oldest account, and I was a happy and loyal BofA customer, trusting it since 2009 when trust in the bank was at an all time low post the financial crisis. 

Like my other cards, I have paid ALL my bills in life on time, have never missed a payment ( on anything ) and have a pristine credit report/score. 

However, 5 days ago, with no notice or warning, BofA shuts down my oldest credit card account. No warning was given, and after spending an hour with their account closure department, they were unable to provide a reason why this was done, and unable to reinstate it. We are in the middle of a global pandemic. Banks ( like BofA, who have stuffed themselves silly with all sorts of bailout money while engaging in share buybacks - looking at you XXXX XXXX ) are screwing customers for no reason. These deceitful business practices should NOT be allowed to continue"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My Bank of America credit card BankAmericard Visa Platinum Plus - XXXX was stolen. Somebody went on a shopping spree in XXXX. Once I discovered the fraud, I immediately started calling Bank of America every day, sometimes 2-3 times a day. naturally, every time I called, I got different answers to the same question. Finally, after a giant amount of wasted time, Bank of America filed fraud for some of the transactions and willfully failed to exclude some additional transactions, all happening in XXXX while I was in the US. Walking to a banking center proved useless, as employees said they could not help with a credit card dispute. Bank of America is so "" big to fail and even bigger to jail '', that their "" customer service '' does not know how to handle fraud claims and the different departments handling fraud, have no idea of customer service. My same card was previously compromised several times, even during transit, when I had not yet received their replacement. In a nutshell, dealing with Bank of America is extremely time consuming and beyond frustrating. Additionally, average wait times vary between 15 & 45 minutes, of course with the usual slim excuse : "" Your business is important to us, please continue to hold ... '' On top of that, I spent easily 50 hours online, trying unsuccessfully to file fraud claims myself for all the charges, resulting from my stolen card, and naturally, I was not able to. I have told them at least 20 times that all transactions from XX/XX/2018 onward should be marked as fraud, and so far, I have not been successful.

I have multiple issues with this policy change. They have instituted this policy to generate late fee income and unnecessary interest charges. Many customers will not see this letter of Automatic Payment Cancelation and their credit score will be affected when their payment is not be paid. Canceling Automatic Payment will only benefit Bank of America fee income and will hurt the consumer. This action by Bank of America should result in a class action lawsuit that I would gladly participate in."

Credit card or prepaid card,Bank of America records payment calls in East Coast time. They collect late fees from customers making payments by the time stamp in East Coast time regardless of the time the payment was actually made  based on the location of the customer. There is no notice that phone payments are only considered on time based on East Coast time. I was charged a late fee based on a payment logged as late in East Coast time but that was submitted on time - on XX/XX/2020 - on the West Coast. This is discriminatory and fraudulent.
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/XXXX  credit card declined. The last three times I have used card it was declined but when call company was told there was no problem. When I called today, XX/XX/XXXX , the said they had closed account. The card was in my deceased husband 's name. However, within a week after his death, I took death certificate to bank and they changed name of checking account, savings account, overdraft protection, and another credit card. The account that has been closed showed I presented death certificate but a bank employee failed to complete the necessary process. I have used this card with my name on it for almost 4 years ( his death was  XX/XX/XXXX ). This card had a {$21000.00} limit and {$530.00} in cash rewards. Payments are current and balance is {$1200.00}. They will not even give me the cash rewards as will only issue check in deceased husband 's name. It finally registered why they are doing this when was told they were scrubbing accounts ( after 4 years ). When he mentioned it was not discrimination, then I realized they do not want a   XXXX   year old retired person with that high of a credit limit. My charges made have always been low and payments made. This is obviously age discrimination. At the least, I want my {$530.00} cash rewards."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a bank of america credit card. In XX/XX/XXXX the minimum payment changed. I was enrolled in an automatic bill pay. The automatic payment amount was not changed to reflect the higher minimum. The payment was credited as late, and a late charge applied. This happened until XXXX of XXXX. At such time i became aware of this. ( no attempt to contact me about his problem was made ). In XXXX i believed this was taken care of. I spoke to them, they adjusted my account and the guy told me my payment was straitened out. 

today,XX/XX/2018 i find out that in fact the exact same thing has been happening since XXXX of last year. The guy i spoke to in fact did not fix my payment methods and although the minimum at the time was lower so that the amount my account was set to pay was sufficient for XXXX, it then back higher and again i began accruing late fees. I contacted them and they refunded some ( but not all ) of the fee, but they then told me i had make changes to my account via web page in order to get the account to where it would make a minimum payment every month, regardless of amount. 

The process is unnecessarily onerous and complicated. As someone with experience designing and creating websites and bill payment systems theirs is overly convoluted. After 18 months and 2 lengthy attempts at contacting them, my account is still not set up to make a recurring minimum payment every month. However only after my second interaction am I left with the knowledge this is not the case. 

As a credit card consumer, their process is so vastly different and outside the normal experience ( regarding setting up a payment for the minimum amount every month, i can only conclude that this is deliberately difficult in order to confuse consumers about the state of their account. 

These practices are at best indicative of inapt user experience planning, but more like a result of deliberate and intentionally deceptive design."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a credit card via the XXXX XXXX website on or before XX/XX/. Now, I was not able to charge my flight to the card to benefit from applying. I was told that I had to wait to get the card in the mail. At the time of applying I was not being charged an Annual Fee of {$79.00}. Why should I pay XXXX to pay XXXX XXXX {$30.00} XXXX in Compensation. 

I have never used this card. This card is attempting to collect a debt, I do not owe, nor did I agree to this charge. The card is currently, past due this annual fee. They say, I have been late since XXXX. I do not want to have this reported negatively on my credit report nor do I want to use. 

Could you tell me if I close the account will it negatively affect my credit report score. I have excellent credit."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for and secured ( followed a hard credit inquiry ) a Business Advantage Customized Cash Rewards card from Bank of America, as part of opening a business checking account with their bank. 

Before applying and opening the accounts, I asked multiple representatives whether or not specific vendors would be eligible under their rewards categories, and they confirmed that vendors ( specifically, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). 

After spending XXXX days tracking down the XXXX codes to determine which category to select ( after opening the account ), I learned that these services are not eligible. 

Unfortunately, beyond Bank of America 's misleading sales practices, applying for an opening the account involved a hard inquiry into my credit, negatively affecting my score. This had a direct impact on my immediate ability to secure more favorable lending terms, which I was happy to experience if the bank had been honest about its product, but it wasn't. 

I have asked Bank of America to honor its agreement and add the codes to one of its rewards categories, but it has, to date, refused. It has also, to date, refused to do anything to provide an alternative method to ameliorate the situation."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Hi, This is XXXX XXXX. I have Bank of America ( BoA ) accounts. This year in XXXX, my account ( checking and saving ) was accessed without my authorization and used to make {$2400.00} XXXX transfer to people I do not know. I did not lose my card so my accounts were actually remotely hacked. Then two months later in late XXXX, my BoA credit card was used to pay for two digital orders as gifts to people I do not know on XXXX. This time the total loss is about {$650.00}. Again I did not lose my card so it was my account that was hacked. I reported these two cases immediately to BoA after I noticed the fraud but BoA rejected both of my claims, based on the reason that "" nothing is wrong with my account or we do not find a problem with the device used for the transaction ''.

I did check my computer and found that there were unauthorized remote access account. That means my computer was hacked. That is probably why everything looks fine at the end of BoA ( the hacker still used my computer to make those fraudulent transactions so BoA probably thinks it was me ). I think what may have happened is like this : I have the function called "" save my password for this website '' enabled on my computer. I thought it is safe because this is my own computer. But somehow hackers gained remote access to my computer and automatically logged in to my online banking account since the passwords are saved in the browser. Then they made those fraudulent transactions. However, after I reported this situation to BoA, they requested me to submit an official certification that my computer is hacked. This is frankly impossible for me because 1 ) I deleted all unauthorized accounts immediately after I found them. So if you check my computer again now, it is safely guarded ; 2 ) It seems that BoA wants me to invite professional computer security personnel to thoroughly check my computer, but this would be too inconvenient and too expensive for me. 

All in all, when my accounts were hacked to make fradulent transactions, BoA rejected my fraud claims based on reasons that "" my account looks normal ''. Compared to other cases such as losing the card, I have my devices by my hand but the device is remotely accessed without my permission. So on the surface my device and account would look normal but it is actually not. BoA clearly did not take this situation into consideration and put an unreasonable burden on customers to prove the existence of hacking activity. I even think that BoA deliberately develops such daunting procedures so that no customer would really pursue their claims under such situation. I am really disappointed with BoA and I will quit using it as a banking service, regardless of whether I can get my money back. I hope your esteemed agency can put some pressure on BoA so that they could at least reinvestigate my cases. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have one ( 1 ) Bank of America credit card ending in XXXX and one ( 1 ) Bank of America debit card ending in XXXX. 

I do not know when monthly payment is due BECAUSE THE BANK OF AMERICA NO LONGER PROVIDES ME WITH PAPER BILLS! 

I have repeatedly complained to Mr. XXXX of the XXXX, New Jersey branch of the Bank of America. He promised to make sure I have paper bills. That was three ( 3 ) weeks ago. 

I still receive NO paper bills and so am at a loss what I owe on the two said cards! 

I NEVER AGREED TO PAPERLESS BILLING!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was a with BANK OF AMERICA customer since XXXX and during that time, I have enjoyed my experience greatly. I am writing to see if you would be willing to make a "" goodwill '' adjustment to your reporting to the three credit agencies. I have late payments on the above referenced account ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). Since that time I was an exceptional customer paying every month on time. Because of my exceptional payment history over the last years, I would like you to consider removing the negative payments from my credit report. At the time of the late payments, I was in the process of changing jobs. I say that not to justify why the payments were late, but rather to show that the late payments are not a good indicator of my actual credit worthiness."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX of XXXX  I receive a LETTER from Bank Of America stating I hav n't paid my invoice that was enrolled in "" Paperless '' billing. I NEVER enroll in paperless billing. We have gone thru this back and forth with the XXXX XXXX XXXX already. They suggested we contact you. After receiving the letter we IMMEDIATELY called. paid the balance in full over the phone. the amount was approx XXXX dollars that had accumulated over 2 or 3 months. It was a new card we had just gotten the end of the previous year. we barely used this one. We pay off credit cards on a monthly basis totalling close to XXXX every single month used for our business and personal finances. XXXX dollars is a drop in the bucket to us. We certainly would not have left this go. We NEVER sign up for paperless billing. First We're older, we do things old school. We ALWAYS have a paper invoice sent to us so we can go over our statement to be sure there are no fraudulant charges. In Todays world it seems once a year we find a fraudulant charge. Second, we rarely check our E-mail. It's not something we commonly do. My husband takes care of the bills and still uses a flip phone. We rarely text because of this. We keep the paper invoices for a paper trail of our business expenses for our business. We explained this to Bank Of America Representative. They made us pay off and close the account which we found odd over the phone when we called in when we received the Letter in XXXX of XXXX. I asked that the late fee be removed which they agreed to. I asked if this was going to be on our credit report, they informed us that yes it was. We asked that to be removed as well and they refused. Again, we are old school and take pride that we have NEVER EVER had a blemish to our credit report. Because of this blemish another credit card reduced our total credit line which then adversely affected our business payments to our vendors we owe on a monthly basis that we had setup as AUTOPAY WITH PAPER STATEMENTS as well. We NEVER received a phone call or a paper invoice sent to us before this delinquent notice. They said it was our responsibility to check our e-mail and then pay the invoice. This is EXACTLY why we never sign up for this sort of thing. So I paid this off over the phone and asked them to review their mistake. In XXXX I receive a letter dated XX/XX/2022 stating after the review they feel it was not their fault. claiming that we indeed enrolled in paperless. At this point I asked for a paper copy of the invoices for the previous months that were not paid so I could see what these purchases were even for. there again, I was not enrolled in checking it online or thru email. I'm not even sure how to go about this. They did send us paper copies at this point. ( why didn't they before? ) AND I asked them to review their mistake once again. On XX/XX/2022 I received the paper copies of the invoices I had asked for to show us proof for our records. at this point I didn't even have paper copies for our records. then XX/XX/2022 I received another letter stating they still refuse to remove it from our credit report and they do NOT take responsiblity for the mistake. At this point we contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX In the meantime, We enrolled for another credit card. It made us get online. we were going to enroll in AUTOPAY like we have other cards in the past. WITH PAPER billing to go along with it. We both watched VERY carefully to make sure we were NOT making any mistakes. The "" PAPERLESS '' box was automatically checked off. we did NOT check this off. So we UNCHECKED the box and clicked on SAVE. before signing out, we double checked it. It did NOT keep our Saved info, and indeed enrolled us in PAPERLESS. I went in and did the same thing again a 2nd time. That time it saved it.... Then just 2 weeks ago we enrolled in yet another credit card and the SAME exact thing happened. The "" PAPERLESS '' box was pre checked off. we unchecked it and hit save. when we double checked it, it had checked off the box again and made it PAPERLESS by itself. We had to go back in a 2nd time and uncheck it. and THEN on the 2nd attempt it SAVED IT. I'm sure this is what happened with the Bank Of America Card as well. It seems to me, Cards are purposely doing this to generate late fee 's. If a Million customers have this happen, they conveniently created XXXX XXXX dollars in late fee 's. based on a XXXX dollar late fee. This is obviously being done on purpose and I think is CRIMINAL. This NEEDS investigated. I want this blemish removed from our credit report all 3 of the credit bureaus. AND these companies need investigated for doing this. This is absolutely a type of FRAUD going on. Bank of America did get back to the XXXX XXXX XXXX but still kept saying it was not their fault. It indeed is. They are purposely doing this to customers all across the country. In fact I have mentioned this to friends and discovered this EXACT same thing has happened to 2 other friends. If this is NOT where I need to report this, PLEASE let me know where I need to go from here. The XXXX XXXX XXXX tells me they just have to accept their answer and can not MAKE the company correct any problem."

On my behalf, I apologized profusely for the unwarranted calls which she claimed I made. However, I sent an email and text requesting a reply to the additional charges. Upon speaking to XXXX XXXX, she raised her voice and again I apologized. I did not receive an apology or any accountability for the error which caused me to overdraft three times a total of {$120.00} instead, I was unmoved by her actions to refund my monies from at this point seems to be {$2200.00} ( XXXX ) I am looking to work remotely in the interim while my VA commission process. Although, I expressed that Here I am not working but paid for training to become XXXX. Needless to say, {$750.00} is a lot to not know what you are not getting.

I contacted Bank of America immediately and spoke to the Fraud Department. They went ahead and placed a temporary credit on my account for the amount of {$7800.00} and they closed out the credit card ending in XXXX and issued me a new credit card of which I have received. I also immediately placed a fraud alert via the credit bureaus and went to Identitytheft.gov to file a report there as well. 
I had explained to Bank of America that I did not make that charge and that I had just finished paying off my entire previous balance so that my account is in XXXX since I had just moved out of state and trying to purchase a new home. 
I received an email and a letter from Bank of America on XX/XX/2021 stating that they denied my fraud claim and that I would be responsible for the entire amount because they concluded that based on my previous purchase history, I had made purchases with the same merchant in the past. I contacted Bank of America on XX/XX/2021 to dispute the denial and I told them that I had never made any purchases with that merchant booking.com so that was untrue and I asked them to provide a copy of my credit purchase history of which they did not do. They then told me to go to local police department to file a police report, which I immediately took care of after ending the call with Bank of America on XX/XX/2021. I contacted XXXX, Idaho Policy Dept. and spoke to Officer XXXX and she took my police report and issued me police report # XXXX. I contacted Bank of America back the same day and gave them the police report #. The representative who took the report # said they would reopen the claim and further investigate.

So they have not further investigated nor done anything else to help me with this disputing this fraud claim. 
Please be advised that I also had multiple fraudulent charges on a separate credit card XXXX XXXX totaling {$25.00} that they were able to remove without any further questions. 
I need your help to further dispute this fraudulent charge for the amount of {$7800.00} and credited back to my card and also to dispute that Bank of America Fraud Department is doing a poor job in helping identity theft victims like myself and not doing a good enough job investigating.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank Of America Bank of America Platinum credit card tied to my bank account on Smart Phone.     I pay my payment every month,  XXXX  month in advance, always paid on the  XXXX  of the month. But every month I was apparently receiving a late fee that was not listed on my online ( phone  )  bank statement not on the year end summary of the account.     the bank is saying the payment was due by the  XXXX  of the month, and even though I paid every month a month in advance on the  XXXX  of the month it was considered late. Only months that I made additional payments did I not receive a late fee. No where online or in statements does the account indicate that there is a windows each month that you can not make payments,  XXXX  to the  XXXX  of the month, the most frequent time people make monthly payments.     In addition the online account never shows the fee being charged for account. The fee apparently is posted on the last day of the account statement, and is not visible any other time. The online as the statement only shows the current statement period and after the next day the fee is no longer visible. The link to previous statements is deliberately hidden.  The Highlight and Underline on the text for statements has been removed so there is not way t t ell that is a link to previous statements.     Even the Year end statement deliberately does not include fees charged on the account. If you are a modern person, especially a Millennials, who maintains tracking accounts on your smart phone and use the account to ensure you pay monthly you will never know you are being charged late fees for the card. Only way you can tell what fees you are being charged is to download the monthly statement which is only way to access statements when using paperless option.     It 's was gong on for over a year., I have unknowingly paid over {$250.00} dollars in late fees. In addition and the fees change from  XXXX  dollars to  XXXX  dollars randomly.     This is truly engineered predatory banking for online paperless banking."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for unemployment XXXX XXXX started working and never received any information regarding unemployment benefits so I just disregarded it. My mail box was broken into. This was reported to the post office. I never received a Bank of America Bank card for my unemployment benefits. Someone completely took control of the account. They somehow got the Bank card and all of my information. They assigned an email I am not familiar with and even changed the address through unemployment. Meanwhile, {$8000.00} was paid out to the theft. Once I found out this information I filed a fraud claim with unemployment which hasnt been resolved yet. I filed a fraud claim with Bank of America which I included a statement and documents of proof as well as police report and they denied my claim three times. Bank of America said that the transactions that were made were not suspicious. How the heck is getting a XXXX XXXX  every single pay day from unemployment not suspicious. If you look at how I use my card now that I actually have it, there is a huge difference! I post my bills and grocery shop and etc. I just want the money owed to me"
Credit card or prepaid card,I have been victimized by identity theft. The fraudulent Activity happened on XX/XX/2019 with a balance of {$25000.00} which I did not make. I have filed this to the police and they advised me to submit a dispute.

And this shows on my credit report."
Credit card or prepaid card,I paid off my balance. Then I accidentally transferred an extra {$5200.00} instead of sending it to my savings. That was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested they return the money to my checking account. Bank of America visa said it would be 5-10 business days. XX/XX/XXXX was ten business days. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and then said I would have the money by close of business day. I still do not have my money. Thats a very scary amount of time to not have my money yet returned to me.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an electronic payment to Bank of America in the amount of {$8300.00} ( this amount paid my account in full ).

When this amount was still not credited as of XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America again and spoke to someone named XXXX XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America took advantage of me at a time 'where every company in America was helping everyone else out. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX who was effected tremendously by the Covid-19 Pandemic. as the owner of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX i was out of work from XX/XX/2020 until about XXXX of this year. i notified all of my credit cards/mortgage company of this and each and every one of them including bank of America put me on the Covid relief program where i didn't have to make payments if i was unable to but this wouldn't effect my credit until i was able to get back on my feet. 
With each program they ended after 90 days, so back in XXXX I was notified I needed to update my status and let BOA know if i was back to work. I wasn't at this time so after this call i was put back into another relief program or extended as they call it. so fast forward to Late XXXX this past year. i was forced to sell my house due to the pandemic and work not coming in and not being able to gather all funds from previous months skipped due to the pandemic. i notified all my creditors that i was selling my home and i was going to be using the profits to pay my debts. everything was great until I contacted Bank Of America. To my surprise i was informed that my credit cards were closed. I was told that there was a form I needed to sign in order for the extension to take place. I didnt receive any notification stating any of this or that my account was past due. All along I thought I was protected. This scenario effected me in ways i never imagined. When i sold my house i learned my credit score for the first time in my life was in the low 570 's because of Bank Of America. I was unable to establish living due to this and was forced to move in with family until I could fix my credit issue. 
This scenario hurt in many ways especially with my credit but also because i worked for Bank Of America for 14 years. One of the Two credit cards which was closed first but wasn't actually later on payment than the other was an associate credit card which was grandfathered and had a low rate which was fixed and will never be available again. Never in my life was i late with payments i always established a Overall Respectable credit score I worked so hard to establish. At a time where these big banks should be helping those who were effected by the pandemic such as myself they did the complete opposite. They took advantage of me at a time where I was hurt most. I did my part i made calls and even after the fact have gotten in contact with BOA and I am unable to get any assistance they just put the blame on me. I don't understand how to start this program I never once had to sign a form but to extend it I did. I never received the form. I also would never not sign something that would benefit me there was no downside to this. Its not right what Bank Of America did to me and even worse they don't care to listen. They could see my credit history and payment history I had these cards for over 13 years. they are to big to care about the little guys and its not right because this has really effected me in more ways than one."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received an alert email from XXXX on XX/XX/2023 saying they blocked an attempt to access my XXXX credit file because my file is locked ; and on XX/XX/2023, I received another alert email from XXXX saying I have 1 new credit alert to review. So that got my attention, I logged into my XXXX app to check and found out that on XX/XX/2023, someone opened a Bank of America credit card using my name, my SSN, but a WRONG address! I contacted Bank of America immediately to report this fraudulent activity and the representative who answered my call said she submitted a fraud application report for me. The address on file of this Bank of America is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX, their phone number is XXXX, that is the number shown in XXXX. Then, I filed an online dispute in my XXXX app regarding this fraudulent application. 

On XX/XX/2023, XXXX notified me via email that my dispute has been updated, and I logged in to see the dispute result, heres the result : The company ( Bank of America ) that reported the information has certified to XXXX that the information is accurate. 
This result is simply ridiculously false! Bank of America is lying, I did NOT apply for any Bank of America credit card or any credit card in XX/XX/2023. It is very frustrating that Bank of America allowed such fraudulent activity to happen and lied to the credit bureau! This is very abusive!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have previously submitted the complaint below, but Bank of America has yet to resolve anything or even attempt to assist. They had a representative named XXXX XXXX e-mail me on XX/XX/XXXX to state she would be my point of contact and she requested I reach out to her to confirm my contact information. I then e-mailed her on 3 separate occasions to no response, and I called her XXXX separate times and left voicemails that were also never returned. Since then, Bank of America has now said I am responsible for the charges on XXXX of the XXXX cards in question and is still reviewing the second card which they will likely hold me responsible for as well since it was the same event. These are charges I can not afford to be held accountable for and is destroying my life financially after being defrauded by a group of bad actors. They rationale they gave for holding me responsible on the XXXX of XXXX card was that they "" concluded I was the one who used the card '' which I had already told them as I was defrauded over the phone. 

Again, this is the summary of my experience in being defrauded : Complaint against Bank of America On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by an official XXXX number informing me that I was the main subject of a money laundering operation and that my profession as an anti-money laundering analyst strengthened their suspicion. I would later come to find that these individuals were not whom they said they were a defrauded me for over {$25000.00}. While on the call a number from XXXX Texas Police Department came through which the fake XXXX rep told me to answer as they were 'working with local law enforcement '. The local police number confirmed what the XXXX rep had told me and when I was skeptical of their claims they then e-mailed me an arrest warrant with instructions of how to handle the situation while under investigation. This included putting my funds into pay vouchers to avoid my funds being frozen which would be returned to me at the end of the investigation period if I was found to be innocent. The next 2 days consisted of them surveilling me and forcing me to convert my funds into pay vouchers via XXXX as well as the majority of my credit limit on my cards so a potential perpetrator would not be able to do so themselves. XXXX, they said, is one of the companies whom law enforcement has an arrangement with for these circumstances and would allow for me to be refunded. As I continued to grow frustrated with the process I contacted XXXX Police Department on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX directly and asked for XXXX XXXX whom the fraudster claimed to be, and I was told there was no XXXX XXXX and that I would need to contact XXXX Police Department to inform. I spoke with police on XX/XX/XXXX and they walked me through what I needed to do to try and mitigate the situation the best I could and also contacted Target to alert. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report, contacted the financial institutions which were impacted to report fraud, canceled cards, changed user names & passwords etc. My complaint is specifically for Bank of America whom I initially contacted on XX/XX/XXXX to report fraud. They made me inform 3 different departments of fraud for my checking account, Debit Card and Credit Cards. I was told that the process would take a week and they would reach out to discuss next steps. A week passed and I heard nothing back. I checked the other financial institutions I contacted to report fraud and they had all refunded charges and issued me new credit cards, except for Bank of America. I then contacted Bank of America again on XX/XX/XXXX for a status update and checking/debit departments said that there was no update, but they would expedite to a XXXX hour update window ( which I still haven't heard back from as of XX/XX/XXXX ), and then transferred me to the credit card department to see if there was a status update there. The credit card department then said I never filed a fraud case ( blatantly incorrect ) but yet also said they determined it wasn't fraud somehow. They then backtracked to say they did see that I called in to notify, but even though I was deceived and defrauded ( which by legal definition is fraud ), I would not receive any credit back. I then asked how have they left my XXXX credit card accounts I filed fraud on and requested new cards wide open for XXXX weeks and they said it was a mistake and they would do that immediately which they have still not done. Lastly, after I had been defrauded for every XXXX I have and an additional {$13000.00} in credit charges Bank of America refuses to forgive, I had to sell my only vehicle just so I could eat and pay bills. Upon deposit of the check from selling my vehicle, Bank of America only cleared 40 % of the check inexplicably leaving 60 % of the check on hold. The check was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX and is still not cleared. This also needs to be resolved."
Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/2023 an application for Bank of America Travel Rewards credit card was processed without authorization and Bank of America processed a hard inquiry pull using my information. This is not the first time Bank of America has allowed accounts to be fraudulently opened as someone used my information for a mortgage when I was only XXXX XXXX XXXX.
Credit card or prepaid card,"This is a follow up to complaint # XXXX that I filed earlier today. 

I reported 2 credit card transactions from XXXX XX/XX/2021 as fraudulent ( {$3000.00} & {$2000.00} ). But because of the nature of the transactions ( unauthorised 'ACH payment refunds ' ), Bank of America 's Existing Fraud Department informed me that they need to file a 'manual "" report which could take days or weeks, then they'll investigate, which could take weeks or months, and I might not even get my money back. 

In the mean time, because the 2 fraudulent refunds equalled the amount of the legitimate {$5000.00} credit card payment I made 6 XX/XX/2021, Bank of America says that I still owe a minimum payment ( {$150.00} ) this month in order to keep my account from accruing late fees. Except I already paid my bill this month, and I have my XXXX bank statement to prove it. They're the ones who allowed XXXX giant fraudulent transactions to occur. They neglected to notify me of suspicious activity, even though I've never before authorised similar transactions on my account. And they are now attempting to extort me into paying an extra {$150.00} this month to rectify a problem that they created. 

This is my primary business & travel card. I don't have the luxury of waiting around for months for a refund, and it's illogical that I should be held accountable for additional late fees or expenses that accrue while the fraud department investigates. 

I spent over 4 hours on the phone today being transferred continually between Customer Service & the Fraud department. Fraud says they can't investigate until the claim is processed & Customer Service says they can't do anything about the required minimum payment unless Fraud authorises it, except Fraud says they don't have control over payment authorisations. 

Bank of America needs to take responsibility for their incompetence & refund my money, and the person responsible for authorising the 'ACH payment refunds ' needs to fired."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2018 I called Bank of America to pay off and close my credit card account. I payed over the phone using a checking account from another bank. I paid Bank of America my total balance of {$5000.00}. I asked to have the account closed, and asked the person I was speaking with 3 times if this would then conclude my business with Bank of America. The person I was speaking with advised me that even though the account was closed if I had any recurring charges ( ie XXXX account ect. ) there was "" a chance '' ( her words ) that those charges would post to the account and I would be responsible for them. Because I don't have any recurring billing accounts linked to this credit card account, I said "" ok '' and assumed that was that. 

Yesterday XX/XX/2018 I received a bill from Bank of America for {$27.00}. I called Bank of America using the phone number at the bottom of the bill ( which turned out to be customer service for checking accounts ) and eventually spoke to a person that told me that the {$27.00} was interest accrued after I closed the account. Because there where days remaining on the XX/XX/2018 billing cycle after the day I paid off my account and closed it, I was still charged interest on the closed account. 

I believe that Bank of America is purposefully murky and misleading as to their practices involving personal credit cards ( as further illustrated by listing the wrong departments customer service phone number on a credit card bill ). I believe that I should not be held responsible for the interest accrued after I closed my account, and that the bank is smart enough to prorate the remains days of interest when a customer attempts to close their account on a day that does not coincide with the start or end of a billing cycle. Even though it's only {$27.00}, I am outraged that the bank has seen fit to charge me XXXX cent after paying off my account completely."
Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with Bank of America 's representative XXXX XXXX about financial hardship my family has been experiencing. I explained that I lost my job and my husband lost half of his income since Covid-19 started and I needed help not to get behind. She told me the only thing they can do is to put me on the plan that will lower my monthly payment by a slight amount and I will still be responsible for all late payments and fees without any lowering my super high interest rate. I explained to her that it will only make the situation worse and incrrase the debt when I wont be able to make a minimum payment. Ms. XXXX repeated that she cant do anything else and when I asked her to speak with her manager she said she is the only one I could speak with.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my boyfriend and I purchased a cruise through a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX, billed as XXXX XXXX on our credit card. We realized post-purchase that the company was fraudulent after doing a XXXX search on XXXX XXXX - tried to call the company to request a refund - they disconnected their phone, and then filed a dispute with our bank ( Bank of America ) to resolve the situation and get our money back from this fake company. BofA requested information from us about the situation, which I provided, credited us back the amount the fake merchant took from us in XXXX, and then took the credit back, recharging us for this fake purchase. This took months, and I received the charge back on my card on XX/XX/XXXX. Calling the bank again to see what happened and why I was re-charged for this clearly fraudulent charge, they provided "" evidence '' from the merchant that we were unable to get ahold of that was entirely fabricated. The merchant stated that they had sent us an email confirmation and we responded with a signed document and photo ID confirming acceptance of the charge and trip. This is 100 % false. The name that they signed on the document is not even my boyfriend 's name. They got the initial of his last name wrong. Also, there is no ID provided, because none of that ever happened. Another dispute was filed for a supposedly deeper investigation on XX/XX/XXXX. So, after two so-called investigations into the matter, Bank of America sided with a fake company that provided clearly false information to them. My boyfriend has an account with BofA, they know that isn't his last initial. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a second denial on our dispute claim and am still expected to pay {$800.00} to my bank and a fake company. This is not fair and we have provided information showing that it is fake. The result that comes up in a XXXX search about XXXX XXXX is that it is a scam vacation company based out of XXXX. I looked at that page today, found a phone number for the company - as the one we had tried continuously before was disconnected, it went straight through and the man I spoke with was the same man we spoke with back in XXXX when we were conned. I demanded a refund and discussed the situation with him and how false evidence was provided by them to our bank. He requested I send a copy of the statement from our bank saying our claim was denied and then their verification department would look at it. The issue at hand is that a fake company stole our money, two disputes were made with our bank, and the bank sided with the fake company that provided them with blatantly false statements. We want justice and our money back while being wildly disappointed in Bank of America for their lack of due diligence."
Credit card or prepaid card,"OVERVIEW : Since XXXX I have been a preferred customer of Bank of America ( BofA ), with two savings accounts, a checking account, and a VISA credit card. The VISA card is paid automatically from one of the savings accounts ; there has never been a late payment, interest charges, or penalties of any kind. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was alerted by email that my Bank of America checking account had been hacked, beginning at the end of XXXX. I visited the Banks XXXX branch and the bank representative changed the passcode. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my ATM and realized that unauthorized withdrawals had been made from a savings account. No alert was given by the bank. Again, I visited the bank and was told that my accounts would be frozen. 
On a XX/XX/XXXX visit to the XXXX branch I observed on the bank managers computer that my accounts had not been frozen and looting had continued ; in excess of {$40000.00} had been stolen. 
Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX BofA never reached out to me, via phone, email, or letter, regarding the unusual activity or to resolve the issues due to the activity. All contact was initiated by me, either by telephone or in-person at the XXXX, MA branch XXXX. 
No one took ownership of the situation to resolve it. Phone calls, with repeated transfers, were always with different individuals who had no knowledge of the issues. Even bank managers at the branch location had no authority to make decisions and relied exclusively on the same telephone contacts. 
Additionally, the restitution of funds was random and did not correlate to the amounts of the unauthorized withdrawals. BofA has not provided a specific statement of the stolen amounts and date of reimbursement, despite my repeated requests ; at this point I am not sure that all missing funds have been replaced. 

XXXX CARD : On my XX/XX/XXXX visit to the XXXX, MA branch, the bank manager told me that my BofA VISA card account was perfectly safe, even though my other accounts had been compromised. I last used the card on XX/XX/XXXX when I realized unauthorized charges were being made. 
Payments for the VISA account had always been made as automatic deductions from a savings account. However, due to the issues with my accounts being hacked, branch personnel suggested I either pay by check or in person by withdrawal from a still existing account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$2900.00} on to satisfy the XXXX bill, and then on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$2300.00} for the XXXX bill. For both of these transactions, bank personnel stood with me at the teller and I received written receipts. Additionally I received an email acknowledgement that the XX/XX/XXXX payment had been received. In XXXX I received a bill without itemization, which I assumed was the bill for XXXX, and sent a check for {$320.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ; this check was from my new bank, not a BofA check. Thereafter I received subsequent bills that credited none of these payments. Telephone calls and visits to the branch resolved nothing. I called or visited the bank at least XXXX times and no explanation was given. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX no bank personnel contacted me to help or explain no letter, no email, no phone call. All contact and communication was initiated by me. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, a new branch manager called me and met with me, the first time the bank reached out to me. She was able to figure out what happened. 
The teller payment for XXXX was credited, but the XXXX payment was not, as the bank had failed to unfreeze the account from which the payment was made. The XXXX check had been rejected for reasons unknown. BofA, however, cashed the check for {$320.00} but it was never applied to the VISA. 
Moreover, the bank never terminated the automatic payment of the VISA bills, even though it had frozen the accounts and/or there were eventually no funds. I was told by bank personnel that the autopay would not terminate for 45 days. Throughout this period I received notices of the banks inability to automatically withdraw. 
All the while the bank was charging late payment penalties and interest on the unpaid balance. I also received two collections calls. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX notified me that the bank had filed a delinquency notice on my credit report. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I had two meetings with the current XXXX bank manager at which she presented her personal calculations of what was owed on purchases. Unable to rely on verbal representations, I requested an official letter from the BofA confirming removal of the delinquency notice, deletion of all penalties and interest charges, and the final amount required to completely close out any VISA issues. The bank manager told me a letter would be sent and followed up twice to check on receipt of the letter. Subsequently she conceded that the Bank would not send a letter and referred me to a vice-president in charge of area banks. I spoke to the VP and she indicated that she would look into the matter. Shortly thereafter, I received emails stating the Bank demanded payment of interest on the VISA card. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$2400.00} in cash at the bank representing the remaining amount of actual purchases made with the VISA card. The month before, I had paid {$1100.00} at the specific request of the bank manager. Prior to all this, I have never had a late payment or failed to pay in full in the past ; I refused to pay any of the interest or fees resulting from the Banks neglect and abusive conduct. I did appeal the interest and charges, but the Bank rejected my appeal. 

Contentions : Bank of America ( BofA ) neglected to immediately freeze all accounts to prevent further looting. 
BofA declined my requests for a full accounting of all losses and reimbursements to my accounts. Without this I am unable to determine if I have been made whole. 
BofAs handling of my VISA payments was negligent I did everything a customer would be expected to do, but the bank failed to correctly process and credit payments made in person. 
BofA cashed and deposited but negligently failed to apply check payments towards the VISA balance. 
BofA failed to terminate the automatic payments, and failed to assist with terminating the autopay, knowing the linked accounts had been frozen or had no funds. 
Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, BofA never reached out to communicate with me about these issues. All contact and communication ( at least XXXX times ) were by my calls or visits to the bank branch. 
Until XX/XX/XXXX, no explanation or correction of the corrupted VISA account was provided by the BofA. 
My XX/XX/XXXX request for ( a ) a letter outlining the VISA status, ( b ) removal of penalty charges and interest, and ( c ) removal of the delinquency on my credit status was never complied with, even though the branch manager indicated otherwise. 
In XXXX I paid the entire amount due to the VISA card, as assessed by the branch manager, for purchases made. 
BofA has refused to waive penalties and fees which were assessed due to the Banks negligent handling of the VISA account. 
Bank of Americas negligent handling of my accounts, refusal to comply with my requests for explanations, defamation of my credit status, and resulting collections calls, have caused me physical and emotional distress. The Bank seeks to penalize me for its own negligence, poor practices, and intentional misbehavior."
Credit card or prepaid card,When purchasing from XXXX XXXX  I was unaware the winery was closed. I received an email 1 week before my tour about my cancellation due to the winery being closed. I also was asked if I wanted a voucher. I declined and asked for a refund. I got no response till this day. Due to covid-19 I am tight finically. I feel its unfair to pay for a service I never received. The company failed to let me know they were closed but still selling tickets. I would have never purchased.I was told by the bank they offer no refunds in there policy however Due to the i preempted situation I believe they should have an exemption.
Credit card or prepaid card,"BofA VISA # XXXX ( Stolen VISA CC Account Ending in XXXX ) My credit card was lost/stolen back when I was visiting XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. It had been used at a Jewelry store XXXX XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$9300.00}. 

A police report # XXXX - XXXX has been filed with Office  XXXX, Badge # XXXX, showing that the purchase was not made by me or anyone I know. 

Bank of America is refusing to reimburse for this fraudulent charge stating : "" While you personally didn't make the charge ( s ), we confirmed it was made by an authorized user on the account or someone who has permission to use the card. '' Please refer to the following links ( appropriate sections, copied and pasted below ) : https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1026/13/ # d-4 https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1026/Interp-13/ ( f ) Procedures if different billing error or no billing error occurred. If, after conducting a reasonable investigation, a creditor determines that no billing error occurred or that a different billing error occurred from that asserted, the creditor shall within the time limits in paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) of this section : 13 ( f ) Procedures If Different Billing Error or No Billing Error Occurred 1. Different billing error. Examples of a different billing error include : i. Differences in the amount of an error ( for example, the customer asserts a {$55.00} error but the error was only {$53.00} ). 
ii. Differences in other particulars asserted by the consumer ( such as when a consumer asserts that a particular transaction never occurred, but the creditor determines that only the seller 's name was disclosed incorrectly ). 
2. Form of creditor 's explanation. The written explanation ( which also may notify the consumer of corrections to the account ) may take a variety of forms. It may be sent separately, or it may be included on or with a periodic statement that is mailed within the time for resolution. If the creditor uses the periodic statement for the explanation and correction ( s ), the corrections must be specifically identified. If a separate explanation, including the correction notice, is provided, the enclosed or subsequent periodic statement reflecting the corrected amount may simply identify it as a credit. The explanation may be combined with the creditor 's notice to the consumer of amounts still owing, which is required under 1026.13 ( g ) ( 1 ), provided it is sent within the time limit for resolution. ( See commentary to 1026.13 ( e ). )  3. Reasonable investigation. A creditor must conduct a reasonable investigation before it determines that no billing error occurred or that a different billing error occurred from that asserted. In conducting its investigation of an allegation of a billing error, the creditor may reasonably request the consumer 's cooperation. The creditor may not automatically deny a claim based solely on the consumer 's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request, including providing an affidavit or filing a police report. However, if the creditor otherwise has no knowledge of facts confirming the billing error, the lack of information resulting from the consumer 's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request may lead the creditor reasonably to terminate the investigation. The procedures involved in investigating alleged billing errors may differ depending on the billing error type. 
i. Unauthorized transaction. In conducting an investigation of a notice of billing error alleging an unauthorized transaction under 1026.13 ( a ) ( 1 ), actions such as the following represent steps that a creditor may take, as appropriate, in conducting a reasonable investigation : A. Reviewing the types or amounts of purchases made in relation to the consumer 's previous purchasing pattern. 
B. Reviewing where the purchases were delivered in relation to the consumer 's residence or place of business. 
C. Reviewing where the purchases were made in relation to where the consumer resides or has normally shopped. 
D. Comparing any signature on credit slips for the purchases to the signature of the consumer ( or an authorized user in the case of a credit card account ) in the creditor 's records, including other credit slips. 
E. Requesting documentation to assist in the verification of the claim. 
F. Requiring a written, signed statement from the consumer ( or authorized user, in the case of a credit card account ). For example, the creditor may include a signature line on a billing rights form that the consumer may send in to provide notice of the claim. However, a creditor may not require the consumer to provide an affidavit or signed statement under penalty of perjury as a part of a reasonable investigation. 
G. Requesting a copy of a police report, if one was filed. 
H. Requesting information regarding the consumer 's knowledge of the person who allegedly obtained an extension of credit on the account or of that person 's authority to do so. 
ii. Nondelivery of property or services. In conducting an investigation of a billing error notice alleging the nondelivery of property or services under 1026.13 ( a ) ( 3 ), the creditor shall not deny the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation and determines that the property or services were actually delivered, mailed, or sent as agreed. 
iii. Incorrect information. In conducting an investigation of a billing error notice alleging that information appearing on a periodic statement is incorrect because a person honoring the consumer 's credit card or otherwise accepting an access device for an open-end plan has made an incorrect report to the creditor, the creditor shall not deny the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation and determines that the information was correct. 
( 1 ) Mail or deliver to the consumer an explanation that sets forth the reasons for the creditor 's belief that the billing error alleged by the consumer is incorrect in whole or in part ; ( 2 ) Furnish copies of documentary evidence of the consumer 's indebtedness, if the consumer so requests ; and ( 3 ) If a different billing error occurred, correct the billing error and credit the consumer 's account with any disputed amount and related finance or other charges, as applicable. 

Bank of America has failed to ( or is refusing to ) provide me with documentary evidence on how they have been able to determine "" While you personally didn't make the charge ( s ), we confirmed it was made by an authorized user on the account or someone who has permission to use the card. '' There are a series of steps that a financial institution must take in order to verify the claim ( as described in the links provided ). The type or amount of the purchase made clearly does NOT match my previous purchasing pattern. I had never shopped, or had prior relationship with the merchant. 

Bank of America has failed to provide me with any signature on credit slips, and the signatures have not been compared with my signature in their records. 

As per their request, Bank of America has also been provided with a copy of the filed police report, UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY, however, they have refused to put that into consideration, when reviewing my claim. Declining my claim after a police report has been provided, under penalty of perjury, implies that the bank believes that I was part of the scheme, and simply wanted to make purchases, and not be held liable for them. However, if the bank believes that I have committed fraud, according to law and regulations ( please see, for instance, XXXX : XXXX ), THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES WITH THEM, and my claim must not have been declined for just simply "" having the belief ''. 

It is important to note that Regulation E also expressly prohibits the following factors as the basis for imposing greater liability than is permissible under Regulation E : the consumer was negligent ( e.g., wrote a PIN on an ATM card ) ; an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution provides for greater liability ; or the consumer is liable for a greater amount under state law. 

I, hereby, consider this dispute/complaint still unresolved, and request the help of the CFPB, in getting reimbursement for the unauthorized transactions on my account in the total amount of {$9300.00} using my VISA CC ending in XXXX. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, -XXXX  XXXX BofA VISA # XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I accidentally paid the wrong credit card in my Bank of America account. I have 3 cards, I paid {$8000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX a week later I called and asked them to transfer the payment to the other card. There has been a credit on this account for more than 6 weeks and a debt on the card I want it transferred to. I have called 5 times. I was told last week it would be handled by Friday. It wasnt! I called yesterday and they told me they would call me this am and tell me the status. The did NOT call. This is extremely excessive to transfer a credit balance from one card to another."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Applied a new credit card few months. Forgot to enroll in auto-pay. As a result, late payment ( 36 days ) on the card. As soon as I released my mistake, enrolled in auto-pay and paid the credit card in full. 

Recently a month ago, i tried to refinance my mortgage and the loan officer basically denied my application. He said my credit score was low and would recommend waiting a few month to see if it improves. Credit score dropped to XXXX. 

Checked my credit report, it has "" Derogatory Information '' Derogatory Information 1 Account XXXX Date Reported XXXX Creditor Name Bank Of America Status Open Called the bank in question, they waived off the late fee + interest on the card ( BoA ) But said, they can not do anything w.r.t removing the derogatory remark from the credit report ( tried to talk to 3 different reps, but gained no traction ) Any pointers on how to get rid of this remark/improve my credit score/soften the blow? Costing me close to $ XXXX/month by not taking advantage on refinancing. 

FWIW, In the past few years, my credit score has always been above or close to 800. I have never missed a payment in my 10 years of my credit history. I bought my house a yr ago with credit score of XXXX and got the best possible rate."

I was having issue with there app and called customer support they had told me that i need to cancel the auto pay in order for them to fix the problem and that they would escalate it to another department that handles that now i am 30 days late because of this and they have reduced my credit limit because of there fault. if they didn't make me remove the auto pay it would have covered my {$8.00} late payment and i wouldn't be reported to credit reporting companies there rep should of at least help me setup autopay the right way if they made me cancel the previous one."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am writing regarding a matter that has caused me serious financial ramifications, which could have been prevented had Bank of America been forthcoming with me, and followed their own procedures. On  XXXX  around  XXXX    XXXX   ( give or take an hour ) I inadvertently chose the wrong account during a transfer from my Checking Account (   XXXX   XXXX   ) on Bank of America 's mobile app. I sent {$1100.00} to my Credit Card account rather than my other  Checking Ac count (  XXXX  ). I called Bank of America immediately and spoke with their checking/debit department. The woman, I regret forgetting her name, informed me she had cancelled the transfer and told me I neednt take any further action. She further notified me that my {$1100.00} would appear back in Checking  XXXX , with verification via the mobile app once I refreshed the page. Upon refresh, the {$1100.00} was back in Checking  XXXX . I then completed my transfer from Checking  XXXX  to Checking  XXXX .     The next day (  XXXX  ) I noticed that my Credit Card account had an excess of around {$900.00} and that my Checking XXXX  was now - {$1100.00}. I called the  Checking/Debit D epartment back, explained that the first transfer was cancelled and asked what happened. They sent me to the Credit Card Department where the woman told me that they would be taking the  XXXX  sent to my Credit Card account and send it back to my  Checking  XXXX , balancing everything out. I was told it would take up to 10 days but it usually was a  3-5  day process.     Two days later (  XXXX  ) I checked my accounts to find that my Credit Card account was completely missing from the app, had been closed without my permission, and my Checking XXXX  was then charged  XXXX  {$35.00} fees. On Monday (  XXXX  ) I called again, spoke with the  Checking  Department who after being transferred to a supervisor credited me back the {$70.00} in fees. The supervisor told me that NO  ONE h ad indicated that the first transfer was cancelled or that it was a mistake, no one put notations in whatsoever. I was then transferred to the  Wealth Management  Department. The woman there could n't help me, but she put in a request for an investigation to try and get my Credit Card back open reinstating any balances I owed and have the {$1100.00} sent back to my Checking XXXX . She told me it would take upwards of 2 days.  Sidenote : My Rent  was due  XXXX  and I was waiting for a payment from  XXXX  of my jobs that was sent to  Checking  XXXX  on  XXXX , but since Checking  XXXX   was negative I did n't get the payment from my job. I 'm now facing upwards of {$200.00} in late fees due to having to wait for this Bank to fix this mess.     I received a call on Tuesday  XXXX  from the Investigator, but I was in a meeting. He left me a voicemail with  XXXX  numbers, his direct line and the  Wealth Management d epartment. He would n't answer his direct line, so I left a voice mail and then called the  Wealth Managemen  XXXX  Department again around  XXXX     XXXX  . The woman who answered had no idea what I was talking about, or what I was calling about. She sent me to  XXXX , a Credit Card  specialist.    XXXX  told me of some notes the e investigator l eft in the account. The amounts were guesstimates, I was too upset to remember all the amounts and for that I apologize. He told me "" The investigator left a note here, so please do n't shoot the messenger. We are unable to credit back the full amount as the Credit Card had an overdue balance owed of {$150.00}  (  guesstimate ) but the remaining {$150.00} ( guesstimate ) will be placed back into the credit card account after it has been re-opened and a check of {$950.00}  (  guesstimate ) will be sent. '' He then transferred me to another Credit Card Specialist,  XXXX   XXXX , who was extremely rude and insinuated I had made the error rather than the bank, and made it seem as if I was a criminal trying to scam them, rather than to get access to my own funds.      XXXX   XXXX  informed me that what  XXXX  said was incorrect. She told me that in her ""  nineteen y ears '' of being at Bank of America she had never seen anything like this happen and that they had closed the account because I paid it off. This, of course, despite the fact Bank of America has not had a mobile app for nineteen years. She ignored my explanation that the first original transfer was cancelled and had been a mistake. She was rude and talked down to me, then had the gall to offer me to re-open the CC to start a new line of credit. It was due to her attitude that made me realize I wanted to close all my accounts with Bank of America, and plan to do so at the next opportunity.     The purpose for my complaint is two fold. First, I dont believe anyone should have to go through the hassle, condescending attitude and horrible customer service afforded to me. Secondly, I want to ensure Bank of America refunds any and all fees and charges, apologizes, and assists me in transferring all of my business to another bank.       Please open the attachments I have with  XXXX   XXXX  as I have attached comments next to the highlighted items."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was approved for Maryland Unemployment in connection with being out of work due to COVID-19. I filed for Unemployment with Maryland 's Dept of Labor back in XX/XX/2020 and needed to go through Extensive identity and wages verification. I was mailed a Bank of America Prepaid Debit Card where my COVID-19 Unemployment was to be sent to. When I went to activate the card, I was unable to activate it. I called Bank of America and was told that I needed to contact Maryland Unemployment. I contacted Maryland Unemployment and was told that my benefits were reinstated after I passed the identity verification. True copies of the documents that I received in the mail from Maryland Unemployment are attached to this Complaint which explicitly states that the funds on the B of A Prepaid Card ending in XXXX would be unfrozen within 3 to 4 business days from XX/XX/2020. As of the date of this Complaint, the funds are still frozen. 

I've contacted Bank of America numerous times and have been given no information regarding this issue besides a letter that I received in the mail telling me that my card was being frozen due to some kind of investigation. This occurred even though Maryland Unemployment sent me the notice attached to this Complaint stating that after their formal and official investigation, my identity was verified.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I submitted complaint XXXX a month ago. XXXX, from the Regulatory Complaint Department of Bank of America, left me a voice message indicating he was investigating my issue. 

I returned his call immediately to the number provided ( XXXX ), and the automated voice message says, "" thank you for calling regulatory complaints servicing, we are here to help, please be advised we are a DEBT COLLECTOR. '' I entered XXXX 's 6-digit extension ( XXXX ), and the call went straight to voicemail. I did not hear anything back after several days, so I called XXXX again, and it went straight to voicemail again. Over the next few weeks, I left several messages for XXXX but never got a response. There was no alternative extension provided, so I was stuck leaving voicemails for XXXX and never getting a response. 

Finally, today, I received a voicemail from XXXX, from the same department as XXXX. I tried calling him back, but it went straight to voicemail, just like XXXX. There is no operating menu, and no option to speak with an operator. 

The department is a farce. 

The complaints management organization, run by 'Regulatory Complaints Servicing, ' is targeting unsuspecting customers for information, not helping them. Customers facing financial hardships submit complaints to the CFPB thinking that it will help, but they end up divulging data to a Debt Collector that aids the bank in its collection efforts. 

More fortunate customers are not over-burdened by their liabilities, so the debt collectors have no incentive to call them back. However, low income customers call this debt collector to discuss complaints, thinking that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is protecting them! Instead, they are waiving their rights unbeknownst. 

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) prohibits debt collectors from using abusive, unfair, or deceptive practices to collect debts. The FDCPA covers debt for personal, family or household purposes. Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is someone who regularly collects debts owed to others, such as a collection agency. A bank collecting its own debt in its own name is not considered a debt collector and may attempt to collect debts owed in a reasonable manner, including telephone calls to the borrower. However, banks and other lenders that are not acting as debt collectors under FDCPA are generally expected to avoid abusive collection practices and comply with the spirit of the FDCPA. 

The Regulatory Complaints Servicing department is violating the spirit of the FDCPA, and under the auspices of the CFPB! By employing Unfair, Deceptive ( or Abusive ) Acts or Practices, it collects complaints, probably scans for key words, and targets groups of people. Their process probably violates Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) if debt collectors are profiling customers and selecting specific groups of people to pursue for further information. And if they are misusing credit report information for the purposes of debt collection, they may be violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Consumers need their data need to be protected, not manipulated and forfeited under false pretenses. 

The CFPB should be protecting customers, not feeding them to the wolves."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Saturday morning XX/XX/XXXX, I was alerted through the Bank of America Mobile Banking app that there was suspicious activity on my card and to check the account. I logged onto the app and saw 4 unfamiliar transactions from Friday XX/XX/XXXX that had posted that morning. I had the card in question in my physical possession, but those purchases were not made by me. 

I immediately processed those 4 charges are fraud through the app, then called Bank of America. Bank of America confirmed that the fraud claim was received through the app, the charges in question were temporarily credited, they closed my current card, a new card was mailed to me, and an investigation into the fraud would be opened. I continued to monitor my account, but no further fraud transactions were made. I received the new card and continued making purchases business as usual. 
On Sunday XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed in my Mobile Banking app that the fraud charges were reinstated as fees on my account. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called Bank of Americas fraud customer service . I opted for a callback and kept my place in line. They called me back at XXXX. I was advised that the charges were validated because they determined that the cards chip was actually inserted at the point of sale. Because I was in possession of the card at the time of the fraudulent purchase, and the representative said that it was virtually impossible to replicate a chip, they reversed the fraud claim and charged me. 

I asked about next steps to fix this. The representative advised that Bank of America would reopen my fraud claim for further investigation. She also said that I could file a police report and let Bank of America know the police report number once it was filed. I filed police report # XXXX with Detective XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and this information was shared with Bank of America immediately. 
I also filed an identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission today, Monday XX/XX/XXXX.

These are in the area where I live, but I have never visited either store. I reviewed my bank statements for all of XXXX and confirmed that the only purchases made at either store were these fraudulent transactions in question.

I advised the agent that I would be filing a CFPB complaint today."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received a letter in the mail from Bank of America stating "" if you want us to review your application for the card, please remove the restriction on your credit report and call us within the next 30 days. '' Since neither my spouse nor I applied for this card, I called my ID theft protect company for guidance. I was worried that even though this application was stopped, someone still has enough of my personal information to apply for a card. 

My ID rep called Bank of America with me, who shared that while they did try to pull credit reports for this card application, they were declined outright. 

My ID rep gave me several steps to do regarding this incident, including notifying the Federal Trade Commission."

When I was eventually connected to the claims department eventually the operator asked me to hold after asking a few account ownership questions. Moments passed with no speaking ... I asked if she was still helping me and the call suddenly dropped at exactly XXXX PST. 

It is impossibly difficult to get through and once getting an agent on the phone it seems that a game is played."

Nevertheless, now the ignorant, no only has made erroneous claims that I have been paying late, but they have rounded up my balance due, pilfering or embezzling {$0.00} from me. This is absolutely egregious. If they have any authority to do "" cash rounding '' - a phrase I found via XXXX. If they do, then they are likely generating millions by robbing millions of people across the country and State of Michigan of our personal property : quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies every month. Just imagine what they are doing to grandmothers, and single mothers who just are too occupied to pay the attention necessary to identify these unscrupulous activities. I paid their late fee. I paid their interest rate.

Then, they closed my account and sent me an email letting me know that they closed it and that I would receive a letter in the mail. I called their "" 800 '' number and spoke to someone who was incompetent and not able to assist me. A few days later, a letter from Bank of America somehow mysteriously showed up in my mailbox.

Credit card or prepaid card,"This is the letter I wrote to my bank in response to the merchant : Account number ending in : XXXX Case number : XXXX It is difficult to respond to the merchant because the merchant has made no effort to investigate the return. The merchant has included a copy of the original online invoice. There is no dispute that an order was placed. 
The merchant has included proof of delivery. XXXX confirms that the billing, and shipping address match. Again, there is no dispute that an order was placed, and delivered. The issue at hand is that XXXX has made a simple transaction into an unnecessary ordeal. They have failed to issue a return for their product. One that was returned in a timely manner according to their own instructions, using their own carrier. 
I placed the order on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a XXXX, and decided to gift it for XXXX because there was free return shipping ( see image 1 ). 
I had contacted XXXX by phone to inquire about the return. I was told that I would receive an email if I could return the items. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX ( see image 2 ).  Shortly after I received an email from XXXX with the return label ( see image 3 ). 
There is no tracking information in this email. It is presumably because of the length of time that has passed. The tracking number on the label I printed out was : XXXX ( see image 4 ). This USPS return label ( in partnership with XXXX ) provides a tracking history that proves that the return was in the possession of USPS on  XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. By XX/XX/XXXX it was picked up, and processed by the shipping agent ( see image 5 ). The date today is XX/XX/XXXX. There are no circumstances by which this sort of mishandling should be excused. 
There is definitive proof that the XXXX items were returned according to the merchants return policy. The fact is that when I had been in contact with XXXX, they showed zero initiative in assisting their customers, so I am incredibly disappointed. I will be sure to make note of my experience to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and will resort to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if this issue is not resolved by the merchant, or the bank.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I'm on XXXX and the State of New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development  sent a debit card that I never received. It got stolen and I reported it to Bank of America. They even sent me a letter saying that the the card has been subjected of fraud. The amount stolen was {$4400.00} and the Bank of America sent me a new card but with only {$22.00} left on the card. The bank did not put the said amount to my new card and closed the case even after admitting it was all stolen. I've been calling numerous times. I spoke to a lot of people but I lost some of their names. They usually tell me to wait, hang up, reopen the case, or that I will be getting the money the end of the month of XXXX. The recent people I spoke to was XXXX who says I will be getting a letter from Bank of America. Then I spoke to XXXX who says they'll reopen the claim and to wait. Then just spoke to XXXX and he said I will get a call back from the supervisor. I mean this is a horrible bank and how can they say all these lies to a customer whose money was stolen. They have no conscience ; it's pandemic and I'm really hoping u can help me please. Thank you. Sorry about the mess on the letter, I take notes on it from the calls."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, my husband received an email from Bank of America ( BofA ) notifying us of a pending balance transfer of nearly {$5000.00} that neither my husband nor I had initiated ( from a credit card that neither of us has! ). We immediately called BofA and let them know that this was "" not us '' so to speak. The first customer service rep we spoke to said that we needed to talk to someone from the sales department since they initiate balance transfers so we waited patiently while we were transferred. We went through the story again and the person from the sales dept said that they could see that transfer pending ( they even saw the amount that was noted in the initial email ) and that they would need to transfer us to the fraud department. Again, a wait for the transfer, and again, we go through the explanation of why we are calling. The rep from the fraud department, however, could not see that pending transfer and couldn't explain why we got that initial email and said the email was likely fake ( I note that there were no links or other typical phishing related items in the email ). So they said that there was no action they could take. We were therefore surprised that we got another email the next morning, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, that some transactions were flagged as suspicious. My husband then logged into our BofA account and confirmed our actual transactions and flagged the balance transfer as not having been initiated by us. A couple hours later, we received an email stating that our balance request had been processed! We were flabbergasted! 

I sent an email to XXXX XXXX, President of Retail Banking at BofA, on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, with the above information and asking for them to immediately credit our account for the fraudulent amount and asking how this could have happened since we spoke with XXXX people letting them know this was fraud and used there online system to flag it as fraud. I received a call on Thursday from someone who works for XXXX who explained that they would investigate the fraud but it could take up to 2 months and that the fraudulent amount would be put "" on hold '' in the meantime, though not credited back to us until the investigation is complete. I was told repeatedly by this person that there was "" nothing they could do '' once the transfer was initiated. This despite the fact that we told 3 people and used their online features to let them know this was fraud. I maintained that they could have done something, but they chose not to, or more precisely, their processes would not allow them. And this is the change in their process that I would like to see, that transactions are put on hold while the fraud is investigated versus let them go through and then investigate."

For some reason after have this card for years they suddenly closed the account without warning. This card was kept for purchases and possibly emergency situations. The card was in good standings but for some unknown reason, the bank decided to close it. As a result, this caused my credit score to drop. Sure, over all those years of having the card, I faced some hardships like many other people do but I was not late on the account many times. Nor before closing the account, had I been late for some time. The account was being used responsibly and had an ending balance of XXXX. So I'm trying to understand why would they close this?

I got my password in the physical mail this week. However in order to get payment processed I had to get deposits to my account and report them to bank of America. By the time I could make a payment ( today ) the annual fee is past due making my card unusable and generating an additional fee. 

When I called the company and explained that I posted payment ( not processed ) and I could not have made payment any sooner due to their own system of payment, they told me nothing could be done and I needed to pay the fee and wait for payment to clear.

I spent hours on hold with BOA when I finally got through to them they told me what I would need to get it resolved. They told me I would need a death certificate a copy of my bill pay showing the payment and a letter explaining what happened. I provided them with all that information faxed it to them as well as emailed it. They acknowledge the payment of XXXX is in the closed account.

Further, the account was compromised and debits continued to be made to the account after having reported several times fraud as their department failed to prevent the unauthorized party to continue to make charges to the account. I have presented my concerns to several parties representing Bank of America, who did not address the concerns of fraud and identity theft appropriately and instead made request for payment for a debt that is not mine. I have requested that the monies that were debited from the account as a result of fraud be credited to the account and the accounts have been close at my request.

Credit card or prepaid card,"This complaint is in regards to my B of A XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX. On XX/XX/20 I logged into my account and noted two charges that were not mine. I immediately tried calling the B of A dispute number provided on the web page ( XXXX ). I was put in a queue that neither told me how long the wait was, or what number customer I was in line. Periodically, between awful musak, a message reminded me to "" Continue to hold and I will be answered by the next associate '' and that "" Your call is important to us ''. During the time I was on hold, several more fraudulent charges appeared on my account. I was able to suspend the account/card on my own ( with no assistance from B of A ) during this time. After over 2 hours of MY time on hold, I gave up and ended the call. 

Over the next two days I tried to call several times to this number and another number ( XXXX ) also provided by B of A. Several ~ 2hour waits on hold ( again with no information about the queue ) resulted in the call being dropped/ended by B of A without my being able to speak with anyone there. I tried also to call the regular customer service number provided on the back of the card ( XXXX ). Here I had to provide my debit card number, and last four digits of my social security number. Then provide the card number several times to the customer service associate I reached, followed by D.O.B. address, phone, and a security question. Twice I reached someone and was told they could not help, but offered to transfer me back to the line I had already tried to call unsuccessfully which I explained would not help in any way. The last time I called, I demanded to speak to a supervisor and was transferred to "" XXXX '' in the fraud department. 

XXXX seemed to understand my frustration and after again asking security related questions, offered to transfer me using an "" internal '' number that isn't given out to customers to get me in touch with someone to resolve this situation. I was again put on hold and heard the familiar recording ( "" Continue to hold and I will be answered by the next associate '' and that "" Your call is important to us '' ). After ~ 90+ MORE minutes on hold I again gave up and plan to call customer service again. 

This problem follows other issues with B of A including their arbitrary cancellation of one of my credit card accounts that i did not want and that they refused to fix ( an account that was 15 yrs old ) and the company 's charging me {$12.00} a month for the privilege of having another credit/debit account with them. Because I have a relatively low balance, B of A feels they can charge ( steal ) {$12.00} a month from me. This complaint should reach XXXX XXXX and various people in departments from customer service, fraud, debit cards, and software/programming should ALL be FIRED"

I called Bank of America today at XXXX to cancel. They said a request was made to send another card to Kansas. I live in Louisiana. They said they did not send a card to Kansas, they knew something was wrong. I looked at my credit report online and it does not show I applied for a credit card. The guy I spoke to at Bank of America said that people will add negative information about phone numbers so people will think its a scam."

When I went to access the account and transfer the money to my checking account, I found the account had been closed. Both NV XXXX and Bank of America repeatedly told me it was the other party 's fault. Eventually I found out that my card had been closed for suspected fraud. When I filed my next weekly claim to be paid out XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that payment was not released because I needed to confirm my identity with XXXX. When I called XXXX nobody could tell me how to do that. Luckily the next week I started a new job so those two weeks of payment were the only weeks I did not receive. Finally I emailed copies of my license and my passport to XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX was notified that the hold had been released from my account and my XXXX XXXX XXXX Pending resolution had been removed from my account. It showed my final unemployment payment had been issued. That payment was a partial payment of {$630.00} combined federal and state benefits to rectify a previous accidental overpayment ( due to a vacation time issue ). I went to the Bank of America website to check my balance and found the account was still closed. The XXXX fraud phone number has been disconnected- I can't get through. The XXXX main phone line refuses to let me talk to a representative or receive a callback. When I called Bank of America about this issue they claimed that it was XXXX 's problem again, but since XXXX has clearly released the hold on my account and released payment to BofA, I have no choice but to understand the situation as BofA unlawfully holding my payment and refusing to release my money to me. The most recent time I tried to contact BofA about this they hung up on me with no discussion. The total amount I am owed is XXXX and it has been six months that this money has been withheld from me."
Credit card or prepaid card,"We had a leak from our roof and the insurance company sent a check in both my husbands name and mine, I checked to be sure I could do a mobile deposit that the check amount was not too much and it wasn't. We both signed the check and I deposited into my bank account and got confirmation that it was accepted. The next day the money was gone and we are talking $ XXXX. I called Bank of America and was informed it was the insurance company. When I got to work, I called the insurance co and they said it was not them. I called a local branch of BOA and was informed it was because my husbands name was not on the account. We made an appt and went down that day to add his name. We were told we had to wait for a letter in the mail and then come back down. This was about 4-5 day delay. We received a letter from BOA and we went immediately to the bank and was then informed it was not the letter that we would get another one. No way we were told there would be 2 letters. In the meantime we had the roofing contractors here as weather was changing and we were trying to work in between rainy days. I had to go take money out of my account ( this $ XXXX was not back yet ) and get a cash advance on my credit card. I had no other choice as the contractors had to get paid. It was later remembered that I did a mobile deposit so there fore I had the check and then I was told to come back down to redeposit it. I could have done that a week before but they told us I had to wait for a letter. I don't feel I should be penalize {$160.00} cash advance fee when all of the errors were committed by employees of BOA. It was one error after another. They never sent me an email or text stating why the money was removed. All it said on my account was amount correction. I get text and email alerts on transactions of less and this should have been a phone call. I have tried to talk with BOA branch employees and they tell me its the credit department that has to waive the fee. When I called the credit department they said it was a legitimate charge that they did not make the error but I said you are all BOA employees so I still feel the charge should be removed. I want this account closed but I am not paying that fee. I already paid back the cash advance so this fee is the only thing on the card."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America insisted that I make large payments on my credit card during the Era of Bank Aggression which I did. After many payments over the time frame which Bofa set up they claimed that I owed a little more to them as they had miscalculated the payment amount. That amount they turned over to apparently one of their collectors. I agreed to pay the remaining amount. The agency said that after I made all the payments required that I owed, so I agreed to pay which was about {$200.00}. The bank accepted the payment, but they said it did not matter that Bofa had been paid {$30000.00} from me, I was over thirty days late and had not been given an additional bill as I had paid five years and they had gotten all their money. No, Bofa had made an addition error and I NEEDED to pay the remainder which I did. The agency then said that I would be negatively impacted on my credit score for seven years regardless of the mistake of Bofa. I have proof that I tried to correct the error in XXXX. It is still on my report. They have been paid in full, but took to a punitive route after they got XXXX. 
I could not get loans are refi my home or get a car. They still will not remove the negatives."

I have 2 loans with B of A and by XX/XX/2021 {$2800.00} was due for the purchases and this was paid prior to that date therefore the only debt that remained was for the Direct Deposit of {$4400.00} at 1.99 %. 

My TOTAL monthly interest charge in XXXX should not exceed the monthly interest rate of 1.99 % for the {$4400.00} owed which would be less than {$8.00}. 

I would appreciate it very much if you would credit my account with the proper amount.

I have tried to resolve the issue with BofA for almost XXXX months now. Employees keep giving me conflicting information. I am told to do one thing and then transferred to another person that tells me something different. It is like no one really knows what they are doing. BofA also declined to approve my fraud claim because they said the money was transferred to an account in my name. This is how the fraud happened. But, when I call to speak to one cohesive department they tell me I can only speak to credit card department that is separate from Checking department. Both departments give me the run around. I have spent hours on hold and being transferred from department to department. I believe I am a victim of a new type of fraud, but BofA won't tell me why or how they let someone open XXXX linked accounts. Was it digitally or did they do it in person? I want to see the credit applications that were submitted but they are also giving me the runaround. They have been very difficult to deal with and now they are expecting me to pay over XXXX as a result of being a victim. The person submitted an incorrect birthday from what one BofA employee told me and therefore BofA is to blame for allowing someone access to so much money in my name. I don't know who else I can speak to to help me resolve this issue. I believe BofA is purposefully trying to make it so difficult so that I give up and just pay the money that was stolen."

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I instructed XXXX XXXX Online via bill pay to send {$410.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, DE XXXX. The payment came from my personal checking account to pay a general credit card bill, a XXXX 's XXXX card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the electronic payment was made by XXXX XXXX. 

In the next month, when my XXXX 's XXXX card failed, I realized my error. I should have instructed XXXX XXXX to send the payment to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AL XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I filed an inquiry with XXXX XXXX in reference to the bill pay payment and was assigned a case number. 

I was instructed by phone to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX to give permission for XXXX XXXX to represent me and work on my behalf and I did so, learning then, however, that XXXX XXXX XXXX represented Bank of America accounts, not XXXX. I understood through questions and answers that perhaps some Bank of America/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  sale/purchase had possibly occurred. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX notified me it was attempting to solve the issue and would contact XXXX XXXX XXXX/BOA on my behalf, would initiate a conference call if necessary, and would send me updated information. XXXX XXXX said it was unable to stop the payment or have the {$410.00} in question refunded to my checking account. 

Also on on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX informed me it had refunded a late fee I incurred by missing my payment to XXXX. The amount was {$37.00} as reimbursement. 

Once I realized the long amount of time that had passed since my original error, I contacted, by telephone, XXXX XXXX, which indeed initiated a conference call on my behalf to XXXX XXXX XXXX. It lasted approximately 90 minutes or more with the XXXX XXXX representative saying she had talked to as many as seven XXXX XXXX XXXX  representatives and asked them to address my concerns. XXXX XXXX XXXX, aka apparently Bank of America, could not locate any account with my name nor any account with the numbers listed on the bill pay payment that was sent. XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to allow XXXX XXXX to send proof of payment then and would not provide a fax number to the XXXX XXXX employee representing me to fax such proof. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX informed me via email it had contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and confirmed my payment had been received and that XXXX XXXX XXXX was in the process of refunding me the {$410.00}. XXXX XXXX wrote the following in that email : To assist XXXX XXXX XXXX in locating this payment, we have mailed them a proof of payment along with a refund request to Bank of America, Attention : Payment Research XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. Please allow 7 business days to receive this request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX to follow up because no repayment had been credited to my account. Additionally, I had understood on XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX XXXX XXXX, aka Bank of America, had not been cooperative and had refused proof of payment. XXXX XXXX initiated a conference call at my request on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX/BOA. At that time, XXXX/BOA could not help me, the representative, XXXX, said because I do not have a Bank of American account with them. This representative said one of three supervisors would call me on XX/XX/XXXX before XXXX, which did not happen. 

Also on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX representative recommended I seek legal action. Toward that end, I contacted the state attorney general 's office where I spoke with a representative of the Department of Business Oversight who directed me to XXXX, which oversees national banks. XXXX, however, referred me to the CFPB since this was related to a personal checking account. I contacted CFPB and spoke with XXXX, a representative, who recommended filing a complaint, instructing that online is the fasted and most effective method. 

Surely I am not the first person to click a wrong payee and have money go missing. I find it hard to believe that this has not happened before. I made a mistake. I asked my bank to send {$410.00} to an incorrect payee. What that payee was contacted, it has refused to refund my money. 

What recourse do I have? I am grateful the amount is no more than {$410.00}. But that amount represents a lot of money to me. 

While I feel XXXX XXXX has done what it can to help me and has advocated admirably, I would like to file a complaint against it as well because this originated with my personal checking account and bill pay service, which I misunderstood as a check-writing service instead of a wire or money transfer. 

I am most concerned over the lack of response from XXXX XXXX XXXX/BOA and its apparent lack of procedure for accidental monetary receipt as well as its disregard for seeking any kind of remedy that would refund my money. 

I would like to submit supporting documentation by mail if necessary. Most records are electronic and should be available through XXXX XXXX."

Credit card or prepaid card,"FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY Regarding : Case # XXXX and # XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX To Whom it May Concern In mid XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by BOA regarding possible fraudulent activity on my 2 BOA credit cards. Unknown to me, this activity had been happening for months. I told the BOA rep that I was totally unaware of this activity, as I had not been monitoring my statements like I should unfortunately. They were all from XXXX and all random amounts dating back like 6 months ago. Let me explain, I have two BOA credit cards. One of which had a larger balance and one with a smaller balance. I put the VISA card with the larger balance in my drawer, stopped using it and then just made payments each month trying to slowly pay it down. Since I was not charging on it, I did not see any point to continue to monitor the statement, as I knew I would only be able to make small monthly payments. This card was never set up to make XXXX Purchases. In regards to the smaller balance one, my BOA Mastercard, I used this card mainly for monthly expenses and some XXXX purchases and I had it set up on my XXXX  device. It stressed me out to see these large balances month to month and not be able to pay them down quickly, so I stopped reviewing the statements and just made payments through my bank each month, not thinking that someone would steal my information and was charging on them. I realize now that I need to monitor my account VERY CLOSELY and have since opened an acct on line with BOA to review monthly charges. I would just pay what I would spend each month and just resolved myself to not being able to pay down the balance until I got my tax refund in XXXX, which I just received recently. Therefore, I just did make an approx. {$3400.00} payment on the smaller acct ( MC ) to try and pay it off. From what I understand, criminals start try to charge small amounts and if they notice you dont stop it and you did not notice, they will continue to make charges. This is what happened in my case. On the VISA, they charged in XXXX  and then nothing else and then in MAY made A LOT of XXXX purchases, which is what prompted BOA to take notice. All these charges are related to XXXX, that is where my account got compromised. I only use XXXX  for XXXX  storage and my XXXX yr old daughter -I will authorize $ XXXX to buy XXXX  outfits, I dont ever spend any significant amount of money with XXXX. For any XXXX  $ money to be spent, I have to put in a password that only I know. These charges are 100 % FRAUD and need to be removed ASAP. Had the BOA rep not called me, this would have still been going on until just recently when I checked the balance to try and pay off the smaller card. I did recently notice that the person is still trying to use my CC, even after it was canceled. They tried to make an XXXX  purchase for {$46.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$46.00} XXXX, when my BOA CC was canceled in mid May. ( see screen shot below ) Please let me know what other info you need. I filed a claim in MAY when BOA contacted me and it was closed stating that it was consistent with past activity, however I requested it be reopened as its only consistent with past activity because this has been happening for at least 6 months. Again I had NO IDEA of who is doing this and I need this removed. These cards have since been shut down and closed. What other info do you need to get this resolved? 
I have also contacted XXXX  directly, but they can only go back till early May, they said to go through my CC company for anything prior to that.

I asked for details and asked if my letter that I send back in mid XXXX was received. The person had no idea, hence why I resending this letter, now to this PO box . I hope someone sees this. I need to have a case manager assigned to this case and some one from back office to call me personally at XXXX. I did not make these charges, I was not monitoring my CC stmt, hence why I did not catch this and it went in for longer than it found. BOA alerted me to the fraud, so can now BOA be saying it is not fraud, it makes no sense. What do I need to do to attest this, write a certified letter??? This is so frustrating, the denial letter sent is generic and has no details. All the charges are from XXXX. I only use XXXX for XXXX  storage for the most part and a few small charges herewhere these came from. and there. What do I need to do to prove this. What proof do you have that I made these charges? There has got to be a way to determine I would like to see specifics. I have explained the pattern. What else do you need? 
XXXX XXXX I started by reporting the fraud regarding XXXX charges to XXXX and BOA. XXXX is only able to dispute charges back two months, so I reported the XXXX charges to BOA. BOA opened a claim and then within one month closed the file. They said they charges were similar to purchases made in the past, I told them I had not been monitoring the charges and had no idea of the issue, until BOA called me to report the fraud. So how can BOA state its fraud but another dept state in BOA state that is is not. I called them back to reopen the claim a 2nd time and sent the above letter to them, then on XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a letter stating that their decision had not changed. I had asked them to call me and assign a person to my file that I could talk to, then never contacted me, just received a 2nd denial letter in the mail. I have canceled both cards that were being used, I am not sure what else I can do. I did not make these XXXX charges. I told them the only thing I authorized for storage renewal for XXXX, not all these random amounts."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Today I logged into my Bank of America online account and noticed that I had an XXXX XXXX credit card was listed as an active account in my portfolio. I also noticed that there was a past due balance of {$90.00}. 

I went into this account and saw that it was opened some time in XXXX, 2022. I called Bank of America to ask about why this was showing up in my list of accounts and the person I spoke to said I needed to talk to another department. He transferred me but I was on hold for 30 minutes and no one came to the line so I hung up, not able to resolve this serious matter. 

Bank of America had fraudulently opened this card without my knowledge or consent and then made an unauthorized charge to the card and I had no idea either transaction had taken place. I think there is a legal and moral issue in play here I'm hoping someone takes this matter seriously enough to do something about it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Im writing today to provide details as they pertain to the issue with my Bank of America credit card that was closed by them -- with absolutely no notice to me -- on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Eighteen years ago, I opened my first credit card, with my father cosigning as guarantor. For eighteen years, I made my payments on time, monitored my usage carefully, and never went over my credit limit. I very carefully built my credit, and very intentionally kept this card open and in good standing, as I know how much the average age of credit can impact a credit score. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, evidently Bank of America decided they needed more information about my father ( just address and phone number, nothing major ), who has not moved in five years or changed phone numbers in 20 years. It having been so long since the account was opened, and given how little information they required from him upon opening the line of credit, all they had retained as far as his information was one of my old addresses, at which he never lived. 

BOA claims they sent a single letter to an address at which my father never lived, and at which I have not lived for seven years. ( Note that they randomly updated his address to mine when I lived at the address mentioned above, but not, for some reason, when I moved into my current home, which I have owned and inhabited for seven years. ) When that letter obviously went unseen and unanswered, they unilaterally closed my XXXX year old account with absolutely no notice to me of any kind, which they openly acknowledge. This means no letters, email, or phone calls at all. I discovered the account was closed via a credit monitoring alert from XXXX. 

Ive spoken at length with bank representatives, both over the phone and in person at a branch. All have claimed that there is absolutely no way the card can be reopened, which is simply bank policy, and have offered no recourse for my severely damaged credit. My average age of credit has dropped from nine years to 3, and my available credit has suffered hugely as well. My credit score has dropped into Fair for the first time I can remember -- at least 15 years. My husband and I share a car and were about to apply for an auto loan. That's no longer possible. This has had severe and real-world consequences for me, through no fault of my own."
Credit card or prepaid card,"To Whom It May Concern, My name is XXXX XXXX, I am a XXXXyear-old man whose life has been greatly affected by Covid-19. Looking for work has been very challenging due to these unforeseen circumstances. On XX/XX/2020 A potential employer ; XXXX XXXX who stated worked for XXXX XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX Department emailed me about a potential job opportunity. We spoke about the position available and in the end seemed like the perfect job opportunity for me. A couple of days go by and I received an email from him stating he was offering me a 4-week paid training period that included studying and taking exams for this position. Explained that payment would be made at the end of the four week training period. Upon passing all exams, they would be sending me to their New York office after completing the training to start all the new hire onboarding paperwork and hands on training. I accepted the offer. After 2 weeks into the training, he offered me a XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX to complete if I wanted to earn extra income. They informed me that accepting this project, I would be viewed as a better potential candidate for this position. They wanted me to buy some new XXXX XXXX XXXX for their new office they are opening in XXXX. They were going to wire me {$7100.00} as available credit on my Bank of America Credit Card. That {$7100.00} was for the purchase of XXXX, XXXX & XXXX, and my {$400.00} bonus for this project. I waited for the wire to go through and for the bank to release the funds ( Called and confirmed with Bank of America that fund had been released ). After about 5 days, the funds were released from Bank of America and showed available to use on my credit account. I went on my computer and purchased the laptops. Upon receiving the laptops, I drove down to XXXX   and had them shipped to the address they provided me on their purchase order ( attached in supporting documents XXXX. 

A couple days later I was able to study up for the next exam that was due that Friday. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Forwarded me another purchase order to order more laptops to have sent to their New Office. I accepted. I was very hesitant and repeatedly asked XXXX if this job opportunity was legitimate. I specifically asked him if this is fraudulent. After four weeks of studying and exams, I was reassured multiple times that this was a promising opportunity via email and phone calls. This time, the wire transfer would be {$13000.00}. I asked XXXX if they could send the funds as a paper check instead of wire transfer. He said they could not because this is the way their corporate office did their business in XXXX. End result, they submitted the wire transfer to my Bank of America credit card again. Bank of America at this point would not release the funds. They let us know that this was a scam. They said they see these types of situations all the time and that I am a victim of someone committing fraud. The funds that XXXX XXXX released through XXXX XXXX Bank of America before XXXX {$7100.00} was returned. So now that I have already bought computers and shipped them, I am now responsible to pay Bank of America {$7100.00}. The Bank of America Representative on the phone let me know that I need to make an in person appointment with a Financial Representative to go through my options and to find out if Bank of America released those funds to begin with or If XXXX released those funds. Bank of America is saying this is all my wrongdoing and I am responsible to pay all this money back. I made an appointment with a Financial Representative with Bank of America in hopes to find a resolution to this scam. He let me know that I need to call XXXX and have them call Bank of America to find out who released the {$7100.00} wire transfer fund without investigating it. I filed a claim with the fraud department, I called the police department, I have called and probably spoke with more than XXXX individuals about this problem. Nobody seems to want to help me. 

I called XXXX. They will NOT call Bank of America while a claim investigation is open. After MANY phone calls, I got the same answer. This was all my fault, or you need to file another claim, or you need to talk to this person. I tried to call one more time. I FINALLY was able to get through to someone who cared about this terrible experience I went through. I filed another claim and was told I would be getting a letter in the mail which would explain if they would help me through this or if I would have to pay back a {$7100.00} fraud charge. It has been over a week and I still have not received anything in the mail from them. Just statements that remind me I am a victim and I am still being charged. Being a long time customer of Bank of America, I was surprised and absolutely dismayed that they did not consider helping or resolving this matter with myself and XXXX. As a XXXX old man trying to take care of my wife and XXXX XXXX daughter during these unprecedented times, I simply can not afford this {$7100.00} fraud charge that has been pulled on me. Bank of America and XXXX are multi-billion dollar corporations, I am a single person who genuinely wanted to work and support my family. This experience has caused me severe mental distress to the point where my medical professional has recommended that I seek your help and anyone in the state government that could possibly shed light on this situation that seems to be increasing with people who are unemployed, desperately looking for work, and being taken advantage of. At my age, I feel extremely vulnerable. I have been unemployed for over a year. As you may surmise I am overwhelmingly discouraged and beaten down. 
I am praying and hoping that this email reaches the appropriate folks within your group. I have exhausted all other options and am very desperate for a miracle from your team. Please help me as this is not something me, nor my family can afford at this time. I look forward to hearing back from your team on my unfortunate problem. I look forward to your reply/help in the upcoming weeks. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX"

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had two Bank of America credit cards. I stopped using the cards more than two years ago because in my opinion Bank of America has the biggest liars in XXXX XXXX that I have ever dealt with. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/20XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and spoke with a BofA customer representative by the name of XXXX. I asked XXXX why my credit card interest rate had increased from approximately 15.99 % to 20.24 % in a year. XXXX said that the rates were in line with credit card rates, paraphasing, and this is the reason for the jump in interest rates. This is the only credit card that I have that had such a high jump in interest rates. I stopped using Bank of America credit cards for over two years ago and was paying them off monthly with more than the minimum payment each month with only one late payment because I lost the coupon sent. This is the only credit card that I have had that has such an unusual high jump in interest rates and I have had credit cards from BofA before and paid it off monthly the same as this one. The reason why I stopped using BofA credit cards is because of the liars XXXX XXXX, Chair of the Board and CEO sent to me when I requested a mortgage refinance when Countrywide was given to BofA according to reports and he sent nothing but liars to, so call work with me, and they did nothing but lie and I still have the documents to prove it. The credit card ends in XXXX with the latest high interest rates."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am trying to settle a debt with Bank of America from XXXX. I have talked to numerous people on the phone and gotten different answers from everyone. I have offered to settle my old debt, but my offer has been denied. I was offered another settlement amount ( which is more than I can afford ), and monthly payments. The people I have spoken to said that this will not help me with my credit and will not help with me with my goal of buying a house. I have paid off all old debts, except this account, and seem to be getting nowhere with the company. I think the worst part is that I can't get them to send me anything in the mail saying what my options are for taking care of this old debt. The rep on the phone this morning ( in the recovery dept. ) said BoA doesn't send out letters. How can I possibly resolve this old debt and rebuild my financial life when I'm getting so many different answers and can't get anything in writing?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"received notice that someone ordered a credit report. it was bank of america. someone applied for and opened a credit card in my name. it has been closed and a fraud statement issued, bank of america said i could be told how that application was made but after 7 phone transfers i do not have that info. i NEED to know if it was an online application, phone request or mail in so i can determine the extent of this fraud."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Dear CFPB, et al, I have been unable to receive my unemployment benefits under the Disaster Declaration Act for Nevada which is supposed to provide relief for citizens of Nevada. The lack of compliance by XXXX and the Bank of America has put me in the poor house and made me practically destitute, begging from friends and family for survival. My car is close to being repossessed and my roommate is ready to kick me out for not paying XXXX rent. Holding my money back seems to me to be a violation of my Civil Rights. I want to know when these two agencies will allow me to have my money that I am entitled to. Ive worked hard as a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for 30 years, and I put money into the system which allows me to draw from it during times like this. 
There has been absolutely no fraud on my account, per XXXX. Yet, Bank of America CLOSED my account ( as opposed to frozen ) on XX/XX/2021. I went to the bank and spoke to the branch manager, XXXX XXXX, who seemed bothered that I had even asked for help. She tried to open my account by verifying my identity, but to no avail. She said it was XXXXs fault. She said XXXX told them to close my account. Subsequently, the payment that was made to me on XX/XX/2021 which says paid was taken back out when the account was closed. XXXX XXXX said that XXXX took it back, and that this money was now in their possession which was owed to me. 
Obviously, my next step was to call XXXX and tell them what Bank of America purported. I recorded this call and an unemployment rep said there was no problem with my account, and that there had been no reports of fraud or overpayments in regards to my account with them. They said they CANT CLOSE my account ; that only the bank can do that which makes absolute sense. They said they didnt take my money back out. They said that they dont have that ability. XXXX said that they just issue the money for the claims, but the bank is the serverso to speak-that handles the flow of the money. They said the bank had the payment for XX/XX/2021, and that they took it back out when they closed my account. XXXX further said that Bank of America did this to them 8 months ago too, when they closed thousands of accounts for non-specific reasons. It took some people over half of a year to resolve it. During this time, there were accounts of many people committing XXXX and becoming homeless because of the banks actions, and dying from illnesses, i.e., Covid, etc, because they couldnt afford hospitalization. The proper lack of communication between the bank and XXXX left many people in very unfortunate ways. Is anyone considering this? So not only did Covid kill Americans, but so did our system. XXXX also added that I needed to contact the bank to open my account. I went to the bank again, and they blamed it on XXXX, again. I called XXXX back. They blamed it on the bank, and so on and so forth. 
Finally XXXX put a XXXX hold on my account pending resolution. When I saw this appear on my account 3 weeks ago, I called XXXX again. They said they put that hold on my account because the bank had requested it. They gave me a link to submit my ID and social security card, and I did. They also told me to continue filing my weekly claims which I have done. I filed for XX/XX/2021 ; XX/XX/2021 ; and ( by the time you receive this ) XX/XX/2021. In summary, they owe me 4 payments of which one of them is in never-never land, who knows where. The later payments are not showing up as paid on my account. My remaining XXXX balance available to me is currently {$11000.00}. 
Then on XX/XX/2021, I received a letter from Bank of America that said my account was now in FROZEN status. I called the bank and a rep told me that was different then CLOSED. However, when I call on the card, it still says closed. 
Now to make matters even worse, XXXX is rolling out a new card called XXXX XXXX XXXX which I havent even received and its doubtful I will, considering the status of my account. It will take the place of the Bank of America debit card on XX/XX/2021. I heard this information on the local news channel. 
Ive called XXXX ( XXXX unit ) at least 2 dozen times to resolve this matter. I get the same answers each time. They blame the hold on Bank of America, and tell me to WAIT. Some reps say it could take months to resolve, if not longer. This is unacceptable. 
Ive written to you today to ask for help. I am desperate. I am XXXX. This is going to destroy my life. So I made it through Covid, and now Bank of America and XXXX are going to be my demise? Are you kidding me? 
My cell number is XXXX, and my name is XXXX. Can you help me please? I dont know what to do next since neither agency can fix it. This is just an example of government red tape where the right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing. Does it make you think that there is some funny business going on, i.e., missing money, etc, on the banks part? I think someone is either stealing it, or making interest off of mine and many other peoples money that is being withheld. Moreover, I got furloughed at the same time as some other guys from my union hall and the same company. Their accounts are also CLOSED, on exactly the same date as mine. Dont you find this odd? 
Thank you very much for your time.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I schedule all of my payments online and print payment receipts when payments are scheduled. I always schedule the payment for the end of the month before the payment is due. I scheduled a payment for the total amount due on XX/XX/2019 of {$1400.00}. Then for the XXXX Total balance of {$1000.00} I scheduled the payment on XX/XX/2019. I have the transaction receipts for both of these payments. Then on XX/XX/2019, Bank of America took out an additional payment in {$1400.00} out of my checking account without my authorization. When I saw the error, I contacted Bank of American on XX/XX/2019. They could not explain to me how this could happen and told me they would initiate a refund back to my checking account for the {$1400.00}. In the meantime, I have to move money around, borrow cash from my employer just to make sure I had enough in checking to cover my withdrawals. I called them back on XX/XX/2019 when the money still had not been returned to my checking account. They still could give me no reason as to how this happened and only gave me the answer of, "" it takes up to 5 business days to process the refund ''. On Monday, XX/XX/2019 when the money was STILL not in my checking account, I called Bank of America again, only to be told by 2 more people that they could not explain what happened and that I should have the money back by the following day. As of right now, I am still trying to make sure my impending withdrawals are covered and I am still waiting for my money to be returned to my account. The fact that Bank of America STILL can not tell me how they were able to access over {$1400.00} from my checking account without my consent is baffling.

Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/2020 I requested to set up recurring payments on account ending XXXX. Bank of America cancelled my payments on all of the credit cards that I have with them because a {$2.00} payment that was refund on a different credit card. They have no right to cancel my automated payments and not sent a notification by mail that they were going to do that. Customer services never explained to me on any of my conversations with them on XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 that they have a policy that if you have a payment return on any credit card they would cancel your online payment accessibility on all of the bank America accounts which I find this arbitrary because they should not be mixing payments with the different credit cards. Each account should be handle separate. Today they said that since is not a bank error they would not refund the {$39.00} late fee charge on XX/XX/2020. Even though they cause the fee because they cancel my recurrent payment without notifying me. Please assist me with this matter. thank you

The card in question was originally card # XXXX  and after it was cancelled and reissued it is now card xxxx I noticed XXXX  fraudulent charges to my credit card beginning on XX/XX/XXXX and ending on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the fraud department at Bank of America to explain about the fraudulent charges. On that day I spoke to XXXX in your office. She cancelled the card and reissued a new card. Also, case # XXXX was assigned. On XX/XX/XXXX a letter was sent to me from Bank of America stating that Were unable to approve your recent Fraud claim. Based on your account history this charge is consistent with this merchant. This is a false summary of my account history with this card. I have been a card holder with Bank of America since XXXX. This card is used by me for purchasing permits and to pay for recycling in my business. In researching my past purchases charges at XXXX have appeared on this card. Most charges are less than {$20.00} and no more than {$500.00}.

"" While you personally didn't make the charges, we confirmed it was made by an authorized user on the account or someone who has permission to use the card ''. Nothing could be further from the truth. The signed receipts I obtained from XXXX has a signature of a person or persons I do not know or have no relationship with personally or professionally. I have been forced to retain legal counsel which I expect Bank of America to reimburse me for after the fraud department determines finally that these charges are fraudulent. I am including all documents I have obtain doing my own research in to this matter. I ask Bank of America for a speedy resolution and to have these fraudulent charges removed from my account.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Financial Institution : Bank of America TravelCard Balance Transfer 1 ( XX/XX/XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I wanted to take advantage of BoA 's promotional balance transfer of 0 % interest payment until XX/XX/XXXX. I transferred over from 3 credit cards with the total amount of {$9100.00} to this balance transfer promotion. I set up my BoA to autopay from my checking account to pay $ XXXX. I made 3 payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. But on XX/XX/XXXX, BoA automatically paid off the remaining balance of {$7200.00} directly from my checking account. I also had the auto-pay make the {$640.00} payment in XXXX. When my checking account was low, I received a noticed from BoA that my checking was below the minimum balance. I contacted BoA and told them I didn't authorize this payment how come my balance transfer is paid off? They explained to me that I had a setting for auto-pay to pay off remaining balance if my checking account had enough funds. I asked well how am I going to pay off my mortgage or other bills if you took the funds from my checking account? I asked if I can have this reversed, credit the amount back to my checking account. They said yes, it will take a few days. I asked if I get this credited back, will I still have the promotional 0 % interest rate until XX/XX/XXXX? They said NO. Because I can't utilize the promotion, and my balance has been paid off, I asked not to transfer my credit back to my checking. As a result I had to tap in to my savings account to pay my other bills. 

Balance Transfer 2 ( XX/XX/XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to advantage of another BoA TravelCard balance transfer promotion for 0 % interest until XX/XX/XXXX. I transferred a total of {$8000.00}. And this time I will set up the autopay to pay $ XXXX from my checking account. I also cleared the settings to auto-payoff the entire balance from my checking account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made the first payment {$700.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX BoA applied a Payment Adjustment by taking the balance that I paid off from my 1st Balance Transfer ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and crediting it to my checking account in the amount of {$6500.00}. With that I TravelCard account has a total debt of {$14000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BoA and asked why do I have an additional debt of {$6500.00} added to my XXXX account totaling {$14000.00} in total debt? The representative said you requested to be credited. I told her, No I did not request it. I may have requested it initially, but I changed my mind because the debt is paid off ( Balance Transfer 1 ). I told them if I paid off the debt why would I want to re-borrow the debt? I did not request this. 

As the support person troubleshooted the issue, she said the newly added debt of {$6500.00} does not have the promotional balance offer and it will have a higher interest rate. And if you try to pay off {$6500.00}, it will go towards paying off your 2nd balance transfer. The lady generated a case # XXXX, and said maybe your newly added debt of {$6500.00} can also get the 0 % balance transfer, but her manager would have to reach out to me. I provided my number and never received a call."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Hi, I contacted and talked with an agent in the BOA using the mobile app to transfer my credit limit from my old credit card ending XXXX to the new one ending XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the agent to transfer the {$900.00} credit limit from my old credit card to the new one which ends up changing the credit limit of my old credit card from {$1400.00} to {$500.00} and the new one from {$13000.00} to $ XXXXThe agent initially gave me false information and told me that she can not do that as it is impossible to move the credit limit between the credit cards. Since I have done it before multiple times and I knew that it is possible to do this transfer, I asked her again to check if she could do it fact that I was sure it is doable. After holding in the line for few minutes, the agent told me that she could do this and I need to wait for a few minutes to see the changes in my end. I immediately checked my mobile app and I got to know that the {$900.00} is deducted from my XXXX credit card but it was not added to my XX/XX/XXXXcredit card. I told her the situation and she said it may take some time to see the update on my end and she said that she can see the changes on her end. She told me that she can see my credit card limits changed to {$500.00} and {$14000.00} as it was supposed to be changed and she disconnected the call while I was talking. I called after a few minutes that I found that the credit limit in my XX/XX/XXXXaccount did not change to {$14000.00}, and I was told that the first agent just reduced my credit limit in my XXXX account and did not initiate the credit limit transfer but just the credit limit reduce and she did a mistake. The new agent apologized and connected me to her supervisor but both of them tried to request a credit line increase to fix this situation which did not let them fix it. I was told there is another way to fix this error which occurred due to the BOA agent earlier. This credit limit reduction has significant impact to my credit history and needs to be fixed immediately."

One BofA agent had me drive to a branch to ask for my money a day before XXXX. BofA Agents took me for a fool. I even filed complaints if they allowed me but im not sure if they did file the complaints
Credit card or prepaid card,I called bank of america edd customer service about gettjng emergency cash before i recievwd my card and they told me twice they didnt offer those services anymlre. But i emailed them and got an email bacj saying XXXX did. So i called back and tild them and ghey done everyghing they coyld not to help me. Please contact them.
Credit card or prepaid card,I have reward credit card from Bank of America where I pay {$20.00} a month. I was going through financial hardship but I'm in a better situation now and I was able to pay the entire balance.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was charged {$75.00} by XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX IL for a credit/background check for an apartment lease. My application was denied even though I know I passed the credit check and background check. The law states that if I am denied an apartment lease due to background check I must be told why so that I can correct the problem. XXXX refused to tell me why. I have a suspicion that the denial was because I was using a housing voucher. I have hired an attorney. In any case, the {$75.00} should be refunded to me because my application was denied and the company refused to let me fix the problem. 
I explained all of this to Bank of America when I called to dispute the charge. I was sent a letter telling me to provide documentation. There is no documentation, everything was done by phone or via XXXX application link. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to provide a written statement to BofA electronically. They are insisting on a paper copy being sent to them in the mail. I have difficulty writing. I can type, but I don't have a printer. I am XXXX and it's a real hardship for me to get to a place where I can get something printed. BofA is not willing to provide a solution for me. I have never heard of anything so antiquated. They have told me that because I can not send them a paper copy of my complaint I will have to pay the {$75.00}. One of the reasons I use credit cards is for the consumer protections. I had a dispute with XXXX a few months ago. They handled everything over the telephone. This makes me thing that BofA does not want to settle any disputes. They make it very difficult for the consumer to file the complaint."
Credit card or prepaid card,In XXXX of XXXX I filed a dispute for several charges on my XXXX debit card and was auto denied due to the Auto dispute resolution data and was reconsidered in XXXX of XXXX. I sent police report and have yet to receive any updates from the bank
Credit card or prepaid card,"Verbally advised they were in violation for the XXXX XXXX Act. Every single BANK I SPEAK WITH AND QUOTE THIS LAW TOO. DOES NOT CONFORM. I have been hung up on, told they do not have ID NUMBERS AND REFUSE TO COMPLY. They will not honor that I have a federal right to speak to anyone in that company per federal law. And will not comply. The will follow FCRA LAW. Lengthy hold times, inaccurate information and numerous transfer because they abuse a XXXX American that worked there and has verified they still study laws every year. This is pure and utter RETAILIATION. Which is also against the law. Or do you enforce anything? Thank you for holding this bank accountable for their lies and manipulation from someone who worked there and verified Inahve been lied to on multiple calls on XX/XX/2022. I have an open fraud case also. Went to the branch office, as the frauXXXX department would not answer the phone aft a long wait. They refused to help even though I have a fraud charge and abuse of elderly. The looked at me like I have the PLAGUE WHEN I quoted them the law they study every year. I am totally disgusted with AMERICA. You sit there and make hug salaries. And state this and that and call yourselves honorable. Actions speak louder than words. Is there any action left or only WORDS THAT ACCOMPLISH NOTHING. Please do some freaking due diligence and see the hypocrisy. Do it, dont play patty cake and ask them. INVESTIGATE AND PROSCUTE. Or there is no law. Only what you do and dont get caught. Thank you."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/19, I went into a Bank of America branch to make a {$300.00} cash payment on my credit card at the teller window. I was intercepted by a banker who made me do the transaction at an ATM, even though I was not comfortable depositing cash there. With the banker as a witness to the entire transaction, the ATM ate my money and spit out a receipt that said the request couldn't be processed and my items could not be returned to me. The banker escorted me to a phone, where she placed a call to the claims department and filed a claim on my behalf. At that time, I was told the bank had up to 10 days to resolve the claim. The bank then kept extending their deadline for resolution. It appears that any time someone checked the status of the claim, they closed the claim and restarted the clock on it as a new claim. After multiple visits to the branch, there was no resolution, so I tweeted at the bank on XX/XX/19. One of the bank 's social media reps called me to follow up, and I shared the entire story with her. She said she'd look into and get back to me. When she called me on XX/XX/19, she reported that the bank had investigated and my claim was being denied. She said the investigation found no overage of cash in the ATM that day, and then she claimed that the bank had security footage of me getting the money back and that the bank employee who'd helped me file the claim said I'd received the money. It is impossible for this security footage to exist, because I NEVER got the money back. I asked to see the security footage, and the woman told me that she could not provide it."
Credit card or prepaid card,EDD had to verify my identity back in XX/XX/2020. They advised Bank of America to freeze my account until I verify. Ive verified my identity with them on XX/XX/2020. My account is still frozen with $ XXXX still on the card almost one year later. I keep getting the run around with both companies.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX I walked into the Bank of America Branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ. 

I indicated to the teller that I wanted to take the remaining balance from the account ( around {$1200.00} at the time ) and take it as cash or transfer to my bank account at another bank. 

The teller first indicated that the card was "" just a card and not an account '' and as such she pointed me to the ATM complete my transaction. Due to daily ATM transaction limits and uncertainty of the safety of carrying around a large amount of {$20.00} bills from the ATM, I said I wanted to complete the transaction in the Bank. The teller went on to say that she did not think such a large amount should be paid out to "" someone who is not a customer '' even after I provided my State ID as proof of my identification and would not complete the transaction. She then said there was an issue with the network that would allow the transaction. I do not believe there was a network issue. I believe this teller was unwilling to complete my transaction. Further, I demanded to speak to a supervisor who turns out was even more uncaring and told me to go to the ATM if the teller told him to."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2023 I filed a dispute with Bank of America regarding a return made to XXXX that was seemingly lost by XXXX, XXXX would not refund me nor would they agree to open a XXXX Investigation ( only XXXX can initiate the XXXX Investigation because they are the ones that purchased the pre-paid shipping label ). When filing dispute I explained the situation thoroughly, that I had returned the item in unused condition via XXXX with the label provided to me and my concerns about XXXX possibly losing it as the tracking was all over the place but ultimately delivered in Texas and signed for by someone. So I feel XXXX should take responsibility since they would not even contact XXXX for me. 
As for as Bank of America, they said that was all they needed from me ( just my statement and the return tracking number ). I wanted to include my XXXX drop off receipt, a copy of the return label given to me by XXXX, the shipment facts ( proving I sent the item back based on weight ), my XXXX XXXX XXXX complaint, and my communication with XXXX throughout the ordeal ( including me asking them to at least open an investigation with XXXX ). However, Bank of America did not provide me anywhere to submit this supporting documentation. On my messages in my Bank of America Portal, they said they would request more information if needed after the merchant responds to the claim. So I waited for them to request the documentation. But on XX/XX/2023 they denied the claim saying the merchant provided documentation showing the transaction is valid. 
The documentation they provided was shipping discrepancies and that i did not follow the terms and conditions policies for the transaction, the Terms and Conditions they highlighted to say i didnt follow were as followed : IV. Seal the delivery package and affix the pre-paid delivery label to it V. Bring the package to ANY XXXX location to arrange pick-up I followed both of these Terms and Conditions ( as well as all others ) but Bank of America did not even bother to ask me for the drop off receipt, the copy of the label I used provided by Cartier, or explanation as to why the return was shipped from XXXX Florida when I live in Washington State . I feel as if I had been given the opportunity to provide this critical documentation then my Bank of America dispute would have been resolved in my favor. 

When I reached out to Bank of America on XX/XX/2023 via phone to ask to appeal the decision, the representative asked me why I did not provide any documentation or proof with my claim. I explained to her that I was never told nor given a place to submit the documentation. She advised me that I should fax the documentation to the Bank of America claims department and provided the fax number. The other option was sending the documentation through postal mail. I asked if I would receive any confirmation that my claim is being appealed and she said that I wouldn't and that it will automatically appeal once I send over the documents. I faxed them a 14 page document after the phone call, explaining the situation and providing documentation. 

But this feels very odd to me and I am not comfortable with not receiving any type of confirmation. I feel as though in these modern times, Bank of America should be more transparent with clients about where and when they can submit PDF/Photo documentation to support their disputes. They should also have a system in place to notify clients that their fax submissions have been received and when they are being reviewed as well as confirmation of appeals being submitted. I feel very stressed now because I was not given the opportunity to submit proper documentation and now I don't even know if my fax is received or if my appeal is submitted. This lack of transparency from Bank of America does not feel right. 

The following is part of the explanation/documentation I faxed to Bank of America XXXX Bank of America did not request all of the documentation from me so I had previously only provided the return tracking number. I am now faxing documentation such as the copy of the XXXX Return Label provided to me by the merchant, the XXXX drop off receipt, a copy of the Shipment Facts per the XXXX tracking, my communication with XXXX regarding the return, as well as the Better Business Bureau complaint that was filed. 

My claim was denied because merchant provided documentation showing the transaction is valid. The documentation they provided was shipping discrepancies and that i did not follow the terms and conditions policies for the transaction, the Terms and Conditions they highlighted to say i didnt follow were as followed : IV. Seal the delivery package and affix the pre-paid delivery label to it V. Bring the package to ANY XXXX location to arrange pick-up As for shipping the package out from XXXX, this is because I asked my husband to return it in the XXXX Boutique in XXXX since he was there on a business trip ( there is no Cartier boutique in our state ). However the sales associate advised that he could only return online since the ring was not purchased via the XXXX XXXX so he proceeded with bringing it to the XXXX store and shipping it there with the return label that XXXX provided me ( copy attached ) ( meaning I followed the XXXX & XXXX of sealing the delivery package and affixing the pre-paid delivery label to it ). I am also providing the drop off receipt for this. Shipping the return from XXXX is not a violation of the XXXX & XXXX because it says "" Bring the package to ANY XXXX  location ''. In their terms and conditions, XXXX mentions the following : As the case may be, the Customer or Gift Recipient must keep proof of return shipment and the XXXX tracking number, and XXXX accepts no liability in the event such proof can not be produced. 
But neither XXXX nor Bank of America requested the return receipt from me nor gave me an opportunity to provide it. 
As for the shipping descrepancies, I am not sure why the package tracking goes back and forth between Tennessee, Florida, and Texas. I just know I did my part in the return correctly, and it should not be my fault if XXXX mishandles or misdelivers the package. I even asked XXXX multiple times if they could open a XXXX investigation and they refused. I tried calling XXXX to open the investigation but they said only XXXX can open the investigation because the return label was purchased by them. The tracking says it was delivered in XXXX XXXX, Texas and was signed for by "" XXXX '' who they claim is not an employee of theirs. Ultimately I think this whole issue could have been resolved had XXXX just agreed to open a XXXX Investigation but for some reason they refused. I also saw on their XXXX XXXX XXXX  claims that I am not the only person experiencing issues with returns with XXXX, there are many people having issues with their returns system. 
I would like my claim to be approved because I did follow the Terms & Conditions and returned the item back to XXXX and I can't even have XXXX investigate if it was an error on XXXX 's end because I did not purchase the return label. I did not provide this information previously because no one had requested me to send it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am having a nightmare trying to resolve fraudulent charges on my Bank of America credit card account. I have maintained this account for over 40 years, but in the past XXXX months have been receiving multiple charges from a company called XXXX ' - which my wife and I have never done any business with! When I first contacted B of A on XX/XX/2022 they promised to credit me back for the fraudulent charges, and promptly sent me out a new card with a new account number. Within 60 days, we received additional charges from 'XXXX  ' in the amount of {$1000.00}. on the new account! When I called to again contest fraudulent charges, I was told that 'XXXX  ' had the ability to continue charging me, even with new cards/account numbers. At this point, my wife and I had had enough, and asked B of A to promptly close our C.C. account and reverse again the fraudulent charges. I specifically withdrew permission for B of A to automatically pay down outstanding balances from my checking account, opting instead for a final paper bill that we could examine for any legitimate balance due. We were specifically assured that this change was made. 
Despite these instructions, on XX/XX/2022, we awoke to find out that B of A had withdrawn, without permission {$2100.00} from our personal checking account, again for XXXX ' charges that had previously been disputed. This unexpected cash grab caused us to be overdrawn on our checking account, causing even more pain and suffering. When I called B of A on the afternoon of XXXX XXXX to once again resolve the matter, I was on hold for XXXX minutes before a very sympathetic customer representative assured me that she would reverse the charge, only to be disconnected before any changes could be made. Despite my phone number being in the record, no call back was received."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2022, I received a {$8000.00} credit to my Bank of America Cash Rewards general purpose credit card account due to a returned purchase. 

I immediately contacted BofA customer service and requested that they refund the credit balance to my BofA checking account so that I could use the {$8000.00} for other expenses. 

They promised me that I would receive my refund in 7-14 business days. 

However, as of XX/XX/2022, 48 days later, I have still not received my credit balance refund. 

I have contacted them 3 times about the same matter. 

I believe that BofA has been highly delinquent in addressing this credit balance refund request and must be held accountable for not returning money to a customer in a timely manner. This is a substantial amount of money and not returning it quickly could cause financial harm."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX charged on XXXX card and XXXX cards fraudcharges of XXXX and XXXX. Bank of America someone got my XXXX XXXXXXXX card and charged {$3900.00}. 

Both banks are not dismissing the charges. I filed a police report and sent it to the banks. I never made these charges. The banks refuse to dismiss the charges that I never made."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Last XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a program that was financed on multiple credit cards to purchase a revenue and education system from a company called XXXX. 

My purchase with Bank of America and had an initial purchase of {$20000.00} placed on it to buy into XXXX and start my education. In XX/XX/XXXX, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) shut the company down for multiple reasons. The XXXX website, as well as it's subsidiaries, were also shut down. Many people were left with no contact, a lot of debt and no income to pay those bills. 

I have not received what I was promised - an education, training, income. 

Many of the companies I used as a line of credit to complete the purchase have provided in full charge backs. The companies I have received full refunds are XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

But back to Bank of America - they gave a provisional credit and then retracted it. I would appreciate it if they would create a charge back of {$20000.00}, which is the XXXX down payment."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have had a visa credit card account with Bank of America for 18 years. On XX/XX/2018 for the first time ever, I noticed fraudulent charges on the account for a total of {$330.00} by two companies XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX. I reported this to Bank of America, my credit card number was closed out and a new number issued. The fraud claim was investigated by Bank of America and the charges were credited back to me. On XX/XX/2018 I noticed new fraudulent charges from XXXX  again for {$100.00} ( note that I have never used this vendor for any services ) and after calling Bank of America I was told that the reason I am charged again is b/c both Bank of America and XXXX participate in a program offered by Visa  called "" VISA XXXX XXXX '' where the bank automatically transmits new credit card numbers to Visa and Visa transmits it to vendor ( in this case XXXX ) to avoid disruption in subscription/service if a customer 's credit card info on-file changes. So instead of a customer directly calling a vendor to update his/her credit card info, Bank of America automatically does this service, WITHOUT giving the customer an option to opt-out of this service. In my case, the unfortunate situation is that someone fraudulently used my credit card information to open 6 separate accounts with XXXX and even though I closed that card number, Bank of America keeps transmitting my new number to Visa  and Visa to XXXX. Many financial institutions ( XXXX XXXX and credit unions for example ) do offer customers an aption to "" opt out '' of "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' but Bank of America refuses to offer this option. This practice is not fair to consumers and in cases of fraud, like my situation, can result in fraudulent subscription accounts getting funded indefinitely unless the victim of fraud is forced to close his/her account with their credit card account holder. Bank of America also refused to block this particular vendor so future charges no longer appear simply b/c I did not authorize the charges to begin with since they are fraud charges."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My Bank Of America credit card ending in XXXX had a fraudulent charge of {$110.00} at a XXXX has Station over 45 days ago. Bank of America has denied my claim citing that it was because the charge occurred in my "" geographic region ''. 

Bank of America sent me a new credit card for XXXX before the fraud charge occurred because of merchant I used the card at Unfortunately I did not get a chance to activate the new card until after the fraudulent charge. 

I have spent 6 hours in total on the phone with the bank 's fraud department. They have now reopened my claim and keep giving me the run around. They will not even credit me the {$110.00} to my account while they investigate. 

I have submitted proof to the bank that I was in Key West, FL on the date of the fraudulent charge because I was using another Bank Of America credit card ending in XXXX. 

I have spoke with numerous supervisors including XXXX most recently. This is deeply disappointing because I have significant assets with the bank and have been a loyal customer for over 15 years."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America has a credit card bill/balance pay feature that overcharges my personal checking account leaving me with an enormous account credit. I then must call Bank of America, request the account credit that they erroneously charged me ( Most recently, {$1000.00} ). They then mail me a check for the amount in 7-10 business days. Between my account and my wife 's account, this has happened at least three times. 

This practice puts me at risk for overdraft in my personal bank account from which I draft these payments. Additionally, it seems absurd that Bank of America can not match the payment billed to the amount ACTUALLY OWED ON THE ACCOUNT. 

Furthermore, when I call Bank of America, the automated system offers the option to request my account credit as the VERY FIRST OPTION. This shows that Bank of America knows about this problem and has yet to do anything to fix it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"There was a withdrawal of {$1000.00} from my Bank of America PrePaid card that I myself did not make in XXXX XXXX. I called to make a claim regarding that XXXX XXXX and they told that they would look into it, XXXX XXXX I received a letter stating that my claim was closed. I called again to have the claim reopened since I did not make that withdrawal. They have asked me to send in a photo of my ID to compare to security cameras where the withdraw was made, as well as call back every week to check in. As of today XX/XX/XXXX I still have not received my credit. I have done everything they asked me and they keep giving me different stories everytime I call."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Notified by Bank of America of fraud on my credit card via voice-mail and when I logged into my account on XXXX XX/XX/2022.

I called them on XXXX XX/XX/2022 and verified that the transaction for XXXX dollars on XXXX XX/XX/2022 I did not authorize and this was listed on my account as an ACH Payment Refund. I called Bank of America again and they told me to go into one of their offices. I went into Bank of America offices on XXXX XX/XX/2022 so the could verify my identity and talk to fraud personnel for the third time. They said the investigation would take up to 60 days. During my second call they said they would send me a cashiers Check. I have received different information each time I have called the fraud department about the circumstances of what happened and the resolution, very confusing/misleading."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America is applying my monthly payment to my 0 % transfer balances first and then applying whatever is leftover above the minimum due, to my 15 % purchase balance.   This seems in direct violation of th e 2009 c redit card act? Where payments must be applied to the highest interest balances first?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Every month for the last few months, when I pay the balance of my credit card, Bank Of America adds a "" Pending Transaction '' for the Amount that I have paid that falls off after XXXX  days thus locking out my ability to use my credit card. This time, I am on a work trip in FL and need a credit card for Expenses and I can't use my card. 

This is not my only issue. It is a Secured card, I provided bank of America XXXX to secure the XXXX credit Limit when I moved to the US in XXXX 2016. Yes I have now had the card for over XXXX  years and It is STILL Secured. My credit fluctuates as I have been going through a divorce, however I have not missed a payment in the last XXXX years and usually pay the balance off near the end of the month."
Credit card or prepaid card,"BANK OF AMERICA : On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, somebody made XXXX charges on my credit card, each for {$350.00}. The charges were for concert tickets in XXXX. I was not in XXXX. I have not been to XXXX  since then. The only time I had ever been to XXXX  in my life was XXXX  months before this incident. 

I filed a fraud claim that same day, and they replaced my credit card, but did not credit me for these charges. I waited, and they still never credited me. This should be an automated system that doesn't require my involvement. I kept waiting, and for XXXX  months dreaded having to deal with the problem, so I didn't call again. Finally this week I decided to fix the issue, despite how annoying and depressing it was going to be to deal with. 

After XXXX hours on the phone, I was told the problem would be resolved within XXXX  days. This didn't happen. They finally issued the credit at XXXX XXXX  only to close the claim RULING AGAINST ME at XXXX XXXX, taking the credit back from me. After letting my OBVIOUS fraud claim lie untouched for XXXX  months, they decided to rule against me in the middle of the night without asking me for any documentation or anything. I made purchases in my home state ( NOT XXXX  ) repeatedly around the dates of this supposed transaction, and never went to XXXX, or moved my residence, or anything like that in the last XXXX  months."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XXXX /2017, a purchase was made at XXXX in NYC on a new credit card which I have never received for the amount of XXXX. After numerous calls to the Bank of America, letters, Police report, and proof I was at work in New Jersey on that day and send by certified mail to the fraud division in Texas. I asked for proof of signature and how the card was activated without my knowledge and proof security ( my home phone number ) I called the customer services/fraud division. Every time I got a different story."
Credit card or prepaid card,"For many years I have paid my Bank of America credit card balance in full through autopay from a checking account at another bank. This always worked without fail. 



In XXXX I took advantage of a 0 % APR Balance Transfer offer on my Bank of America credit card in the amount of {$10000.00}. A 3 % fee, totaling {$300.00}, was applied to my account at that time as well. Due to this balance transfer, I wanted to change my autopay from being the full statement balance to only the minimum payment due in order to take advantage of the 0 % APR promotional period. I was unable to do this on the website due to an error that indicated my account was not eligible for "" Bill Pay '' despite the fact that I was trying to make a payment with my credit card, which is a different service. I also tried changing the automatic payment on my mobile app, but there I would get the message that "" Your request can't be processed due to account status. '' I waited a few days to see if this status would change. 



On XX/XX/2023 there was still no change, so I made my first call to Bank of America. This conversation lasted 16 minutes. I don't remember all the details, and I didn't take notes, but I think that it was something along the lines of agreeing that I should wait to see whether the new balance transfer had temporarily affected the account status and that the issue may resolve itself. The issue did not resolve itself. 



I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a representative for 11 minutes. This resulted in the customer service representative stating that they had requested my autopay to be reset, resulting in my automatic payments being cancelled, and that I should be able to access the online system within 24 to 48 hours and set up my new autopay parameters. This did not work. 



I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to someone for 13 minutes. After spending some time investigating the cause of the issue, they asked to access my browser with me in order to see the error messages I was getting. I declined because I was using my work computer, and I told them I would call back another day. 



I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to someone for 54 minutes. They assured me that the problem the first time was that I had failed to accept the Terms and Conditions of the autopay system, which should have popped up the next time I logged in. I did not recall seeing a popup, but I consented to having them reset the system again and trying again in a few days. They added that it appeared my original autopay for the full statement balance had still been in effect when they reset it this time, but that they had now successfully removed that autopay and reset everything. I took extra care to look for the popup over the next couple of days, but it never appeared. 



I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to someone for 58 minutes. This conversation ended up being extremely similar to my conversation on XX/XX/XXXX. I reiterated that it would be a disaster for me if my upcoming autopay occurred. I specifically asked the customer service representative whether my autopay was active, and she told me it was active but that I had no upcoming automatic payments since my next bill would be due in XXXX. She insisted that resetting the account would finally work, so I agreed that I would consent again to resetting autopay, even though I was skeptical. 



On XX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I got an email from the bank where I have my checking account stating that my checking account had been overdrawn. The autopay that I specifically requested Bank of America NOT to make had been made in the amount of {$10000.00}, which put my checking account at the other bank at a negative balance of - {$6100.00}. 



A few minutes after seeing the email I called Bank of America and spoke to someone for 16 minutes. This customer service representative offered to refund the payment, but that it would take 10 days to process. I can not live with a negative balance in my checking account for 10 days, so I refused and called XXXX XXXX, the bank that holds my checking account. 



A few minutes after I hung up with Bank of America, I called XXXX XXXX and spoke to someone for 11 minutes who was able to dispute the transaction and put a stop payment for future payments. The customer service representative said they couldn't assure me of whether the funds would be usable as it would take up to 10 days to dispute the transaction. 



I called Bank of America again and spoke to someone for 56 minutes. They insisted it was impossible to get my money back in fewer than 10 days, which I insisted was not good enough and that I would not be satisfied with that outcome. After several rounds of me asking what else could be done and being denied any other options, I consented to the refund request. I asked if I would be compensated for the loss of use of my checking account for 10 days and I was informed that they would not be compensating me. I mentioned that I STILL could not access autopay or make any changes on the website or mobile app, and the customer service representative followed the same steps as before and assured me that actually this time would be different because the person she asked to do the change for me is especially competent and it would work in 24 to 48 hours. I am skeptical of that actually being true.

I also asked whether my promotional APR would still apply once the refund was processed. I was assured that yes, my 0 % APR would still apply once the refund is processed. I hope that's true because it would be the first thing that Bank of America has told me in the last month that wasn't a lie. 



In Summary : I called Bank of America 5 times in order to fix autopay. The last 2 of those times I specified that an upcoming statement balance autopay should NOT be made, and I was assured it was cancelled. Bank of America made the autopay of {$10000.00} without my consent, and my checking account is now overdrawn. Bank of America told me it would be 10 days until the refund would be processed. I was given no compensation, and I will have to live with a negative checking account balance for 10 days."

I never requested for the refund ; I did not see where the refund went either. <P/>( 2 ) XXXX The customer service gave me wrong information about my autopay setup and it prevents me from calculating and meeting the spending request of the welcome offer. I was confirmed a few times by the customer service that I had set up autopay successfully. However, I have been charged late fee and interests multiple times after that. Though they agreed to waive those fees, the inconsistency confused me with the calculation of my spending amount in the given period specified by the welcome offer. I calculated using the payment amount with the assumption that the payment amount should equal to the spending amount ( as the customer representative told me that autopay 's been set up correctly. However, there is discrepancy between them for either the wrong info provided by the customer service or issues with BofA autopay system and hence the spending amount was calculated wrongly ( I missed by ~ {$20.00} ). After finding out this issue, I immediately filled up the difference by spending another {$40.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and tried to contacted BofA. I received a voicemail from BofA during the winter break when I went to another country.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America closed two of my credit card accounts. The first card they closed was opened over 20 years ago and was used and paid in a timely manner. The second card they closed was opened on or about XX/XX/XXXX and was used and paid in a timely manner as well. 

To my knowledge, I did not receive a letter indicating their intent to close these credit card accounts nor the reason for closing these accounts. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America to discuss why they closed my accounts. The only information they gave me was that they sent a letter, which I did not receive, and that I had too many open credit card accounts and that my credit score is too low. 

This is unfair because these accounts have been paid at least the minimum amount due monthly by their due date. Most months, I have made extra payments to these cards in order to lower the balance and improve my credit score."

Letter was sent on XX/XX/XXXX regarding claim XXXX stating BofA issued a temporary credit to my account that would post within the the next XXXX business days. 

Letter was sent on XX/XX/XXXX regarding claim XXXX stating my claim has been closed because the bank believes my account or the claim have been the subject of fraud or suspicious activity and any temporary credit applied to my account would be debited from my account. 

A letter on XX/XX/XXXX regarding claim XXXX stating that BofA has completed their investigation of the disputed transaction. The previously issued credit of {$980.00} is now permanent. 

Other Issues that prevented the claims from being approved : Bank of America ran internal audits which automatically closed claims. 

Bank of America created new claims instead of reopening existing claims which raised red flags.

Credit card or prepaid card,"While I have enjoyed a great relationship with Bank of America ( and it goes back to XXXX Nations Bank ) and having the majority of all finances with them since approximately XXXX I have recently had some problematic issues with the credit card - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Unfortunately Bank of America closed this card at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and now I am astonished that Bank of America is reporting me as late multiple times on my credit for this account. 

I did first notice that my auto payment in XXXX was returned and this was the first occurrence since the account opened in XXXX. This was confusing as I was under the impression from when this account was set up as I filled out paperwork and provided a wet signature for the monthly minimum payment to be pulled via ach. At this time ( XXXX ) Bank of America informed that this auto payment would be pulled via ach and thus the automatic payment would be attempted up to three times. I discovered after this XX/XX/XXXX auto payment was returned that this is NOT the case and this payment was attempted only once. 

This situation occurred again in XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and I immediately posted a payment to this account and requested that the statement date be set up for later in the month ( sometime XXXX or after ). Since the staff member took my payment over the phone she offered me dates and I choose toward the end of each month. I remember choosing around the XXXX of the each month as my new statement date. It is extremely important that this payment is not attempted on XXXX of each month. I was told that this statement date change may not occur during XXXX but should occur starting in XXXX. XXXX payment went through fine. 

Unfortunately this change in statement date never occurred and this bank is still attempting this auto payment on XXXX of each month. ( This statement date change still needs to take place ). 

I have spent significant time during XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and now XXXX on getting manual payments over, changing the statement date, attempting to get the card open again and now this/these 30 day late marks. 

For all reasons above and since I set up this statement date change in early XXXX ( and immediately made a payment at this time ) my goal and need is to have this/these 30 day late marks removed. i have put forth significant effort on this matter, originally set up the ach minimum payment to prevent this situation ( it was supposed to attempt up to 3 times ), requested ( and thought I received ) a statement date for a later day each month during XXXX, and have made all payments to bring this account current. 

In addition to all of the above I am also a single father and this situation has caused and will continue to cause serious financial injury to me if it stays as is. 

I would greatly appreciate all of your assistance in this matter."

I have excellent credit but I can't make the huge payments I have been making, so i tried calling Bank of America to get the 0 % rate extended.

The automated system said I could defer three payments but the very high interest would still be charged when my 0 % fee ran out.

I this was brought to my attention with in 60 days and I called the Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX department and was told they would file a claim for this un authorized transaction and they would cancel my card ending in XXXX and mail me a new card. Bank of America indeed did cancel my card ending in XXXX and ordered me a new card ending in XXXX. I was told this was standard protocol and it made sense to me. I was also under the impression that the unauthorized transactions where all in dispute status and I patiently waited for this process. Sometime around late XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to the dispute department to get an update on those claims in particular the transaction of {$150.00} from XX/XX/XXXX. I was disappointed to be told that there was no claim filed for this dispute. The representative assured me they would file the claim at that moment and was apologetic because this should had been processed months ago when I contacted. The previous card was cancelled and a new one was ordered. Somehow, this original dispute was overlooked or perhaps ignored. The representative indeed did file the dispute over the phone for me and I received provisional credit on XX/XX/XXXX for {$150.00}. 
To my surprise, I was informed by Bank of America in a letter mailed to my home address that Bank of America will be reversing back {$150.00} from my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The reason they stated was because I had filed the dispute after the 60 day cut off after the transaction date. Bank of America did not give me the opportunity to explain that this should had been taken care of last XX/XX/XXXX. They where fully aware of this because they cancelled my previous card and ordered me a new card on XX/XX/XXXX. Instead they did not take a moment to make a informed decision. This was unprofessional and unethical."

Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/21 I noticed that there was a charge made to my card that I didnt do. When I looked into previous days I noticed that it was more than one. It was {$190.00} worth in purchases. I contacted the merchant to complain about which it was XXXX through email. The next day I contacted Bank of America to dispute my transactions. I waited about a month and then I received a letter saying that they already finished the investigation and found that it concordat with my usual usage. I call them to see how they came to that conclusion since XXXX emailed me back with the information of who have done these purchases. They reopened my case just to a couple of weeks later send me a letter saying that these purchases where made by an authorized user on my account which I do not have. Spend two almost two hours on the phone just so they can say we have to resubmit the dispute again. They did and a few weeks later the same thing a letter on the mail stating that it was an authorized user which like I said I do not have. I asked to speak to a manager and explained my problem and asked for the manager to explain how the investigation is done since is obviously they didnt do it since I was the one that emailed the merchant and had to pay {$6.00} extra to fax the paper over to them since I couldnt even email them. He said it was a mistake they did on the first dispute and that now he fixed it and it should be approved. A couple of week later the same letter came is now almost XXXX and my dispute still didnt get approved. A week ago I tried calling again was on the phone for almost two hours going from manager to manager and the last thing that manager told me was that in order for me to get my money back I had to do a police report and call back with the information so my dispute can be approved. Before hanging up I told her I recorded the information she just gave me and that she was sure that is how it was going to happen since I keep getting different things said to me from different people there she lied and said yes that she noted in my account everything we talked about and what she suggested. When I did the report I called back and they said there is no note and that I need it to fax or mail the police report which they only have me a lil card with the number and the police officer information. She said she going to reopen it and this time it should work. This manager expla To me how they do investigation and noticed that in my account the merchant was not contacted. They never investigated on my case apparently according to a lawyer it would have cost Bank of America more than {$200.00} to investigate my dispute and for them that would have not been worth it. I cant believe this bank. Is a shame they even open!

In XXXX I deleted him from the card and started divorce proceedings. I have been paying the card down since then as he has run it up substantially. I have not been charging on it lately. 

I save my mileage for trips, plane tickets and rely this as I am on a limited budget. BOA credit cards have always had a "" no expiration '' on mileage policy. They have never taken back mileage from me until now. I looked at my mileage on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed that my mileage was less than 50 % of what it should be. I called and spoke with their customer service rep and was advised that I have only been a member since XXXX, which is 100 % false. I was advised that each month they have been taking mileage from me once the mileage hit 5 years of age because they expire. So basically, every month in XXXX, BOA takes my earned mileage back when it hits XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told that I should have been notified of this each time. I HAVE NEVER BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THEY ARE TAKING MY EARNED MILEAGE BACK. I would have used the points! The representative claims that this is the type of credit card that I have. I have never had this type of credit card with BOA, whereas they take my earned mileage back. I googled BOA mileage expirations, and my research indicates that BOA mileage does not expire. I was told that my current non-usage of the card has nothing to do with them taking my mileage back. I really need my mileage back as I plan to take a trip soon."
Credit card or prepaid card,"To whom it may concern, Since XXXX of last year ( XXXX ) I call Bank of America ( BOA ) and filed a dispute on fraudulent charges on my XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) credit card. At the same time I was issued a new credit card, in which i never received a replacement card. After telling BOA that the card was never received, they went ahead and sent a 3rd credit card. I was told the dispute will be resolved in probably 3 days. Then my monthly bill came in with the same disputed charges plus late fees and interest charges. Thru months of communication dispute remains unsolved, and i refuse to pay minimum monthly payments at their request as i didn't have a previous balance on this credit card. So now it's beginning of XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a letter stating my claim all has been resolved and I don't have to do anything on my part and I will see the credit on my monthly statement. this is after i filed a police report due to other passed letters received stating all charges were legitimate. Now its XXXX I received my monthly statement stating I still owe all charges plus late & interest charges. My credit score is now compromised, unfortunately I still refuse to pay.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have recently been a victim of identity theft and financial fraud. Over the past two months I have been defrauded of {$19000.00} through my Bank of America EDD Debit Card account. I did not authorize any of the transactions in question. I was not involved, in any way, in any of the transactions in question. I have submitted multiple formal claims of fraud with BoA. I have supplied BoA with information and documents that verify the fraudulent nature of each of the transactions in question. Despite this, BoA has so far denied all of my claims, repeatedly. Prior to XX/XX/XXXX, BoA had made no attempt to explain the basis of their decisions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX, assistant to XXXX XXXX, Resolution Specialist with Bank of America 's Regulatory Complaints department. XXXX XXXX was calling to inform me that XXXX XXXX had completed her response to my complaints filed with the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. This conversation was the only contact I had received from XXXX XXXX, or her office, since receiving an introductory email from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In that XX/XX/XXXX email, XXXX XXXX said that she would need to speak with me directly by phone, by XX/XX/XXXX. I subsequently phoned XXXX XXXX 's office multiple times over the the following week, leaving a message, including my call back number, every time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received any response from XXXX XXXX, so I phoned BoA to inquire about the situation, noting that XXXX XXXX had stated in her XX/XX/XXXX email that she would be required to speak with me directly by phone, by XX/XX/XXXX. I subsequently spoke with two different BoA representatives regarding this. The first was not familiar with any of the details of the email, and initially suggests that the email may be fraudulent. They then conferred with a colleague, who seemed to have the same suspicions, but who similarly could not provide a definitive answer. I then spoke with a different BoA representative who also could not provide a definitive answer as to the validity of the email. Her only suggestion is to forward the email to XXXX. 

When XXXX XXXX first phoned me on XX/XX/XXXX, I was very suspicious of the call, given what I had been told by BoA representatives on XX/XX/XXXX. But, after accepting XXXX XXXX as being a legitimate BoA representative, I listened to what he had to say. I also accepted to receive XXXX XXXX XXXX response via email. 

I then asked to file a formal complaint regarding XXXX XXXX making herself entirely unavailable to me ever since sending me her XX/XX/XXXX email. XXXX XXXX advised me that I would need to speak with a Regulatory Complaints department supervisor in order to accomplish that, and that he was taking the step required for me to do so. XXXX XXXX told me that I would receive a phone call from a Regulatory Complaints department supervisor within the next 48 hours. 

I have never been contacted again by anybody from BoA Regulatory Complaints department. 

Additionally, since receiving XXXX XXXX 'XXXX  response via email ( case number XXXX ), I have further grievances. The response I received is entirely insufficient. Even qualifying it as a "" response '' is generous. In it, XXXX XXXX does not once respond to the identity theft I am experiencing and that is a clear and underlaying factor in each of transactions in question. 

Regarding claim XXXX XXXX XXXX for two fraudulent online transfers which occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, totaling {$6000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX states, "" the claim was denied due to there was no aggressive use of the card, ''. Without an explanation as to what BoA does consider "" aggressive use of the card '', this sentence tells me nothing. As far as I'm concerned, transferring more than 1/3 of my total funds, qualifies as extrtxemely aggressive. Additionally, this logic is in willful ignorance of the fact that I have prefaced each of my complaints with the fact that I have recently been a victim of identity theft. In the supporting documents I have submitted to both BoA claims dept, and the CFPB, I have provided a timeline of events and numerous details which verify, I was not involved in any of the transactions in questions, including the fraudulent online transfers which occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, totaling {$6000.00}. In her reasoning behind the denial of this same claim, XXXX XXXX continues, "" the transactions were several days apart, no declined attempts due to insufficient funds were found, ''. Again, while these may be metrics used by BoA to gauge the potential for fraud, neither account for identity theft. The reasoning concludes, "" the activity starts after the account received the deposits indicating knowledge of when the account receives funding '', which also tells me nothing. To what account, and to what deposits, are XXXX XXXX referring? And, how does my knowledge of when an account receives funding, make somebody else transferring {$6000.00} from my BoA account to theirs, not fraudulent? 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX provided a response to claim XXXX XXXX XXXX, for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX cash withdrawal in the amount of {$5000.00} which occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. According to XXXX XXXX, that claim was, "" denied due to the transactions listed is a XXXX XXXX Charge which was verified by identification during pick up by Bank of America before the transfer to XXXX XXXX. '' My first grievance is with XXXX XXXX 's poor diction, which makes this reasoning, as well as a majority of her letter, hard to follow. The only reason I understand what XXXX XXXX is referring to here, is due to my own research, which has lead to my understanding of several key details regarding this transaction. When XXXX XXXX states the transaction was, "" verified by identification '', I know that she means the transaction involved someone claiming to be me going into a BoA office, presenting ID, and being verified in-person. What is not included, is the fact that, this took place at a BoA in XXXX, XXXX  XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I live in XXXX XXXX, XXXX  and have not left the state since XXXX. I was verifiably at home on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not in XXXX, XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. Also, not addressed XXXX XXXX 's response, is the fact that this Emergency Cash Withdrawal was collected at a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, according to the XXXX XXXX receipt by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Again, I was verifiably at home on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not in XXXX, XXXX, nor was I in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was not involved in, not did I authorize this transaction. XXXX XXXX 'XXXX  letter does not account for, or respond to that detail, whatsoever. 

XXXX XXXX 'XXXX  response to my complaints, as well as BoA Claims department 's response to my claims, continually neglect to account for the fact that I have recently been a victim of identity theft, and have not responded to any of the supporting evidence with which I have provided them."

Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2023 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, Iowa XXXX Subject : Complaint Against Bank of America for Denial of Fraudulent Charge Claim Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a complaint against Bank of America for unjustly denying my recent claim for fraudulent charges on my credit card account ending in XXXX. Despite providing substantial evidence of the fraudulent transactions to both the bank and the XXXX Police Department, Bank of America denied my claim, citing that the card was used with the chip and/or PIN entered, and thus implying that I was responsible for the charges. 

The fraudulent transactions occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2023, and I reported them to the XXXX Police Department as part of a financial fraud investigation ( Case No : XXXX ). The total amount of the unauthorized charges is {$1300.00}. A detailed list of these transactions has already been submitted to the XXXX Police Department for investigation. 

According to the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), I am protected from liability for unauthorized charges on my credit card account. The FCBA limits my liability to {$50.00} for unauthorized charges, and many credit card issuers, including Bank of America, have a zero-liability policy for fraudulent charges. Despite this legal protection, Bank of America denied my claim and decided to remove the temporary credits applied to my account. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter and investigate the unjust denial of my claim by Bank of America. I believe that the bank 's decision to hold me responsible for the fraudulent charges, despite the evidence provided, is in violation of the FCBA and the zero-liability policy. 

Please find the attached documents, including the list of fraudulent transactions and the letter I received from Bank of America, for your reference. Please note that in my attached documents I have provided account numbers. None of these account numbers are still active, so this information may be shared. I am willing to provide any additional information or evidence required to support my complaint. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was referred to contact your office by the XXXX  Credit Reporting Agency to get help resolving an issue I have with Bank of America that I have tried to resolve myself to no avail. While experiencing financial hardship in XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted all of my creditors informing them of my plight asking for any assistant they could give until I got back on my feet. XXXX XXXX XXXX  helped by moving three payments to the rear of my loan affording me 90-days, as did XXXX XXXX who froze my account allowing me to pay only the low interest payment for 90-days ( as a result, both of those accounts are now in good standing and/or paid off ). Even though I had been a faithful customer with Bank of America since XX/XX/XXXX, they said there was nothing they could do to help so I asked them to close my account, promising to pay off my debt in the near future as soon as I was able. After allowing my account to rack up fees and interest, they finally closed my account and charged off my debt, hiring an unscrupulous attorney/debt collector who, through deceptive means, was allowed to have my wages garnished. Although that was a horribly embarrassing and financially straining situation, I am happy to report that the debt is paid ( see Attachment 1 ), but Bank of America is insisting that I owe them more money.

When I initially asked them to close my account, my original debt was approximately {$2300.00} ( see Attachment 6 ). They got the court to demand that I pay a total of {$3600.00} + {$35.00} Sheriff 's fee + {$12.00} Assessment Fee bringing the total to {$3600.00}. Further to this, the original typed court document posed the {$35.00} sheriff 's fee and {$12.00} assessment fee as one-time fees, with 0.00 % interest ( which was crossed out and replaced by a hand-written 0.98 % daily interest rate - see Attachment 2 ) and they took the {$12.00} assessment fee out of every payment for a total of approximately {$160.00} ; Despite my disputing this, they would not honor the original document. Although the last payment of this {$3600.00} total was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX, they say that I owe them more interest payments and fees ( see Attachment 3 ).

I have personally called Bank of America only to get the run-around, referring me to the attorney ; I've contacted the attorney only to get the run-around, referring me to Bank of America and the XXXX XXXX Sheriffs Department ; I've contacted the XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's Dept. only to get the run-around ; referring me back to the attorney and Bank of America. I've even disputed this with the bureaus only to have Bank of America respond with more erroneous information Bank of America has not, and, according to their representatives, will not update my credit report reflecting that this account has been paid in full ; they still report me as "" failure to pay '' with a fluctuating balance due ( see Attachments 4, 5 and 6 ).

The system is set up whereas your credit worthiness affects all areas of your life, negatively or positively. However, these creditors should not be allowed to take advantage of this system and abuse the power afforded to them by it. I take my credit standing very seriously. Before this happened to me, I had a very good credit rating and owned my own home. Everyone faces some difficulties at some point and during an extenuating circumstance, I did all that I could do at the time I asked for help. Now that I have paid the debt that I owed, and then some, Im still suffering hardship - now at the hand of Bank of America and their henchmen. I have suffered enough.

XXXX  told me that your office could help resolve this type of unfair predatory treatment from Banks. I have nowhere else to turn. Because of all of the stress and suffering I have endured, I would like this account resolved and totally removed from the credit bureaus so I can continue to rebuild and move forward with my life.

Thank you for your attention and investigation into this matter on my behalf. I look forward to hearing from you."

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I still do not have the money and no one is willing to explain why."
Credit card or prepaid card,I received an email that an application for a Bank of America credit card was opened in my name.
Credit card or prepaid card,"This dispute of unauthorized charges involves a debit card in my name, which is used by my real estate company, XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ), to issue incentive payments to me resulting from commissions from real estate transactions. Essentially, as commissions are earned at random times, the card is then loaded with various remittance amounts. This card is administered by Bank of America. 

On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, resulting from my XXXX XXXX XXXX   advising me that I should have received a commission credit to the card, I called into the Bank of America automated customer service line to verify receipt. It was at that time that I first learned that there were a series of debited transactions that I had not made. I immediately telephoned Bank of America and advised them of the unknown and unauthorized charges and they advised they would cut of the card, re-issue and new one and place a formal dispute claim. Further, they advised that all five of the disputed charges were actual swipes of the card, although I physically had it still on my person and the card was never lost nor has ever been lent to anyone else. 

Subsequently, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter ( attached ) from  them only stating that the transactions were authorized, but no detail as to how they came to that conclusion. I immediately called them and tried in vain to get an answer as to how they found the charges authorized considering that besides the charges for some items in which I have no use for ( i.e., I have been on a XXXX diet for the pass 3 months and would never go near a XXXX XXXX ) for at least 2 of  the 3 days in which the card was supposedly physically swiped in another boro, XXXX, NY, I was actually miles away at work located in another boro, XXXX, NY ( on-site clock-in/out ledger attached ). 

I of course asked if someone else, a supervisor can explain to me the seeming non-investigation and unfair conclusion that I authorized these charges and I was told no one was available but a supervisor will be calling me back. It has now been over two weeks and I have not heard from Bank of America."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Bank of America Credit Card Rewards Revocation Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my recent experience with Bank of America and the revocation of my credit card rewards without a proper explanation. I believe that my rights as a consumer have been violated, and I seek your assistance in resolving this matter. 

On [ XX/XX/2023 ], I received notification from Bank of America stating that my credit cards were cancelled & when I tried to use my rewards it didnt let me when I reached out to them I was told that was there policy and they can not give more explanation.However, despite multiple attempts to seek clarification, I have not received a satisfactory explanation for this action. As a long-standing customer of Bank of America , I have always fulfilled my obligations and maintained a good credit history. 

I am deeply concerned about the lack of transparency and communication surrounding the cancellation of my cards & rewards. I have diligently accumulated these rewards through my regular card usage, and their revocation without a valid reason has significantly impacted my trust in Bank of America as a financial institution. 

I also have all my wealth management retirement accounts with them. And that really makes me think how I should trust a institution like this. I used these cards to pay for my child classes and regular daily gas groceries etc. 

I have attempted to resolve this matter directly with Bank of Americas customer support, but I have not received a satisfactory response or a clear understanding of why my rewards were revoked. Given the circumstances, I believe it is appropriate to involve a regulatory authority like the CFPB to ensure a fair resolution. 

I kindly request that the CFPB thoroughly investigate this issue and intervene on my behalf to rectify the situation. I seek an explanation for the revocation of my credit card rewards and appropriate restitution if it is determined that Bank of America has acted in error or violated any consumer protection regulations. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and your commitment to protecting consumer rights. I look forward to a prompt and fair resolution of this complaint. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,I was an authorized user on a BofA credit card and it is reporting to my credit as a bad account. I have requested removal and for them to take it off my credit since I am not financially responsible but they have failed to do so.
Credit card or prepaid card,I have 2 fraudulent inquires on my credit report from Bank of America. i contacted me identity protection service for both inquiries and had them disputed directly with Bank of America and both were verified as fraudulent. I requested that I receive documentation for both inquiries stating that they were fraudulent. I have not received any documentation for either inquiry. The date for the first inquiry was XX/XX/XXXX and the second inquiry was XX/XX/XXXX. I requested that both of these be removed off my credit report. It has been over 90 days and both fraudulent inquiries are still showing on my credit report. I am requesting that they both be removed from my credit report.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/2020, I deposited at about XXXX local time the sum of {$600.00} CASH via ATM on XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX , CA , into my Credit Card Account ending in XXXX. 

Regrettably, on Wednesday, XX/XX/2020, Bank of America is UNLAWFULLY WITHHELD CREDITING MY ACCOUNT, in clear breach of their own Terms of Contract & Service with me-which unequivocally stipulates that Monies or Checks deposited by XXXX on a business day would be CREDITED the next business day. Accordingly, I strongly believe Bank of America 's action is not only capricious, but DISCRMINATORY as well. 
I say this because the previous week, I had tried to make a payment by XXXX for the amounts of {$77.00} and {$100.00} respectively, which was REPEATEDLY DECLINED. Bank of America sent me a Text and Email to verify these two transactions, which I promptly did. 

Indeed, on the night of XX/XX/2020, I also called Bank of America, spoke to the "" Fraud Department '', and assured them AGAIN that the aforementioned XXXX transactions were made by me. I was assured that the necessary NOTES would be made on my Credit Card account, and that my Account would not be "" blocked again ''. 

Despite this affirmation and confirmation by Bank of America fraud department staff on XXXX, Ms XXXX ( Employer ID # : XXXX ) of Bank of America `` Contact Center for Credit Card '' told me today that the reason why the {$600.00} deposit was being withheld for the next five days ( i.e. until next Monday, XX/XX/2020 from being credited was ostensibly because Bank of America was waiting for it "" to clear '' their system. This is clearly LUDICROUS and a BLATANT LIE. I mean, it's a CASH DEPOSIT-for crying out loud. 
Against this backdrop, I strongly believe that Bank of America is hell-bent ( albeit unlawfully ) to impose a FALSE NARRATIVE upon me and my account to the effect that there must some "" fraud '' going on with my credit card account. This is pernicious DISCRIMINATION."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX ( and other dates ) I received a promotional email from Bank of America about a BankAmeriDeal. According to the deal, if I used my Bank of America card to sign up from XXXX XXXX XXXX, I would be rewarded with {$5.00}. 

I signed up for XXXX XXXX XXXX  on or around XX/XX/XXXX ( according to the BoA rep I spoke with later, the transaction posted on XX/XX/XXXX on their end ). Bank of America never provided me with the {$5.00} reward. 

When I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about this, I was provided with the following explanation : Because the merchant ( XXXX ) coded the transaction as "" XXXX XXXX '' rather than "" XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX '' I was not eligible for the promotion. 

I have proof that I signed up for XXXX XXXX XXXX using my BoA credit card, and I offered to provide that proof to BoA. Bank of America said there was no way for them to review that proof and that there was nothing further they could do. 

I believe this was a deceptive practice. If Bank of America meant that I would get {$5.00} for signing up for "" XXXX XXXX, '' they should have said that in their promotion. But they said that I would get {$5.00} if I signed up for "" XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' I did sign up for XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they refused to give me the {$5.00} bonus. It's unfair for them to not hold up their end of the bargain. Their back-end coding issue, which was never disclosed upfront, should not excuse them for refusing to follow through with their end of the bargain that they advertised."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I tried to make a payment at an atm on XX/XX/2020 for {$130.00} and the atm took my payment and gave me a receipt with a number to call. The is interesting due to I took payment from one credit before I tried to pay and I "" also '' have proof of this transaction as well. 

The encounter was at bank of america atm on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX. The location was 8 mile & XXXX in XXXX Michigan. The receipt # XXXX. I had to wait for 2 billing cycles and was told I would have an answer by XX/XX/XXXX. They implied not to pay my card until the problem was resolved and I would have had late payments on my credit file by now. 

Please have to issue my payment back to my card and wave interest charges for one month because I had to pay interest on coming up with the payment to repay the payment that was taken. We should not have to wait two months on something that was not a customer fault especially during XXXX time. It is a really unfair method."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America sent a pre-approved offer for an XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX card to my previous address. Someone intercepted the offer and completed the application, resulting in a 3 bureau credit check on my social security number. I normally have my credit frozen, but had purchased a car earlier in the year and forgot to re-freeze my data. 

The date of the inquiry was XX/XX/22. I was in XXXX on business when I received the notification of inquiry from multiple credit monitoring sources and immediately contacted Bank of America. The phone number provided requires jumping through many hoops to get through to a fraud specialist because the initial firewall asks for customer information. Not being a BofA customer makes it extremely difficult to get through to a human being and it took several attempts to make the correct combination of verbal requests to not be disconnected. This was at great expense, as I was calling from XXXX. 

BofA informed me that the account was not opened due to incorrect date of birth. I asked them to have the inquiry removed from all three bureaus and place a fraud alert under my social security number. Their response was for me to contact all three bureaus and do it myself. 

This is not the correct response. I did not initiate a business relationship with Bank of America. It should not be MY responsibility to go through the long and drawn out process of contacting each of the three credit bureaus to dispute an inquiry that I did not initiate, nor authorize. 

Bank of America is careless and does not act in the interest of consumers. Later, I received two items of correspondence from BofA. the first was a request for more information in order to open the account. Thankfully, it was XXXX class mail and was forwarded to my new address. In the request, it asked for more information to open the account and it also provided my credit score. Had this not been forwarded to my new address, it would have assisted the perpetrator in continuing their attempt to defraud me. 

They also sent a letter to my current address with a case number. The letter stated : "" Unfortunately, we couldn't complete your request because we need additional information. If you have any questions about what to send, give us a call at XXXX. We look forward to hearing from you soon. '' When I contacted them at the number provided, they said that case number meant nothing to them and they had no way of looking it up. Why would BofA send out a letter like this, requesting a call and then not be able to address it? 

Bank of America 's careless handling of my personal credit information and lack of action to correct the damage they have caused has caused my credit score to drop and make it appear as if I am seeking credit. This is personally damaging if I needed to apply for legitimate credit with a lender. I am afraid that my only option will be to take legal action against Bank of America. They have XXXX acountability."
Credit card or prepaid card,"So, because of my untimely payments, I incurred several months of late payments with my Bank of America credit card and all my other credit cards. I contacted all of my credit card companies and I told them what occurred and the reason why I was late. All of the other banks agreed to take off all the late payments on the account, and subsequently, I paid the current payment due as part of the agreement. I contacted Bank of America and I asked if I could have the late payments waived. The agent asked what were the issues and the reason why I was late at the time, ( I was two months late ). I told them once again the reason due to me studying for the XXXX XXXX XXXX ; I had to reduce my work hours. The manager online listened and said that there is nothing that he could do. If I dont pay the late fees the credit card account will be charged off. Now, the late fees have increased now I am up to six months in late payments, when I first contacted Bank of America I had two months of late fees. They have charged off the card in their system and I can not use the card again. The Bank offered me a settlement and I told them on XXXX XXXX, 2017 - I was willing to pay {$700.00} as settlement while I was in the branch X/XX/2017 ... but the customer service agent was adamant about charging me {$1000.00} to settle the account. At this point I am done with Bank of America. They are continuing charging me fees and interest. I need to settle this account and get them off my credit report. My credit report is suffering in the interim. Please help me! Thank you,"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My on-site experience at XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/2021, while leaving the XXXX XXXX store located on the second floor of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WA, I walked past the second floor stores when I was solicited by and literally pulled into the XXXX XXXX XXXX store by a very aggressive salesperson named XXXX who told me he had a product that would take away the wrinkles under my eyes. While inside the store, I was surrounded and distracted by XXXX XXXX XXXX their supposed XXXX  ) as well as XXXX XXXX their supposed Store Manager ). Their business cards and contact information are attached to this dispute, ref ( 1 ). They all hovered around me pushing their products on me. 
I decided to purchase just ONE product, after refusing many times, only to finally have them convince me by discounting the price by 50 % and the offer of one free product along with one free facial. Both products are described in the next section. I was offered the free facial, by XXXX XXXX which I scheduled for XX/XX/2021. It was understood there would be NO CHARGE for this service. I went back to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2021 to receive my free facial treatment. I did not purchase ANYTHING nor did I authorize ANY charges during that visit. 
These ( 2 ) occasions were the only times I was physically inside XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WA. At the end of XX/XX/2021, I discovered during a shopping trip to the XXXX XXXX XXXX that XXXX XXXX XXXX was no longer in business at XXXX XXXX XXXX when I encountered their empty store with their XXXX XXXX  sign gone. I took a picture which is attached to this dispute, ref ( 2 ). I flagged down a XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX guard to ask when XXXX XXXX had left the mall and what happened to them. She told me it had been a few weeks ago and nothing more. I also asked the employees of a business, XXXX XXXX, on the first floor nearby. They verified with me that XXXX XXXX had indeed left the mall a few weeks ago. They said the employees of this store would come and go and would not always be open which is against the mall rules. Their impression of this business was that it was rather sketchy and mysterious. 
Details of my XXXX XXXX XXXX purchase on XX/XX/2021 I made a purchase at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2021 in the amount of {$220.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX product and I received a free XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX product. The receipt for that transaction is attached to this dispute ref ( 3 ). This purchase was charged to my XXXX  credit card and the charge shows up on my XXXX  credit card statement as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX WA in the Description column, in the correct amount of {$220.00}. 
What is noteworthy to mention was that I was surrounded and distracted by XXXX XXXX XXXX their supposed XXXX  ) as well as XXXX XXXX their supposed Store Manager ) during my purchase. They gave me a sparkling water to add to my distraction. Looking back on this unfortunate experience, I realized I may have perhaps left my purse unattended during all the commotion and distraction. 
Details of the Fraudulent, Unauthorized credit card charges The 1st ( 2 ) fraudulent, unauthorized charges were made on XX/XX/2021, in the amount of {$3000.00} on my XXXX credit card and {$9100.00} on my Bank of America ( BOA ) credit card. I did not receive any services, products, receipts or any other information regarding these fraudulent, unauthorized charges. 
The 3rd fraudulent, unauthorized charge was in the amount of {$27000.00} on XX/XX/2021 on my XXXX  credit card. While I was at XXXX XXXX receiving my free facial treatment on XX/XX/2021, I left the treatment room and against my better judgement, I left my purse unattended hanging on a hook in the treatment room. They wanted me to look at my skin in the light of the store in the large mirrors. XXXX XXXX and the Store Manager XXXX were literally in my face saying how beautiful my skin was, etc., which was very distracting to me and gave me a sparkling water to add to the commotion. 
Also, on XX/XX/2021 there was a charge for {$13000.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX which BOA declined. The BOA Fraud department informed me of this great news after I reported the fraudulent, unauthorized {$9100.00} charge to BOA made on XX/XX/2021. 
I did not receive any services, products, receipts or any other information regarding these ( 3 ) fraudulent, unauthorized charges. All 3 fraudulent, unauthorized charges showed up on both my XXXX  and BOA credit card statements in the Description column as XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX WA. This is the exact same description at the top of the credit card receipt for the initial, sole, valid credit card purchase I made at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I have no idea what was to be purchased by the ( 3 ) fraudulent, outrageous, unauthorized charges. I received NO products, services or receipts regarding these charges and no information was given to me by XXXX XXXX  or any other company about why the charges were made. That is still the case. 
I SPECULATE THAT MY CREDIT CARDS WERE TAKEN OUT OF MY WALLET IN MY PURSE BY AN EMPLOYEE ( S ) WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE AND PERMISSION AND PURCHASES WERE MADE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION. 
I noticed all ( 3 ) of these fraudulent, unauthorized charges while doing a random check of my credit card balances on XX/XX/2021. 
I was very surprised that I NEVER received a call or text from XXXX or BOA about these outrageous charges from XXXX XXXX asking if they were legitimate prior to them accepting the charges. I have a history of NOT making large purchases on my credit cards and wondered why I wasnt somehow notified. XXXX  and BOA ACCEPTED these fraudulent, unauthorized charges. The only reason BOA declined the {$13000.00} on XX/XX/2021 because this card had a limit of {$11000.00} and had already been charged {$9100.00} on XX/XX/2021. 
Both my BOA and XXXX  statements reflecting the fraudulent, unauthorized charges are attached to this dispute, ref ( 4 ) thru ( 11 ). 
Filing claims with XXXX  and BOA for fraudulent, unauthorized charges On XX/XX/2021, I filed fraud claims with XXXX  and BOA for these fraudulent, unauthorized charges. On XX/XX/2021, I received a letter from BOA stating that were unable to approve your recent fraud claim. They stated that We confirmed your card was used for the charge ( s ). The chip was read, your PIN was entered, and/or you signed for the merchandise or service, which indicated you or someone you allowed to use your card was present. This statement can not be true. They offered no proof of their assertions, because none exists. 
I asked that the claim be re-evaluated and I received a letter from BOA on XX/XX/2021 stating that our decision to decline your fraud claim for this transaction ( s ) hasnt changed. They offered no new data ; they just used the exact same words ( above ) from their initial evaluation. again. 
On XX/XX/2021, I received a letter from XXXX stating that Upon concluding our investigation of your recent fraud claim, we have determined the following transaction ( s ) was/were authorized. The {$3000.00} and {$27000.00} fraudulent, unauthorized charges were listed. They added that You have received benefit from the transaction ( s ) by either receiving services and/or merchandise from the merchant. This statement also can not be true. They offered no proof of their assertions, because none exists. 
All BOA and XXXX  correspondence regarding these fraudulent, unauthorized charges are attached to this dispute, ref ( 12 ) ( 17 ). 
Police / Security reports made of these events I called the XXXX Police Department and a XXXX Police Report was filed for these exact events. It is report number XXXX, dated XX/XX/2021 and updated on XX/XX/2021. This report was made by XXXX Officer XXXX, badge # XXXX. I requested Officer  XXXX  to press charges against XXXX XXXX XXXX for fraudulent, unauthorized charges on my credit cards that I DID NOT AUTHORIZE. 
I reported the events to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX security company, who also has many reports on file against XXXX XXXX, including mine. The XXXX XXXX XXXX case number XXXX  XXXX. XXXX XXXX is the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Personal Research into XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has a very solid reputation as a very high-pressure and fraudulent sales organization XXXX. What I experienced at their store was very high-pressure sales, a lot of employees surrounding me, and a lot of confusion and distraction. I have attached, ref ( 18 ) ( 20 ), an article from XXXX magazine that exemplifies XXXX XXXX XXXX reputation. A simple XXXX search of XXXX XXXX XXXX brings up a huge number of fraud/scam articles/reports against XXXX XXXX XXXX. Here are just a few worth mentioningthere are MANY, MANY, MORE!

I never removed my BOA credit card from my wallet in their store. I SPECULATE THAT MY CREDIT CARDS WERE TAKEN OUT OF MY WALLET IN MY PURSE BY AN EMPLOYEE ( S ) WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE AND PERMISSION AND PURCHASES WERE MADE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION. 
I did nothing wrong except walk past an XXXX XXXX store before getting solicited and then pulled into the store by an aggressive salesperson. Looking back, I shouldve broken free and just kept on walkingbut I was taken completely by surprise. 
XXXX and BOA did something very wrong by accepting fraudulent, unauthorized charges to my credit cards. XXXX XXXX Cosmetics are complete SCAM ARTISTS and XXXX and BOA refuse to go after these XXXX  for their fraud. Instead, XXXX  and BOA are choosing to dump their problem on me, the customer.

I saw the fee and called to manually pay the statement balance over the phone. This was done, but the employee also paid the late fee. I then had to work to have it reversed. Fast forward to a couple days ago, and Bank of America debits my account XXXX! There was no balance! That is effectively stealing, and while they took it out right away, it will take XXXX business days to put it back in."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was awarded unemployment benefits over 4 weeks ago. I never got a card from Bank of America EDD because they never sent one. I called them and asked why my money hasnt been transferred to my bank account. I had it set up to transfer. They said well you have to to that with your new card, but we never sent you one. 
So they said they were sending a new card. Here it is over a week later and still no card. I called them and they said I have to wait up to 14 days to get the new debit card. I asked why dont you just transfer the money to my bank account. They said we cant do that because you have to set it up with your new card. 
So I have been waiting 6 weeks now for my unemployment debit card from the thieves at Bank of America. They say there is nothing they can do. They say I just have to wait. 
They also asked me if I k ow how many people they are dealing with. I said no its not my concern."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hi Boa ; I just came from your local branch because my card hasn't been working and they said that my card was closed. I checked with my credit report now, and it showed 3 consecutive missed payments. I made my last payment with BoA of over $ 200+ back in XXXX / XXXX and never used the card again. How is it possible that i have a bill of {$50.00} with you guys. Plus I never received any emails, texts, mailed about my statements in order to alert me of any missed payments. The fact I never used the card since my last payment, I wasn't aware that i owed that amount of money. The bank Rep pulled an old statement from the archive and went through a transaction from "" identity '' subscriptions that i never opened before. My card was compromised and they immediately closed whatever account and initiated an investigation, to have that money returned to the bank of America. THat's a fraud that happened and I'm not liable for it plus I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me, or the payment was not applied as fast as expected. I check my bank account and noticed that you deducted the money out of my checking account on the month that you marked me late on my credit report. Please remove those 3 last payments that you reported on my account."

XX/XX/18 Called Bank of America credit card dispute services to confirm receipt a second time and was informed that I need to go back to merchant."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My Bank of America Visa credit card has this policy regarding interest payments : "" PAYING INTEREST - We will not charge interest on Purchases on the next statement if you pay the New Balance Total in full by the Payment Due Date, and you had paid in full by the previous Payment Due Date. We will begin charging interest on Balance Transfers and Cash Advances on the transaction date. '' I paid off my balance in full last month and see that this month I was charged a "" minimum interest charge '' XX/XX/XXXX MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE XXXX What??!! Since when do I have to pay interest when my balance at the beginning of the statement period was XXXX? I called the bank and was told that it is their policy to charge interest on a zero balance if in the previous statement there was an unpaid balance on the card. But, of course, I was charged interest on that unpaid balance THEN so effectively I am being charged interest twice, which looks like theft to me."
Credit card or prepaid card,I received a letter from Bank of America stating that they received a credit card application in my name ( which I did not submit ). I think that I am now a victim of identity theft.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2022 XXXX  at XXXX I was made a payment to my credit card for Bank of America ATM machine out side a Bank of America located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX, ATM ID is XXXX the card # is XXXX Amount is {$1200.00}, but when i taped the view bill tape the screen was frozen there, non of the button on the ATM was working anymore, after a few minutes the ATM just took my money, ATM didnt give me receipts and there werent payment transactions appear on my account balance, I called the credit card company right away until now they didnt have any answer for me I am kind of stressed out."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Arrived home from vacation with a credit card opened in my name. The card is in my name and sent to my home address, but the originator of the card is an address in North Carolina. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, NC XXXX. I contacted Bank of America on XX/XX/2022. The account was closed and it was recommended I contact my local authorities, file a report with the FTC.gov, and notify the credit bureau to make sure the account is closed and removed and that no other accounts have been opened in my name."
Credit card or prepaid card,"We received the Bank of America credit card in XX/XX/2022 with 0 % interest. I was supposed to be charged 0 % interest rates for 21 months. I was never told by the bank that they were going to be charging any interest rates prior to 21 months. However, the bank imposed an interest rate that was not agreed upon or discussed with me. I took out the card because I was promised a 0 % interest rate for 21 months. I would like the interest rate to go back to 0 % and Bank of America to refund me for the extra fees paid to Bank of America from XXXX until current ( XXXX ). I would like Bank of America to be held accountable for a classic bait and switch."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I signed up for an XXXX XXXX Bank of America credit card years ago. When I received the card, I set up my account so that there would be 'automatic payments ' deducted from my checking account for the full balance each month. It worked as it should for many years. 

Then, Bank of America canceled my automatic payments. I did not realize this until after I had missed two billing cycles, so I had accumulated late fees and interest. 

When I called Bank of America on XX/XX/23, they told me that I had deactivated automatic payments on XX/XX/23. This is not accurate. I did not do this. 

I requested that they reverse the late fees and accumulated interested. They emailed me on XX/XX/23 to notify me that they declined my request to remove the fees and interest."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In early XXXX, Bank of America sent out two promotional balance offers. One was a 0 % interest rate balance transfer good through XX/XX/XXXX and the other was a 1.5 % balance transfer good through a certain date. I used the 0 % offer check for {$30000.00} to cover repair costs for a XX/XX/XXXX flood that is currently on my home equity line of credit. 

I accessed my online Bank of America account on XX/XX/XXXX to discover a {$1200.00} check transaction charge. After calling Bank of America 's customer service number, the agent explained that a 4 %, or {$1200.00}, transaction fee was assessed for this balance transfer. In order for Bank of America to reverse the 4 % transaction fee, I had to pay the {$30000.00} transfer back today, which I have done. I will have to call back tomorrow after the payment posts to ensure that the transaction fee is reversed. 

This offer is predatory and misleading to consumers. Most people who take advantage of these offers will not be able to pay back the loan immediately and are assessed a fee higher than the typical credit card transaction fee, which typically average 3 %. Please make sure that consumers are protected from false advertising on balance transfers."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was making a Bank of America credit card payment on XX/XX/2019 when the process became longer than usual. Because I paid from another banks checking account in the past, I usually asked if I want to use the same bank for payment to make it a shorter and quicker process. Instaead on this date of XX/XX/2019 around sometime in the after noon California the I was prompted to give all the outside bank '' s Iinformation - Routing and account information, which the bank would remember from past and not ask for in detail. I called later to ask a representative and she said it was a system wide glitch. She seemed nice, but did not say it would be present to the public as a notification to be aware of as happening are shared with CFPB. So I am reporting it and hopefully actions and methods will go back to a use the reflects retention of secure information and hint identification for smoother and secure transactions and future use."

Credit card or prepaid card,"on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received an email from Bank of America stating my credit line had been decreased. 

I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to understand why, the rationale was completely arbitrary and when speaking with the "" underwriter '' she stated they pulled a soft inquiry and evaluated my deposits into my checking account. 

My credit line was decreased {$2000.00}. I have been a credit card holder through Bank of America for 12 years and have never gone delinquent. 

I recently closed 4 accounts ( paying total owed off ) that may be affiliated with Bank of America leaving my only open credit account to be with Bank of America. 

from an income perspective this is my highest income year since I 've had the card. the rationale does not seem to be based in fact. 

please help me understand if this is a fair practice."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This complaint is in response to DENIAL on my claim, That I Initiated on XX/XX/2018 due to me being a victim of FRAUD SCHEMES. 
I have the legal right to a full and proper investigation under The Fair Credit Billing Act and The Truth In Lending Act Federal Law. 
I do feel that my rights have been violated due to not receiving a proper and fair investigation under my circumstances. BOA has failed me by NOT conducting a reasonable investigation of my dispute accordion to the Law. 
I Initiated my claim on XX/XX/2018 by calling BOA where I explained my situation of what my claim was all about and also expressed that I was aware that I was over the time of a dispute but under the circumstances of my claim they felt that my case needed to be investigated. The person in the dispute department opened a case for my dispute and told me I should be receiving a letter in the mail in a few days asking for more information. 
So on XX/XX/2018 BOA send me a message through my online banking asking additional information And also letting me know that they received my claim and it is currently being researched. 
On XX/XX/2018 they send other message though my online banking and this was Details about your claim - refer to letter. When I opened the letter it was CLAIM DENIAL LETTER. So within TWO days of opening my claim I had been denied. 
To make matter worse I had no clue that they would commit to me through a message in my online account because the person I spoke to said ( I would be receiving a letter in the mail ) So I would be checking my mail box very day. By the time I received the letter in the mail on XX/XX/2018 asking for additional information I had already been denied of my claim on XX/XX/2018. 
So I happened to login to my online banking account to get some info that I need while fill out the paper work I just received in the mail only to see that I had messages from BOA and I have already been denied of my claim even before it even started. 
I proceeded to call BOA on XX/XX/2018 to find out what was going because I didnt understand why I was denied. The person that I spoke in the dispute department couldnt even tell me why I was denied he said ( maybe because they didnt receive the info they requested ) I explained to him that I just received the letter in the mail just today and I have not been given enough time to respond to the letter and I had no clue that I had message because I have never done this before and I had been informed that I will be contacted though mail regarding this matter. 
The representative on the phone was so cold and unbothered about my situation he later said just send you paper work back and will reopen your case when we receive it but he actually reopened it the same day XX/XX/2018. 
To my surprise just to realize that on XX/XX/2018 when I login to my account that I was denied again the next day which was XX/XX/2018. 
I decided to call again on XX/XX/2018 because at this point am very confused and very frustrated. This time the representative on the phone was very warm and very understanding. I explained my situational to him and he informed me that I was denied because they didnt receive my contract. I continued to tell him that one I have not been given enough time to respond to any demands that they are requesting of me and second letting him know that I didnt receive a contract from XXXX and I have no way of getting on now under the circumstances. He was very understanding and he said ( On yes under those circumstances they should not ask for a contract ) He reopened my case and he assured that I will not be denied again because he has noted in my case that they need to investigate my claim. 
To my surprise I was denied again the following day on XX/XX/2018 at this point am beyond frustrated and extremely confused. 
I called again on XX/XX/2018 and this time the representative was not pleasant at all he let me know I was denied because I didnt give a contract and I was past the deadline. I tried to explain my self and my situation but he was not willing to listen and he made it very clear they will not be helping me any further on this claim. 
BOA didnt Investigated my claim. They used frustration tactics so one can give up on their claim. 
There is no way that a fair and complete investigation was contacted in one to two days. BOA will open a claim today and close and deny the following day. They will give you two days or less to respond to there demands by asking you to upload documents and if you dont they close you case and deny you claim and now you have to call them to find out what going on and it takes time to get to the right department and if you speak to them and ask them to reopen you case and let you upload your documents they say you have to send them by mail and then when they get them they will open the case and later on they open it but dont let you upload but by the time they receive the document by mail they have denied you already. They have no intention of helping you there main goal is frustrating you to giving up the pursue of your claim. I have been I loyal consumer of BOA for many years with no incident and am very shock of how they treat their customers. 
I am a victim of fraud schemes and I purchased educational service ( which I though that would be beneficial to my life ) with XXXX that cost me over {$60.00} thousand of which I paid {$18000.00} using this BOA credit card. I paid the rest using other different cards and those credit card companies have been very helpful and understanding and they are still investigating all my claims as I write this. I have provided everything that I could get about this case to BOA but still not enough. 
I am filling this complaint for myself and also to help all others that are victims of this fraud schemes by XXXX. I know we are a lot of us who are going through this with BOA. We have a facebook group to help each other through this nightmare and everyone is complaining about BOA and it treatment about this situation."
Credit card or prepaid card,On XX/XX/2020 I took my California issued unemployment prepaid card to a Bank of America drive-thru ATM to withdraw an amount of {$800.00} to pay for my rent. Upon initiating the transaction the ATM box stalls for a second and then complete transaction but dispenses me no money and only a receipt. At that point I contact a Bank of America rep by calling the number listed on the ATM box who then advises mean to go within the branch and notify them because within his system he stated he could see the transaction had completed and the money was withdrawn from my account but no cash was dispensed at that point. If I'm going inside the branch and ATM teller tells me there's nothing that they can do as they do not service the EDD card so then I am advised to contact a number on the back of the card when doing so I was told I needed to file a claim I went ahead and start the process a filing a claim and have been waiting almost two weeks now and just as of today the XXXX of XX/XX/2020 my card company advises me that my provisional credit has been denied and that it is customer reliable which makes absolutely no sense because there are cameras surrounding the bank area and if the investigation was thorough as the state it would be then they should be able to see that no cash was given at that point when I was at the ATM and I should have been issued my money in return.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found a late payment on the date below : XXXX days late as of XX/XX/2021 ( all XXXX bureaus ) I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payment to you when I received my statement. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me. I am trying to buy a new home and was shocked to see this, as my payments are always on time. Thank you"
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I found myself unable to pay my credit card bill. Was given online payment assistance options, and after sending a message electronically -- I got a reply days later, asking me to call their payment assistance line. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent BofA written correspondence, explaining my current financial circumstances and requesting payment assistance. On the XXXX, I decided to take the extra step to call the line -- which then, a representative heard my financial situation, and referred me to a debt settlement program which she referred to as "" credit counseling ''. I was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX, which then referred me to XXXX XXXX, a debt settlement program which encouraged me not to communicate with BofA and to not pay them a single cent. I didn't think this was right, so I looked at non-profit credit counseling programs. I found InCharge Debt Relief, which helped me work out payment arrangements with three creditors, all except Bank of America, which did not want to work with me, as in their opinion, me keeping more than one emergency credit card open was not acceptable to them. I also have never received a response to my written correspondence. I may use this complaint as evidence, if Bank of America chooses litigation, as I have gone above and beyond to try and settle this debt in a way that is not financially crushing to me, an unemployed ( for 10 months now ) young adult with no income or assets that is currently struggling to pay day-to-day bills, and yet it is Bank of America who has not shown any willingness to settle this matter. I have told you many times, over written correspondence, your recorded lines, your online messaging that, and instead of understanding my hardship, Bank of America continues to remain silent, and request the original payment amount."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Despite living exclusively in the United States for over 8 years now bank of America keeps sending me threatening notices requesting update in my residency documents because I am a citizen of XXXX. They once refused to accept the document I provided ( simply because it was not in their list of accepted documents ) and put a freeze on my saving and checking account forcing me to close my account with them. I still hold an old credit line with them and the letters keep coming like clockwork with a very short deadline ( few days ) for document submission and they threaten to freeze my access to the credit cards. This has happened over the past 8 years continuously even though I have a clear source of salary from my job which I completely use for my everyday living in the US. I had zero overseas purchase or anything that can be remotely related to a sanctioned country. I kept my legal residence here in the US for all these years and haven't even left the country since my initial arrival in XXXX 

This is a textbook violation of the federal equal credit opportunity act which prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicant son the basis of national origin. 

I am working with 4 other creditors and banks in the US and and unlike what they claim, BOA is the only institution that has this unreasonable and discriminatory policy."
Credit card or prepaid card,In XXXX I found out that my unemployment benefits were being cashed by a roommate She helped me file my claim and I got a denial letter from XXXX and I thought my claim was denied. Wasn't the case. She cashed out over XXXX k of my money. The bank closed my account took five months to open back up and paid me only XXXX of the XXXX that was stolen.thr bank has denied my claim again and you're my last resort.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I filed for unemployment benefits with CA EDD in XXXX and had been unsuccessfully trying to get ahold of a live person for 8 months before returning to work and giving up completely. Then once I was laid off again due to Covid, I attempted to contact EDD in order to discuss my claim and why I was able to certify but had never received a payment. At the end of XX/XX/XXXX I finally reached someone at EDD who explained to me that all of my payments had been issued to my Bank of America account... 
An account that I didnt know I had, with a debit card Id never received. I contacted Bank of America immediately to find out how to access MY funds. Just to be told that my account had been depleted and there was no money. BoA sent out 4 cards to an address where I do not even live. I never received a card nor did I have knowledge of an account with BofA. A claim was filed and I was told Id be notified by mail the outcome of an investigation. My claim was denied a few days later with the basis that some of the charges were over 365 days old therefor Im responsible for all of the charges. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?! I had NO knowledge of this account so how can I be responsible for it? How is it possible for b of a to tell me I am responsible for money I never even received and then refuse to give me back the money that is rightfully mine and stolen by someone. If Bank of America did their investigation properly then they would know that NONE of those charges made on debit cards they sent to the WRONG address, were made by me. I was never issued a provisional credit during the investigation and the reasoning of because the charges were made over 365 days ago being why Im denied MY MONEY, is unfair and misused considering I was NEVER AWARE I even had money in an account with them. And what about the visa zero liability policy? There are 4 claim numbers total. 

- XXXX - XXXX - XXXX - XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I inadvertertently transferred more than {$3500.00} from my savings account to my credit card account linked on the Bank of America website instead of my checking account. I have a positive balance of {$3500.00} and every time I call to have this returned to my checking account I get a different story of how long it will take. First person said 10 days. I asked for an escalation and was told to even get into the escalation process it would take at least 5 days. It has now been two weeks and the next call I was given i was told it could take up to TWO billing cycles to return my money... up to 60 days. 

This represents an entire paycheck. This has made it so I am now late in paying my mortgage and my credit rating is going to take a big hit. I am stressed and can not sleep well. 

Please tell me there is a recourse to get Bank of America to do the right thing."
Credit card or prepaid card,"We have been disputing a fraudulent charge with Bank of America twice but unfortunately both fraud claims got rejected by BOA. The fraud case happened inside the XXXX  XXXX gas station in XXXX XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/2020, XXXX XXXX  in our way to the airport. We stopped to fill in the gas tank and the employee at the gas station asked us for the credit card in order to swipe it and make the charge of {$37.00} but the transaction was immediately rejected and we had to pay cash instead. More importantly, at the same moment, we received 2 emails and 2 SMS text messages alerts from Bank of America about 2 unrecognized transactions. 
There were 2 charges made on the card at the same time ( XX/XX/2020, XXXX XXXX ) for {$37.00} and another one for {$470.00}. The problem we are disputing is the second transaction for XXXX by another MERCHANT "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and according to the email we got from BOA, the merchant is also located in XXXX. When we received the emails, we followed the instructions as noted in the email and took action to deny the unrecognized transaction and we asked the bank to close the account and send us a new card and they did. 
We did not engage in any transactions with XXXX XXXX for {$470.00}. It is absolutely a scam/fraud and we are disputing this charge. Please see the attachment for the 2 emails we received from Bank of America about the 2 transactions and you can check the transaction timestamp. Both happened at the same time when the employee at the gas station tried to swipe the card. 

We are requesting your help to investigate this case with BOA very thoroughly."

Thank you."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Over the past year and a half, I have been made numerous attempts to Bank of America requesting them to stop making automatic debit payments from my  checking account to my credit cards, which I was paying already every month. 

After numerous futile attempts to get them to stop, I filed a fraudulent payments complaint at Bank of America, who then closed both of my credit card accounts without any communication or contact with me, using an excuse that my limits were too high, in spite of my never making a late payment. 

The account numbers in question are a Platinum Plus XXXX/last four digits-XXXX Visa Signature/last four digits-XXXX."

I downloaded a document to give to the Refinancing Bank. I was asked by XXXX if I wanted to continue receiving their service and I said : no. 
However, XXXX continued charging my credit card. Therefore, I had to close my credit card. Bank of America returned me three months that I paid. But after I sent a letter with all the info they wanted, they gave me a short time to answer them again. The time period was very short, so they gave me the possibility to send them a fax with the proof that I canceled XXXX. I did not have time to cancel, a service that never asked for, because after I complained to Bank of America, XXXX canceled my service. It seems that they never read my fax because they sent me a letter telling that : "" Because I did not send the cancelation '' they sided with XXXX and they told me that not only they will not give me my money back but also they will charge me again for the three months they had returned the money."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been trying to fix this issue since XX/XX/2019. Bank of America has now screwed up two of my accounts trying to fix it. I wrote my last letter on XX/XX/2019, and have not heard from them since. I am so frustrated I am at my wit 's end. 

On XX/XX/2019, I made a payment from my bill pay account to the wrong account. The account ending in XXXX was no longer an active account. I did not realize this until my credit card showed I had not made my payment. In investigating this, I realized what I had done. I then called Bank of America 's toll-free number and spoke with an agent and she said she would send my information to another department for investigation and they would get back to me. When I did not hear from anyone, I called back and got the same song and dance. After another interval without hearing from anyone, I decided I would message my concerns from the internal messaging system in my account. I sent no less than 8 messages, with only "" canned '' or no responses. 

It was then I started my letter-writing campaign. My first letter was dated XX/XX/2019, and Bank of America sent me a letter back, dated XX/XX/2019, stating they could not find the payment I was talking about. This, even though, I had sent a detailed letter explaining everything and copies of all the documentation ( even a screen print of the account the {$57.00} payment was made to ). 

I wrote them back on XX/XX/2019, and sent all the attachments again and explained the situation again. On XX/XX/2019, I received a letter stating they had found the {$57.00} and credited it to my account. What they actually did was take a payment made to my husband 's credit card and put that money toward 's my account. 

My last letter was dated XX/XX/2019, and was directed to a Manager and told them what they did was totally wrong. I, once again, included all the documentation and told them EXACTLY what had happened. 

Since this last letter, I have heard nothing from them. It has now been over a month. This shouldn't be that hard. I told them exactly where the money went and gave them proof of that multiple times. I just want my accounts fixed."
Credit card or prepaid card,"BANK OF AMERICA ( BofA ) UNFAIRLY REPORTED ME XXXX  days late over a {$25.00} payment during the COVID-19 Pandemic and refuses to work with me to correct the credit reporting. My XXXX credit report reflects a XXXX  day late from BofA in XX/XX/XXXX. This was not only during the COVID-19 Pandemic, but I had significant life event changes too : my first child in XX/XX/XXXX, went on maternity thereafter to take care of newborn in full quarantine without any outside assistance, I sold my house in XX/XX/XXXX, moved into and remodeled a house in XX/XX/XXXX, and left my job to start my own business. The payment amount was extremely minor - many institutions do not even report XXXX day late, and many others do not do so for amounts under {$50.00} or {$100.00}. This practice is extremely unfair. This negative reporting will stay on my credit for XXXX  years! 

BofA WILL NOT WORK WITH ME OR HELP to fix this problem, and repeatedly gave me false information over the phone. I escalated to a supervisor and he continued to give me false and misleading information. This is deceptive. BofA initially told me they reported me because I was XXXX  days late. That is false. They lied to try to make my complaint go away. The {$25.00} payment was due XX/XX/XXXX and the account was paid in full ( {$70.00} ) on XX/XX/XXXX. BofA lied to me to justify their unfair reporting. As mentioned, I was so busy and stressed during the pandemic I simply did not notice the {$60.00} balance triggering the penalty. I can not even see what transaction caused the balance because their online banking makes it so difficult to understand my account information. 

BofA HARMED ME THROUGH UNFAIR POLICIES. The Agent on the phone lied and told me they do not report any delinquencies until 60 days late. When I told him mine was XXXX days late, he lied and said it was actually XXXX  days late. He also told me that they will only report XXXX day lates, and they may have had a different XXXX day late policy in XXXX. If they have recently determined XXXX day late reporting is unfair and shifted to only XXXX day reporting, why are they refusing to delete my XXXX day late which occurred on a small balance during the pandemic!? That makes no sense. I am being harmed solely because my issue happened during the pandemic and not today - by their own words, if I was XXXX  days late today, I would not be reported, but because I was XXXX  days late in XXXX, I was reported. That is totally unfair! 

BofA REFUSED TO LOG MY COMPLAINT. The Supervisor on the phone said he could not help me log a complaint. He said BofA DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROCESS FOR AGENTS TO LOG COMPLAINTS even though I was on the phone complaining and begging to have them log and escalate my complaint. The agent told me they do not have a complaint department. He told me he did not have anywhere to log or send my complaint. The website also does not have a complaint portal, only contact for customer service, the same people who just told me they can not log complaints. 

BofA HAS HARMED MY CREDIT SCORE IMPACTING MY ABILITY TO OBTAIN FAIR AND ACCESSIBLE CREDIT PRODUCTS. The impact here is not justified. As mentioned above, during significant hardship and a pandemic, BofA declined humane and fair treatment. They refuse to correct their harm. They have lied to try to persuade me from pursuing my complaint. They have wasted my time and resources. This credit score impacted my ability to help my husband finance his lease on our car. I am currently seeking credit elsewhere, but my score is impact. 

I WANT TO CLOSE MY CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT BUT CAN NOT UNTIL THIS IS FIXED. If I close my account, I am positive BofA will retialite by refusing to address my issue and admit their practices unfairly harmed me. A XXXX day late on a follow {$25.00} payment should not follow me for XXXX years. That is unfair. 

BofA, A REPEAT OFFENDER, SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR ILLEGAL, UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, AND ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES, INCLUDING THEIR FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT A COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT INTAKE ACROSS FRONT LINES AS PART OF AN EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. I BELIEVE BOFA IS VIOLATING BOTH SECTION 5 OF THE FTC ACT AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT. Also, these practices may amount to violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or practices.

BofA should also be investigated for discriminatory practices. As a female, minority, mother, I can not help but wonder whether they apply this same credit reporting treatment across their entire credit card population. Somebody should closely analyze BofA 's credit reporting correction and complaint practices to identify whether they have issues with differential treatment across protected classes and historically discriminated populations.

As an attorney, I am appalled at their blatant disregard for government regulation and guidance. BofA is a repeat offender and does not utilize fair practices. This is shocking disregard for consumer financial protection."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Since about XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America has not fixed the identity theft that occurred with stolen identity. Checking accounts and Savings accounts were established using an unverifiable fraudulent address to open the accounts online. Bank of America refuses to close the fraudulent account that resulted from identity theft in the form of a checking account. They advised me even though the debit card had been sent to a fraudulent address and that I did not authorize any accounts to be opened with the Bank and even provided them with an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit that was submitted the local police department, they do not wish to assist me and do not want to resolve the complaints. XXXX has recently notified me that the email address XXXX, was and is found on the dark web and was sold by identity thieves. Bank of America Allowed these accounts to be established using said email address. Additionally Bank of America has allowed a Travel Rewards credit card to be opened from the same thief. This was opened XX/XX/XXXX. I advised Bank of America I did not open this account nor authorize it to be opened. Bank of America did not clear my Extended Fraud alert, and refuses to investigate the Identity Theft, Instead they say that Established payments were established using the XXXX XXXX Account that I had XXXX XXXX close due to identity theft, and the Payments made to the Bank of America Account were revoked and or marked unauthorized. The balance on this fraudulent credit account is {$2100.00} Which is being reported to XXXX. I do not authorize you to continually report a fraudulent account on my credit report. Additionally, Bank of America changed the address on this actual account to my address. AGAIN unauthorized, I did not agree to allow the address on this fraudulent account to be placed as my current address. MY Mail had been forwarded at the time the account was established. This has not been resolved is still ongoing and Bank of America continues to cause me monetary loss. Additionally, they will not allow any checking or savings accounts to be established because of the Fraudulent accounts that they have internally. These accounts none of them were authorized. I do not have business with Bank of America nor a relationship with the Bank. Please see the attached FTC Affidavit which is sworn under perjury.

I subscribed with XXXX for one XXXX service contract for one year at {$210.00} only. It is a video web service for conferencing and one subscription is all that anyone would need. 

I contested the charge and BOA credited the account for the two additional charges and began an "" investigation ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, they claimed they had resolved the dispute and re-posted the charges. I contested it again. They advised that they would respond in 30 days. In early XXXX, I sent a certified letter with full documentation of the transaction, their correspondence, and correspondence with XXXX that confirmed that I only have one service subscription. Moreover, XXXX also agreed that they had only been paid for one subscription. 
In my latest ( XXXX ) BOA statement, the dispute issue has completely disappeared. I call them again, protested the charges again, was told a manager would call me back- they never did. 

This is my last resort before I seek counsel and sue BOA for my time, legal fees, and costs. It will be much more than the {$430.00} that is contested. 

Finally. after corresponding with XXXX, they pushed me back to XXXX Technical Service who claim they can not do anything with the issue because BOA has locked them out. 

For reference, the BOA account is current and being maintained."

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX a fraudulent purchase was made on my Bank of America credit card in the amount of {$500.00} at a XXXX grocery store in XXXX MI. At no time were the credit cards ( 2 ) out of my possesion. This charge was also accompanied by 2 fraudulent claims on the same day that were caught by Bank of America and reported to me, where I informed them that it was not me making the purchases. On XX/XX/XXXX when I received my bill, I noticed the charge and immediately reported it to Bank of America fraud department. They removed the charge pending investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter informing me that my fraud claim was denied and I was liable for the {$500.00} fraudulent charge. I did not make the charge, nor was I in XXXX on that day. I would not grocery shop that far from home and the presence of 2 other attempted fraudulent charges on the same day should be enough of a red flag to uphold my claim."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a Bank of America credit card for up to a {$21000.00} credit limit and never used it. The annual renewal notice came due of {$80.00}. It was supposed to be taken from my bank account automatically. I have no idea why it was not. I was then hit with ( 2 ) 30 days, ( 1 ) 60 day, ( 2 ) 90+ days, and ( 1 ) 120+ days on my credit report and damaged my credit report and score *and* they closed the account. I had no idea it was not paid. It was on auto pay. And they never let me know. Keep in mind this account had a {$0.00} balance, {$21000.00} limit, and was never used. This caused my credit score to drop by over 100 points. I called Bank of America several times to resolve, offered to pay this small recurring fee of {$80.00}, and they said they were going to do it, and didn't. I then followed up more times and they said "" there is nothing we can do. '' I own my own home, was going to refinance, and this drastically changes everything."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2021, I filled room inquiry through the online form at XXXX XXXX website, asking availability for a room with bathroom for XXXX person ( XXXX adults and XXXX kids ) for one night stay of XX/XX/2021. 

Instead of giving us a price quote, the hotel XXXX asked our credit card information and said they will not be able to confirm the room without credit card information. After I sent them my credit card information, they replied that our reservation is confirmed, but they never sent us a formal confirmation with specific room types, total room charge and cancellation policy Partially due to the reason that I never received their booking confirmation information, I did not cancel this booking. And XXXX XXXX charged me {$450.00} for XXXX night stay as no show. I do not agree upon this charge. 

I missed the reservation by mistake, but this is not the ground that the hotel can charge me anything they stated. There is no previously agreed upon price nor there is any confirmation of showing how many rooms they were going to reserve for me. I have XXXX adults and XXXX children for the trip. Based on their website description, a cottage for the price of {$230.00} for one night will accommodate my family nicely. But the hotel charged us twice as much. 

This wasnt a fair business practice of charging me inflated price without a previously agreement upon terms by anyone. The hotel never informed me the exact term of the reservation price or room ( XXXX ) in any form of communications. That was partial reason why I missed this reservation The hotel should provide me some form of contract with price stated before my hotel stay. And if I knew the outrageous price of room rate they will charge me, I would certainly cancel this the reservation. 

I dispute this charge with Bank of America. Bank of America denied my claim. I believe Bank of America made a wrong decision and treated its customer unfairly. Bank of American let the merchant freely charge the credit card without proof of any price agreement or receipt. 

The wrong doing of XXXX XXXX not telling their customer of cost of service before making charge is a violation to Fair Credit Billing Act. And Bank of America did not resume the responsibility of protecting its customers from the unfair billing practices."
Credit card or prepaid card,I have been dealing With Bank of America prepaid claims now for 2 months trying to get this fraud dispute taken care of I have called numerous times starting XX/XX/2022 and 2 to 3 times a week in XXXX. They just denied my claim again for he third time. I have sent police report and dispute letter and hardship this has costed me. I'm at A standstill because I don't know what else to do. My wallet was stolen out of the front seat of my car with the card envelope and a couple other cards. Please help me get this resolved
Credit card or prepaid card,"The credit card in question has a monthly billing period that ends on the XXXX of each month. For the bill ending XX/XX/2021, I underpaid the bill by XXXX due to my miscalculation. I always try to pay all credit card bills for purchased made up to the end of the month in which the billing period ends, and in this case, my spreadsheet had a summation error. 
The next billing period, ending XX/XX/2021, stated a New Balance total of XXXX. This total included the Previous Balance of the XX/XX/XXXX billing, the payment made for the bill ending XX/XX/XXXX, merchandize Purchases incurred from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/2021, return credits of XXXX during that same period, and an interest charge of XXXX because of the unpaid balance from the XX/XX/2021 billing. I paid {$1800.00} against this bill on XX/XX/2021. I assumed that my payment of {$1800.00}, an overpayment to the New Balance of XXXX, would cover all obligations due Bank of America. After contacting their Customer Service, I found I was wrong. 
Interest continued to accrue until my {$1800.00} payment was posted on XX/XX/2021 Return credits of XXXX during that period were not applied against the underpayment amount from the last period The next billing period ending XX/XX/2021, has a New Balance total of XXXX. This includes the Previous Balance from the XX/XX/XXXX billing, my payment of XXXX, merchandize charges incurred from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2021, return credits of XXXX for that same period, and an Interest Charge of XXXX. This interest charge was calculated for the period XX/XX/2021 through XX/XX/2021, the date of last month 's billing period payment. 
Thus, the total interest charge for the XXXX underpayment I made for the period ending XX/XX/2021 incurred {$27.00} in interest charges by XX/XX/2021. $ XXXX days of accruing interest = {$0.00} interest charges per day charged to my credit card account. If I never paid enough against my account to eliminate the {$150.00} underpayment amount, or some portion thereof, by the end of one year I would have paid {$0.00} X 365 days = {$190.00} on a principle of {$150.00}. I declare four issues : 1. On no statement was it stated what discrete amount would incur how much interest charge per day unless paid off by a stated date.

2.. Merchandize return amounts do not reduce underpayment amounts for credit card purchases even if the merchandize return is done after the day of purchase.

3. This seems to be an advantageous non-transparency about interest charge liability to the consumer 4. The interest itself constitutes an unfair financial burden to the consumer."

So this has not been an easy process.
Credit card or prepaid card,Charges were charged on my credit card without my permission and the credit card Bank of America is making me responsible the charges. I disputed these charges more than six months ago and as of XX/XX/2020 they have put the charges back on my account ... My credit card is in good standing.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX, someone made a purchase on my credit card at a merchant named XXXX, in the amount of {$420.00}. The next morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ), as soon as I saw the purchase, I called my bank, Bank of America, and notified them that a fraudulent purchase was made on my account. The bank immediately reversed the charge the next day. The merchandise that the person purchased ended up being shipped to my house. I contacted the merchant, explained that this was a fraudulent transaction, asked them to change my password and information, and the merchant provided me with a return label. I sent the merchandise back to the merchant. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the fraud dispute once again appeared on my statement, showing a balance of {$420.00} in regard to the same transaction. I immediately explained the issue to Bank of America, and they reopened the claim. I sent Bank of America an affidavit explaining the situation and provided tracking information to show that the merchandise was returned to the merchant. One again, I explained that this was fraud. 

It has been almost three months since I reopened the fraud dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America to get an update and they informed me that the sent out a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, that simply stated that nothing has changed and that they will not reverse the charge. No explanation given. 

I have been a Bank of America customer for close to 15 years and the treatment that I have received throughout this process has, quite frankly, been appalling. I have a checking account, savings account, and credit card with the bank. I have never missed a payment or had to make a fraud dispute prior to this. As soon as I identified the fraud I notified the bank. As soon as the charge appeared on my account again, after Bank of America denied my fraud dispute, I notified the bank and provided them with the information that they requested. I can not believe that they would treat such a longstanding customer in this manner. 

The amount of time and effort that I have had to put into removing a fraudulent purchase from my account has been shocking. I have called at least ten times throughout this process and been on the phone for close to 20 hours. I am often given a direct phone number to call to get an update. That number is incorrect. Every time I call the number back, I have to be transferred at least one or two times. 

I have never experienced customer service this terrible. It has been almost 5 months since someone made a fraudulent purchase on my card. Bank of America has been slow to respond, sneaky in how they notify me that the charge is being added back to my card, and have provided me with a shocking lack of information as to how I can finally get this resolved. 

Somone fraudulent purchased over {$400.00} of underwear on my credit card. It should not take this long to have the charge removed and rectified. I have tried to remain calm and respectful throughout this process, and provide the bank with the necessary information. I now have a minimum payment due in 5 days. I am worried that my credit score will be impacted because of this. I hope that this can be resolved soon. I do not want other customers to have to deal with the level of frustration that I have had to deal with. 

Thank you for your time and help."

The ATM did not process my payment and did not returned my money. I called the Bank of America customer service right away and they answered my call with 20~30 minutes hold time. I explained to them what happened and they told me that they will review the ATM and process the payment within 3~5 business day. I checked again on XX/XX/2018 to see if my payment has processed or not, but it didn't. I called them again and asked what happened. The customer service rep said there is no inquiries regarding my ATM deposit and they have not processed any investigation. I complained and asked them what happened to my money. She said she has no clue and she will request for inquiries. Now it's XX/XX/18 and still no payment has been processed. I made additional payment using my other bank 's checking account, and that processed right away. Bank of America took my money and not returning nor processing the payment. If I didn't made additional payment using other bank 's checking account, they would've probably charged late fees, additional interest charges and so forth.

I want to sincerely apologize for the delay. Unfortunately, my family and I have faced an extraordinarily challenging time. My wife and XXXX of our XXXX children fell severely ill, requiring my full attention and care. This unforeseen situation caused a significant disruption in my income, making it difficult to meet my financial obligations. 

I assure you that this was an isolated incident, and I have learned valuable lessons from this difficult experience.

I have resumed regular income, and I am committed to making timely payments on my loan moving forward. 

I genuinely value the relationship I have with Bank of America since 2016 and have always strived to meet my financial responsibilities promptly. However, the circumstances surrounding my family 's health crisis placed an enormous burden on me, both emotionally and financially.

Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/2020 Bank Of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Va XXXX Bankamericard Secured Credit Card Dear BANK OF AMERICA, I would like to ask you to reconsider my bankamericard secured credit card application. I recently applied and I was rather surprised to receive a denial regarding my secured credit card application because essentially and according to your website I was suppose to be guaranteed approval. According to your website, the bankamericard secured credit card requires you to place a refundable security deposit that serves as your credit line. 

In your letter, you listed that the reasons for the denial was because there were too many revolving credit lines. However, I have over 100 plus on time payments. My reasoning for choosing this card was due to the numerous positive reviews shared by my family and friends with respect to this card, and its great credit building tools for people with limited or bad credit. The reason for the acquisition of the bankamericard secured credit card is it will prove especially useful to me and help to improve my credit score and build credit over time, thus making certain types of transactions possible which would be advantageous for me. I sincerely believe that I deserve a chance with the bankamericard secured credit card so I can prove to you my reliability and loyalty to this bank. 



I thank you for your time and reconsideration and I hope to hear back from you soon. 

Best,"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My Bank of America credit card was paid in full prior to the payment due date. There was no balance or payment due ; however my checking account was debited for {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, after the full balance was paid on XX/XX/XXXX. On or around XX/XX/XXXX I noticed my account had a credit balance in the amount of {$140.00} and saw it had been withdrawn from my checking account without my knowledge. 

I called Bank of America immediately and requested a refund and was told it would take up to 7 days. After 7 days I checked my account and there had been no activity. My credit card account still showed a credit balance of {$140.00}. 

I called Bank of America again to ask why I had not received my money back and was told it takes up to 14 business days ; now twice as long as I was initially told. 

Today, I checked my account again and there is still no activity. I still have a credit balance of {$140.00} on my card. I called back a 3rd time and today was told it takes 30 business days for the refund to process. 

This is beyond absurd and completely ridiculous. At no point in time has anything taken 7, 14 or 30 business days to reflect on my account. Payments made from my account take 1 day and I am now being told that it will take 30 business days to have the money to be refunded, which was never authorized to be withdrawn."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In late 2021, I called Bank of America to request a reduced APR for my credit card. The person, male, who answered the phone advised me that if I opened a new credit card ( i.e. a second credit card ), if I did that, that I could take advantage of their 0 % interest transfer and be able to transfer the entire amount that was currently on my Allegiant Credit Card to the new Credit Card and have 0 % financing for 18 months. I agreed based on this information. 

The truth is that this was not an accurate statement. So, my credit was dinged by Bank of America for opening a new card. I complained several times to the company. Bank of America offered to close the account- which I understood would ding my credit again, and they agreed that it would happen if they closed the account. But they never provided anything other than we are sorry and will talk to the employee who did this and said these things. 

This still infuriates me as I relied to my detriment on BOA 's representation that I would be able to have 0 % interest on my balance for 18 months. At no time has this happened. 

This is flat out fraud, and I advised them of this. I even called the fraud line for BOA and the only recourse they had was to close the account, which, again, would hurt my credit score. It did not occur to me until today that I could file a complaint with Consumer Protection. 

I believe this is standard practice for BOA to get as many credit cards out to people as possible. I would like BOA to have consequences for their agent's/employees behavior."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened my business account 2 years ago and since then Bank of America has been very poor on services and supporting my business. Since recovering from a pandemic, the business has already crossed the {$300000.00} revenue but Bank of America continues carelessness. I asked for a credit card so many times until giving up and find other cards elsewhere, including from other banks. Recently, I received an invitation to join one of Bank of America 's cards and decided to apply, and surprisingly got denied. Where is the rep to call me and understand my business needs? Why all other banks and institutions gave me credit cards like XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but the bank where I have 3 accounts, 2 businesses + personal have zero support and care?? Hasn't offer one single product to support a small business like ours in spite of our growth. Why sending invitations if even the cheapest card can not be approved?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"***UPDATE : I received a call from Bank of American on XX/XX/2021 in response to my original complaint filed with the CFPB. A woman named XXXX XXXX left a message on my voicemail. However, the number she provided to Regulatory Complaints ( to call her back ) was a faulty number. She said to call extension XXXX to reach her, but the main number I was directed to call said enter a 6 digit extension. I tried the 7 digit extension multiple times as well as combinations of 6 numbers of the 7 she provided. I now have no way to reach her. When I call the main regulatory complaints number, there is no option to talk to an actual person, and the line just hangs up on me. 

I did also receive an email from XXXX that included the same faulty phone number. I emailed the generic email address back explaining how I was unable to reach my assigned resolution specialist since she did not provide a valid phone number. I have yet to receive a response to that email. 

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - On XX/XX/2021, my husband 's car window was broken, and the car was stolen/ driven away. My purse was inside which contained, among other items, my Bank of America credit card. As soon as I realized my credit card I had been stolen ( within a matter of hours ), I called Bank of America to shut down the card. During that phone call, the representative I spoke to asked if I had made a {$1400.00} charge at XXXX XXXX XXXX or a {$16.00} charge at XXXX XXXX. I told her no and said that was fraudulent. We also called the police and filed a police report. Bank of America also sent me an email around this time notifying me that there were suspicious charges on my account. I responded in that email that I had NOT made the charges and that they were fraudulent. On XX/XX/2021, these two charges were removed from my account/bill. However, shortly thereafter I received a letter in the mail indicating that my fraud claim had been denied, and by XX/XX/2021 these charges had been added back on. After receiving this letter, I called Bank of America to appeal the decision and understand why my claim had been denied. The person I spoke to said there had been a mix up because another charge ( that I did not identify as fraudulent ) had been marked as fraudulent. She said she would clear it up in the system and assured me the issue would be resolved. It was not. I received another letter with a denial. Again, I called back. This time I provided the police report number as additional evidence. Again, I was reassured the claim would be reopened and resolved. It was not. The charges continued to stay on my account. I called Bank of America several more times over the coming weeks, each time attempting to resolve the fraud claim. I received another letter on XX/XX/2021 from Bank of America indicating that my their "" decision to decline your fraud claim for this transactions ( s ) has not changed. '' The reason cited was, "" While you personally didn't make the charge ( s ), we confirmed it was made by an authorized user on the account or someone who had permission to use the account. '' This is false as the person who made the charges was a person who had stolen my credit card. After receiving this letter, I called Bank of America a fourth time regarding my claim on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX ( which was the second time I provided the police report number ). During this call, I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was told no supervisor was available. Then, I requested that the claim be escalated. The person I spoke to assured me that I would receive a callback within 24-48 hours because I had requested an escalation to the claim. I did NOT receive a follow-up call, so I called back a fifth time on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. The fraud person I spoke to this time claimed that the police report number had not been entered into the system ( despite the fact that I had provided this on two previous occasions ). He said that the claim would be reopened and within 1-2 days the charges would be taken off the account while the claim was under investigation. I provided the police report number for a third time and two employees I spoke to during the course of being transferred told me that they were filing an internal complaint. Today is Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. The charges are still on my account as they have been since XX/XX/2021. The claim is listed as closed on my online banking message center. I am exasperated as I have been trying to resolve this with the bank and have called the fraud department five times now over the past two months. Each time, I am promised a reopening of the claim and resolution, and each time Bank of America has done nothing to resolve it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank Of America closed my Credit Card ( which i know is within there rights ) even thought i have perfect payment history for over 7 years never missed payment, with no explanation. Issue is i spoke to BOA today XX/XX/2020 about my Credit Card, asking for about my account, and i was transferred to the collections dept ( XXXX spoke to me as noted on my account ) she informed me i was in collections on a account i am NOT late on, with perfect payment history. i requested a reduction on the payments or interest from BOA as indicated to me they closed my credit card account based on my BAD financial situation as they see it. What BOA is offering is Nothing to help me with my account or terms ( interest/payments ) only to refer my account to a DEBT Consolidation company, and to further RUIN my perfect credit standing, as they did by closing my account with NO Reason. Due to there ( BOA ) actions i have suffered a drop in credit standing and loss of credit rating ( a very severe act and an attack on myself by BOA against a past excellent customer ), speaks volumes about the real BOA and how they DONOT value customers and have worst customer service and attitudes with they customer ( which i am now proud i am NOT one of these and never will be again )"
Credit card or prepaid card,"ISSUE : Beware of automated payments from Bank of America 's phone system. I input my checking routing and checking account numbers from the bottom of my check. The system somehow tried to use the routing number and the debit card number rather than the checking number to access my {$200.00} payment. The account was closed without my knowing it. I called when I realized the payment hadn't cleared the bank and made a {$200.00} payment with my debit card over the phone with a live Bank of America agent. She took the payment and it cleared my bank. I was also notified that the account had been closed. I feel that the bank should have called to clarify the problem before closing the card. Especially since the payment didn't clear I feel due to a glitch in their automated payment. 

I feel that they penalized me for the error in the phone system. They said that I input the routing number and debit card number. I don't know how I could have done that when I held the check in my hand and used the numbers from the bottom of the check. So the automated payment system tried three times with the incorrect information. Each time the payment money was in my bank. I am trying to get out of credit card debt and not use the cards, so in a way, since this card is now closed, I am motivated to pay it off, another {$370.00} and be done with it and never do business with Bank of America again."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was charged a late fee for "" nonpayment '' of a {$0.00} ( XXXX ) dollar bill due on XX/XX/2020. 

My monthly payment occurs on the XXXX, and I have autopay set up. On XX/XX/2020 a "" Late fee for payment due '' of {$25.00} was charged against my account. 

I have attempted to contact BofA, but they have no way to contact them reasonably. There is no way to contact them online while logged into my online banking account, they do not have chat, they do not respond to twitter, and the phone lines were projecting almost 2 hours of hold time."
