It has been 6 weeks since I started my request for final inspection and release of remaining funds. CitiMortgage would cancel inspections with no contact or notice. When the inspection was done, it was agreed that 100 % of structural work was complete and minor paint touch up was needed for walls and for floor. \\n\\nCitiMorgtage has decided that they will not honor the 100 % structural and are stating, without contacting me or reviewing with me. At first they claimed that only a 33 % complete inspection was done ( again their XXXX XXXX XXXX system is broken ) and then they have decided that since there is still some plywood in my living room protecting the floor while we finish any painting and getting money to pay for removal of the damaged baby grand piano ... .they have decided that we are only 95 % complete and as such will not release any funds. \\n\\nI am not allowed to get past any phone support at CitiMortgage to talk to an actual person making a decision. \\nThis has been gong on for 6 weeks. The amount for the remaining funds is about {$22000.00}. \\n\\nI am truly dissappointed at CitiMortgage. They come off as a desperate bank that is not interested in letting money, that is not theirs, go.   \n",
       "3  XX/XX/2015 my daughter contacted XXXX to inquire about pricing about a flight to florida. Unknowingly when my daughter gave my credit card number XXXX considers that booking a flight. I disbuted the charge with Citi Bank they denied me stating I book the flight via internet and I read and understood the rules. Which was false. I called and stated This was a phone call and my daughter was on the phone and she is not an authorized user on my account and I should not be charged for an inquiry only. I contacted XXXX explained the situation they apologized for there agents mistake and explained it is company policy that they DO NOT give cash refunds they give flight credit vouchers. Which they did for the full amount of $ XXXX.on XX/XX/2015. I called Citibank and showed them the documentations and they still would not refund me. I then stated I would like to take this to court and let a XXXX make the final decision which they agreed to do. I also stated I am going make an advance payment of {$2900.00} which would leave only the {$120.00} balance in question. They agreed. Time went by I had forgotten about this until I applied for a car loan. To find out the Citi bank had destroyed my credit because i had not made any payments for 6 mo on the credit card. This is after making an agreement with me to let a court make the final decsssion and excepting a payment of {$2900.00} in advance so there would be no problem with a late payment. \\nThis is outright wrong to do to me after making an agreement with me also i could have made monthly payments at no cost to me because i had interest free for 18 mo. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX is aware of this matter.   \n",
